It seems that the only map people play is villa which can get boring after a while and kill house which is mostly used for achievement whores.\\xa0 And when Ubisoft relized noone liked the new maps what did they do they realesed vegas 1's old maps in hope that people would start playing again.

       "   'description': 'Codemasters has been making quality rally racing games for years and having been a fan of Colin McRae Rally 3 in particular, I was looking forward to their latest installment in the series. I can\\'t say I\\'m a fan of the sport since I don\\'t follow it at all, but I love rally racing games because they throw something at you that other racing games like PGR, Test Drive, Need for Speed and GT don\\'t... dirt, mud, gravel, snow, beat up tarmac and the kind of courses you don\\'t see normally. It makes it all alot of fun.DiRt itself is a major step forward for Codemasters. Gone are the days of \"pivoting\". In the older games there seemed to be a central point on the car - sort of a pivot point. It almost felt as though the geography was coming towards you and the car was rolling across it - just like those old car games where the scenery was on a conveyor belt and your car was static, you were just steering over a painted surface. Not any more. Now the cars control as they should and the racing feels more real. In fact, this is DiRT\\'s strongest point... in hill climbs and while descending you really feel the height and the control it takes to keep yourself on the road. This makes the racing more intense and less random - slip up and you\\'re out of control... focus and you\\'ll be amazed at how well you\\'re racing. Of course all the vehicles control differently and you have a choice of racing anything from souped up pickup trucks, to dune buggys, Big Rigs, normal rally cars of all different sorts, to these strange huge box shaped trucks that can easily roll over if you\\'re not careful. The amount of variety is great.You\\'ll spend most of your time in career mode advancing through 11 levels of a pyramid. You will rewarded by different achievements as you progress and I was able to unlock 725 points by playing through career mode alone. There are also a Championship and a Rally World mode where you can get a few more points. The difficulty is Easy. At the outset of each race you can choose between various difficulty options and never are you forced to race the harder options to get achievements - you can get all of them just by racing on medium. You will get more money the higher the difficulty which can make buying cars alot easier, along with the various graphics packs you can get for each car (some of those are very cool). Finally, DiRT makes two important contributions to the video game world. The first is the graphics. As you may have heard, this game looks sweeeettt. Try not to stare at the countryside as it goes by though, or you\\'ll end up smacking into a tree - best to watch as someone else plays. The second is one of the best menu systems I\\'ve seen in a game (along with some of the best menu music). Hopefully others will pick up on this, although nobody seemed to steal the awesome menu system in Riddick, so maybe they won\\'t. In any event, the menu is slick, interesting and very well done.All in all, Codemasters did a superior job in giving us DiRT. Next time I\\'d like to see some more variety in the tracks (in particular the closed course dirt tracks) but that is the only complaint I could really think of.\\xa0If you like racing you should definitely pick this one up.

       "   'description': 'The Good Amusing characters Great campaign Good difficulty Great artstyle Solid multiplayer Steady framerate, even in the most intense moments  The Bad Performing strategic tactics is difficult due to limited optionsOnly 2 players onlineCommunication between players is very limitedThe Review Battalion Wars 2 (BWii for short) is a war game that has a sort of rock paper\\'s scissors style combat. It\\'s a series spinoff from the acclaimed Advance Wars series which are known for their deep tactical strategy and challenging difficulty. While Battalion Wars 2 isn\\'t as hard or as deep, it\\'s still a great game that\\'s fairly engaging.   The games presentation and how it all starts off is very well done. It\\'s a prologue mission which takes place a few hundred years before the game\\'s actual storyline. It\\'s also a tutorial mission and it makes it very easy to learn the game\\'s basic controls. The overall game\\'s learning curve is almost non-existent because of helpful tutorials that show up when a new unit with unique controls appears, such as a fighter jet.  Once the first campaign is complete (which takes less than an hour to beat), you\\'re pretty much into the meat of the game where all the action takes place. The other five campaigns are lengthier, and more difficult than the first one. The campaign overall is noticeably improved from its Gamecube predecessor but it\\'s also a bit easier. The stylistic charm of the game, fortunately, remains intact in this sequel and the storyline continues from the previous game. If you haven\\'t played Battalion Wars 1, don\\'t sweat it. The story itself isn\\'t very complex and, although you may wonder who a few people are, you\\'ll pick it up in no time. The story, though, isn\\'t very special but it is engaging enough to keep you playing. The funny characters and dialogue are all well done and memorable enough.   One difference from BWii and Battalion Wars 1 is that, in the first one, you were constricted to using one empire. In BWii, you are able to play using several empires that each have their own unique units, but in the end, they all still play pretty much the same.  Control-wise, it\\'s all well done and easy to use. There\\'s nothing overly complicated about the controls so there\\'s nothing you\\'ll have much trouble with. You use the Wii remote to point and aim, the B button to fire, the nunchuk to move, the Z button to lock on, and the A button to change unit commands. The only motion sensitive controls there are relate to the nunchuk. For grunts and footsoldiers, you can tilt the control stick to one side and motion with the nunchuk towards the same side to perform a combat roll. You can also flick the remote upward, when you\\'re not tilting the control stick to the side, to jump. It\\'s easy enough to learn and in no time, it\\'ll become pretty much second nature. The C button changes the camera to three different zoom settings which can help out when you\\'re controlling a large tank or battleship that takes up most of the camera space. As for the 1 and 2 buttons, they are only usable in online mode. They are used for very simple communications with your online partner. The 1 button generally asks for help or requests and the 2 button is basically just acknowledging the request. This feature can sometimes be useful but in the end, it could have been done without. It would have been better if these buttons were used for deeper unit control.\\xa0The ability to command units to \"go to\" an area and stay there has been taken out from BWii but was present in its predecessor. This makes the overall strategy portion of the game much more cumbersome and difficult. You have to take control of a unit and have every other unit follow you to a location. Then you must tell them to wait and then switch to another unit to move another part of your battalion elsewhere. This creates a hazardous moment for your battalion in which an enemy could destroy you in the time it takes for all this to happen. By not being able to fully control your units like this, pulling off different strategies becomes much more of a hassle, with such a simple feature gone.  Combat is done easily by pressing the B button to fire your weapons. The Z-lock on is very helpful and allows you to command your troops to interact with a lot of things. Enemies can be attacked by ordering your troops which is done by locking to the enemy, pressing the A button on whichever troops you choose, and taking part in, or watching, your enemy fall. Certain troops are effective against other certain troops so this makes a rock-paper-scissors combat. Anti-air troops are used against, you guessed it, aerial units. Bazooka vets are used against tanks and enemy armoured units. Grunts and Flame Vets are best used against footsoldiers like Bazooka Vets and other Grunts. There are several other units you can use that all come into play with this rock-paper-scissors combat.  Objectives in campaign mode usually require you to capture a flag or destroy something. Capturing a flag can only be done with footsoldiers so make sure they don\\'t get killed. It\\'s simple on how you order your troops to capture a flag and it\\'s the same as ordering them to attack an enemy. You simply lock on to the flag with the Z button and you command your troops you capture the flag with the A button. Simple enough. You can also help to capture the flag by going up to it and flicking the nunchuk (the same way you jump). The maximum number of troops that can capture one flag is five or so. The more units you have capturing the flag, the faster it will go.  Multiplayer is fairly well done and is among one of the better done jobs of Nintendo\\'s limited online service and yes, friend codes are used. It\\'s not really a big deal though. You are also able to play with anybody which is similar to other online games such as Mario Strikers Charged which lets Nintendo pair you up with someone looking for a game to play. But in BWii, it\\'s noticeably more accessible in a way. There are three types of modes you are able to play online. Skirmish, Assault, and Co-op. You are able to choose one of these modes to play and you are also able to choose a map you want to play on as well as your empire of choice. Then, Nintendo pairs you up with someone wanting to play the same game as you. If you don\\'t care for choosing a map, you can pick the \"any\" choice. If you also don\\'t feel like choosing between these three modes, you can also use the \"any\" choice which chooses a random mode with a random map. One thing is also assured with online: there\\'s practically no lag. Everything runs smoothly and reacts fluidly.Even with this great online, it feels like it could have much more potential. If it were 4 player battles instead of 2, this would have made a huge difference to the overall feel and intensity to the game. Of course, there\\'s always lots of chaos even with 2 people, but it still feels like it could have been done much better had it been 4 or so. As well, the communication between players is limited. It can only be done in Co-op missions meaning that this simple feature eliminates the use of 2 buttons, which could have been used to add better control of your battalion. You can tell your partner to eliminate a target, defend an objective, or watch your back, but it\\'s difficult to properly create deerp strategies with your partner.   Graphics are also a step up from Battalion Wars 1. Lighting and Bloom effects are more noticeable and it\\'s been smoothed out as well. There\\'s rarely a frame rate drop and it all flows together. Textures and environments are a bit drab and some parts look rough and washed out but that\\'s all made up for by the vibrant colours and smooth character models.   Audio sounds as it should. Since the game is a light-hearted game with more of a cartoon-like artstyle, it just sounds, like I said, as it should. The Wii-mote speaker also works well and provides some nice reloading and shooting sounds that don\\'t sound bad at all unless you turn up the volume. The soldiers chatter is amusing and gunfire, explosions, and all that sort of stuff sound great. The dialogue and voice acting in the game fits the games style and, while some might find it a tad annoying, it\\'s done properly.  Overall, Battalion Wars 2 is a great war game with a healthy difficulty, a great campaign, and fun multiplayer. It radiates with charm and is loaded with style. This game is not for everyone but it\\'s quirky humour can make anyone smile. The gameplay and strategy is a little too simple for those looking for a deeper strategy experience but satisfies anyone looking for fun, light-hearted battles with lots of chaos.',\n",

       "  {'deck': 'Worthwhile shooter, but not a revelation on PC as it was on 360.',\n",
       "   'description': 'Gears of War is the one game that nearly tipped me into buying a 360. Here was a visceral, beautiful, action-packed shooter getting tons of buzz from gamers and press. I could barely keep myself from plunking down the $350 just so I could get a taste of this first-hand. Alas, the infatuation faded. I couldn\\'t seriously justify buying a console for one title, so I put it to the back of my mind. Fortunately, Epic threw PC gamers a bone in late 2007 by announcing a PC port, alongside their other humdrum release, Unreal Tournament 3.Now it needs to be said Gears of War on PC in 2008 is not Gears of War on 360 in 2006. They\\'re two completely different experiences, so while I am going to argue that Gears on PC right now is fairly lackluster, in no way am I saying I don\\'t see why this was such a huge deal on 360 two years ago. I get it. I got it. OK. Moving on.So what\\'s good about Gears on PC?First and foremost, you get 5 additional chapters at the end of the game (about 2 hours of gameplay or so), plus a satisfying (albeit simple) boss fight with a gigantic weaponized beast called a Brumak. These levels also occur in larger spaces with less linear funneling as the core console game, which gives you a greater feeling of general chaos and a little more immersion b/c the levels feel more like actual real-world spaces, rather than tightly designed video game levels.The other nice perks on PC is simply the K / M controls (which work fine, don\\'t listen to people whining about the keyboard) for precise aiming, and cranking the graphics settings all the way up for a incredibly impressive looking game that gives Crysis a run for its money.The core gameplay in Gears is enjoyable but simple. Small pitched battles in insanely detailed environments with a lot of movement behind and around cover. Enemy variety is actually limited to a half-dozen type, so battles do become repetitive as the game wears on. There are a few mini-boss battles where you\\'ll be using the Hammer of Dawn to call satellite barrages from the sky. And while Gears is a game focused on much smaller battles than its XBox peer, Halo, it does carry some of that same \"epic\" feeling of survival and helping your friends on the battlefield that Halo is known for.Story-wise, there\\'s not a lot going on in Gears. There\\'s something about being imprisoned for something and your father does something or another, but really it all just boils down to you and your buddies shooting aliens in a post-apocalyptic future. Voice-acting ranges from decent tough-guy marine talk for the protaganist, Marcus Fenix, to downright stiff and wooden for your sidekick.Unfortunately, there are some significant detractions to playing Gears on PC.Most notably is -- the game engine runs like crap. Even on a current-gen PC, you\\'ll suffer through occasional screen lockup, stuttering, random texture pop-in. You also have to deal with Games for Windows LIVE, a nebulous Microsoft service, just to keep track of your saved progress in the single-player campaign, as well as all patching is done through GFW Live. If, like me, your GFW Live account is unable to apply content patches b/c it kickstarts your motherboard\\'s BIOS update instead, then you\\'re basically stuck with a game you can\\'t\\xa0 patch.Online and co-op play must also be done through GFW Live, so good luck finding anyone on a server, let alone convincing a friend to install that garbage on their PC and meeting up with you for a session.Which is really too bad, because co-op gameplay is clearly where Gears of War shined brightest. The ease and simplicity of playing co-op on 360 with friends cannot be duplicated on PC. (At least not with GFW Live. If you could play the game over Steam ... that\\'s another story.) So that\\'s a major strike against the game.It also doesn\\'t help that Epic waited a year to release this port, so not only was all the release buzz and anticipation dead in the water, but many gamers (myself included) have already played other games with cover/shoot mechanics they stole from Gears, which completely steals the thunder out of what was a true innovation in 2006 and is now just another expected feature in action games in 2008.So all in all, if you can get Gears PC used, or borrow it from a friend, it\\'s well worth a playthrough. Just don\\'t expect anything too deep or immersive and enjoy shooting the crap out of gnarly beasties and grunting with your buddies in power armor.',\n",

Although recently Sonic has been in a rut of sorts. It seems Sega has had quite a bit of trouble taking 2D Sonic and letting him roam in the free 3D world, unlike Nintendo mascots. It seems that Sonic was outrun by everybody else. Now, finally, it seems by making it an on-rails game Sonic has finally picked himself up and is ready to run again.  The point of the game is to zip through various levels getting the fastest time whilst avoiding enemies and various obstacles. Although this is the main story, there are 100 missions for you to complete. They are indeed not all basic concepts as getting to the end of the level as fast as you can. There are many things for Sonic to be doing. Some missions ask you to collect a certain amount of rings in the fastest time possible or finish the course without collecting a single ring! Some ask you to race against a spirit, and others want you to defeat a certain number of enemies.  If a mission is finished in a good time, you will be rewarded a medal. A gold medal automatically unlocks one of the massive amount of unlockables, silver medals need to be collected before unlocking something, and same goes for bronze although you can only unlock only a limited amount of things with a bronze or silver medal. Which medal you get is determined how fast you completed the mission objective. Sega and Sonic team have also introduced a new element to Sonic and the Secret Rings. They have added a certain RPG element. How well you do in a mission determines how many experience points you get. These experience points, like any RPG, level Sonic up. As Sonic levels up, he learns new abilities. There are about 100 or so of them. Some examples of what these abilities allow Sonic to do are:  Go faster Brake faster Turn quicker Gain more experience Increase pearl collecting ability  And many more. These skills are quite helpful along the adventure as they can make many missions quite a bit easier. One skill called the splash jump allows Sonic to flip over walls if he collides into one in midair. This is extremely useful in saving Sonic from falling into pits and making jumps as he can just splash jump along the edge to climb over a particularly large wall or obstacle.  Although there are many skills, not all of them can be used at the same time. To maintain which ones Sonic will use, you can organize them in one of four rings Sonic has. These can be customized before missions. This adds a much needed amount of depth to the Sonic series and it's truly a welcome addition. Unfortunately, some of these skills seem like they should be game settings and essentially only provide control settings. This creates a problem with the difficulty level as well as with the controls.  There is a mutiplayer mode included to complete the package, although it is a minigame collection. It invites you and your friends to pick up a Wii remote and start playing games with Sonic and other characters from the Sonic universe. These minigames are fairly shallow and don't have much replayability. You and your friends will get fairly bored of them within a short while. Although these games are a nice thought, there are already plenty of minigame collections for the Wii on the market which are much better than this one.  Overall, the on-rails gameplay is fairly well done and fixes many problems that previous 3D Sonic games failed to accomplish, mainly being the lack of speed. It also fixes up the camera issues for the most part. Backing up is not only a control problem, but a camera problem as well since it doesn't allow you to see back properly. Also, some missions are designed poorly and make it impossible to attempt at your first time unless you get around the problem by a fluke.These problems are things like enemy spawn spots and some level build problems. As well, most just require luck (dinosaur eggs!) and are frustrating to complete. The game's rewards are great, though, so completing these missions is satisfying, especially if the level was quite difficult.  The graphics are also a strong-point in this game. With lots of detail to enemies, backgrounds, and environments, this is one of the better looking games you can find on the Wii.\\xa0 Some textures are a little washed out but since you'll be going so fast, you won't be able to notice it unless you stop and bother to examine them. As well, explosions look a little grainy and 2D. Even so, the frame rate never dips despite a lot of action going on. Explosions, lots of enemies, and intense speeds don't stop the game from keeping a nice and steady frame rate. The games art direction is also well done and creates a perfect melding between Sonic and the Arabian theme.  The music to the game is fairly interesting. It mixes traditional Arabian music and puts a classic rock spin onto it. Some of the songs are flat out awful but others have a nice rhythm and provide a nice atmosphere to the up beat and speedy action in each level. The voice acting is where the main problem is. The voices fit for each character, but it's all fairly exaggerated and it sounds a little annoying. Sound effects are well done. Explosions sound a little unreal and some of the effects sound a bit tinny. Other effects, like ring collecting, are still solid. There's nothing exceptional to the sound effects quality but nothing awful either.  There is a lot to do in this game. If you zip through the story, it will probably only take you about 7-10 hours. But with so many missions to do, so much to unlock and collect, and to get all gold medals and fire souls, the game will last you a long, long time. Perhaps roughly 50+ hours. Although it can be sometimes a little discouraging to try some of the harder levels and get gold medals in them, the rewards are satisfying enough. So while there is a lot to do in this game, you might not necessarily not want to pick the Wii remote for a while.  Wii remote controls are easy enough to use and it's very responsive. Turning left and right is as easy as tilting the Wii remote. Using the homing attack requires you to jump and flick the remote toward the screen a bit.This truly is a good game but with a little more time, the game's difficulty settings and obstacle placing problems could have been fixed. As well, some controls with backing up or turning can be a bit annoying. It's definitely not for everyone as many people will be discouraged by the difficulty but with a lot of unlockables and content, a decent story, and some incredibly high speed thrills, you will want to give this game a try.\",\n",

       "   'description': \"Brain age 2 is here to train your brain with more brain teaser mini games. This time around it's sightly better, but by just a little bit. Brain age 2 is a sequel to a Edutainment game called brain age, which was popular among adults, and even some teenagers. In the sequel the only two things that have changed basically is the sudoku puzzles and the quantity of mini games. So if you did'nt like the first game at all then stop reading and turn back. If not keep on reading to get the scoop.Brain age is made by a man who studies the brain in a Japanese university. This game does'nt offer a storyline nor plot but purpose. the purpose was to design a software to train the brain. His fact is the brain is like a muscle you need to train it like a arm, but with mental activities. Use this software to keep your brain in good shape to make life easier and be in better shape mentally. Brain age 2 mainly is appealing to teenagers who want some extra help before tests, quiz's, or who to play brain teaser mini games. It also appeals to adults who need improvement with their speech impediments, brain farts, or who have brains in bad shape. This does not appeal to kids at all.Brain age 2 works in the same way the original brain age did. You play mini games that involve you to write signs to complete simple math problems using the ds touch screen. there are also scrambled words rotating and you must unscramble them and write the word. There are 11 mini games that increase the quantity of mini games. Your overall goal is to answer a certain number of problems as fast as you can, or get all 5 levels correct. When you finish you get a speed from walking to rocket speed depending on how fast/ well you did. You can also do local multiplayer with up to 16 people which really improves it, but you can't do online multiplayer. You can also do three difficulties in sudoku, which has new fresh sudoku problems. There are also some mini games with two choices, hard or normal. Every now and then you get warm ups when you open your account like connect the dots to provide a image you see then name it and compare it to what it really is supposed to look like. You can do brain age tests like number memory or tests the exact same as some mini games to get a brain age. The best score you can get is 20 years old.The game is mostly in 2D, except the doctor's head. So the graphics are not in HD like ps3 games are. The game itself does'nt have any problems except the hand writing and speaking is still shaky, but no bugs which really takes some stress out which the shaky part puts back in. the doctor does not speak but does the words into a bubble thing. You do not get any music when playing sudoku or minigames only at the menus and even then the music is alright nothing exciting. So brain age 2 is a failure at making great graphics and has gentle decent music. It's music in the piano game is the better music because it lets you play some good old classic music on your ds piano.We all form our own perspective on a game it could be good' or it could be bad. But in order to form a perspective we need to know about the game. I found out about the game through a commercial. After that i looked at screen shots to found out about what the mini games are gonna be and through the trailers to found out more about it. So the question is here should i invest money into it? I say yes because it's only $20 which is really cheap and even though the graphics suck and music is kinda decent I think It's solid fun you can enjoy for a good amount of time. I had fun playing it myself so it's recommened by me because I have fun playing with 16 other people and having a healthy brain while playing simple math or vocabulary. It's even fun to unlock games and unlocking more songs to play in the piano mini game to enjoy listening to while hitting the notes right. I think this has some good value and is worth your $20. \",\n",

       "   'description': '(written in February 2005)I\\'d been anticipating Echoes for a long while by the time it was released, and it was everything I expected from Retro\\'s follow-up to Prime. The game essentially starts like every other Metroid game: something has run afoul for the Galactic Federation, and they\\'ve contracted Samus to investigate the incident. This time, some of the Federation\\'s soldiers have been lost on the rogue planet Aether. Samus discovers that this world is entwined in war between the Light and Dark forces, and must put a stop to it. The only thing that it\\'s missing is the \"wow factor\" that Metroid Prime hit us with back in 2002, but Echoes does what it can to make up for that. The controls haven\\'t changed since 2002. Everything is how it was: move with the stick, shoot with A, jump with B, lock on with R, and so on. This is more of a blessing than a curse, because the saying goes, \"if it ain\\'t broke, don\\'t fix it.\" It also becomes easier to delve right into the game without worrying too much about whether or not the control scheme will be hard to adjust to. The dynamic of a Light and Dark world has been done before in Nintendo games, but not like this, for the Dark World actually harms you. Depending on the suit you\\'re wearing, you\\'ll take certain amounts of damage depending on how long you spend outside of \"safe areas.\" It adds an entire strategy-like thinking component by forcing you to think of where you should go and how you should move about in advance, especially when confronting enemies. One drawback is that beams can require ammunition. You can only use them a limited amount of times before needing to reload, which is slightly a step back from the original. But as I said before, it requires more of a strategy this time around. While in Prime, you could often get away with running into a room and bombarding enemies with fire, you need to conserve and ponder your moves this time. Such was the approach one took in Prime when an enemy was hurt by beams, but greatly damaged by missiles. This can get very tedious, but is forgivable in two ways. One, that is gives us a new way to play instead of rehashing the old system even more so. And two, most enemies can be destroyed with the Power Beam if you\\'re stingy with ammo. As previously stated, the \"wow factor\" that Prime hit us with is no longer present, so just because it\\'s a sequel, it doesn\\'t really have that originality working for it. How does a game make up for this? By just being a gem to look at, that\\'s how. The environments range from cramped to majorly expansive, but the fine detail and textures are always present in everything, from the pesky enemies to the huge industrial buildings.  Framerates are constant, and there is no noticeable skipping or lagging, save for a door that may take a few seconds to actually open, but that\\'s nothing new from Prime. Even though the game is slowly-but-well-paced and makes you want to get from point A to point B, sometimes you\\'ll wanna just stop at a cliff and look out into the valley below, complete with a sunset out on the horizon. Story has never been a strong point for the Metroid series, as I\\'ve come to learn, but Echoes sure does what it can to put a story to a game that is basically consists of shooting things that get in your way.  (**There are no major spoilers ahead.**) As Samus arrives on Aether, she learns from the Luminoth, the Light race, that a Phazon meteor struck Aether long ago and forced it to break into two worlds, each in separate dimensions. Without spoiling much, this other Dark Aether is essentially stealing Light Aether\\'s energy and has produced the hostile horde race the Ing, who fight the Luminoth for control of Aether. Only one Aether can survive, and Samus is to take up arms to save the Luminoth from eradication, like the fallen Chozo. But to make things worse (even worse than a world teetering in an interdimentional vortex), the Space Pirates have discovered Aether\\'s Phazon and are determined to harvest it for themselves, but they\\'re nothing compared to the shadow known as Dark Samus. It\\'s origin in unknown, and it\\'s threat is extreme. This isn\\'t a game that you can finish in two days. Well, there are those out there who are devoid of enough life to do so, but it\\'s best to spread this game out. This seems to be the longest game so far in the Metroid series, but never truly feels like it isn\\'t going anywhere. And as is with every Metroid, it\\'s life can be drawn out to months if you so wish to find everything in the game. Multiple playthroughs are recommended, even if you aren\\'t looking for everything. Of course, there is the highly publicized multiplayer mode. In terms of being Metroid multiplayer, it\\'s something, but don\\'t expect anything revolutionary. It probably would\\'ve worked better on the N64, to be honest. In some parts, you can get away with just shooting each other with powerful weapons and pile up the kills. It is also pretty easy to tell that this is Retro\\'s first attempt at multiplayer. The missiles are homing and inflict serious damage. The Light Beam blinds you and disrupts your lock on opposing layers. Some power-ups, such as Death Ball, are way too overpowering, as you can guess by it\\'s name. However, depending on the map and your skill level, these can be either good or bad things. This makes the game feel more like Goldeneye than Halo 2, but, depending on what you\\'re looking for, that may not be a bad thing. The music is very atmospheric and moody, and fits in with its surroundings; a slight techno in the factory of the Great Temple, a sleepy, sombre yet nervous melody within Dark Aether. All sound effects work greatly as well. You can tell where you are based on the sounds of Samus\\'s footsteps, from soft dirt to solid rock to industrialized steel. All enemies have their own unique sounds as well, which works to your advantage; if you\\'re about to turn a corner and don\\'t know what you\\'ll be facing, often you\\'ll be able to listen for whatever is there. However, a major complaint that comes with Echoes is it\\'s lack of voices. All major games have voice work in this day and age, yet Nintendo still keeps Metroid without them. Yes, it\\'s true this is a very solitary game, but even in the cutscene with dozens of Marines getting attacked, you can\\'t hear any of them screaming as they fall, only their guns going off. There are some voices, such as your suit\\'s computer when scanning something important (which is still pretty cool), and Samus when she gets hit, but there is such a sense of isolation that almost anything, even the A.I. from Metroid Fusion, would be welcome in some of the situations that come up in this game.Echoes is more than worthy than being the sequel to one of the finest games ever made. The core fundamentals of the game remain very similar, but are different enough so that Metroid Prime 2 is just as engaging as Metroid Prime was, yet has a feel and fun level all it\\'s own. The only thing wrong with Echoes, really, was its release date. Highly recommended to anyone of the Nintendo way of thought, and even those who aren\\'t.',\n",

       "   'description': 'To be entirely truthful, Metroid Fusion was my first real experience with the Metroid franchise. I played Super Metroid back in the day, but until recently it didn\\'t have an impact on me. When I finally got bored of Zelda and Mario Kart and ran out of games to borrow from other people back in early 2004, I figured Metroid Fusion would be a good bet; at least it had some connectivity features with Metroid Prime. Oh, did it have so much more than that. Chronologically, Fusion is the last Metroid, taking place some time after Super Metroid. With a search team deep in the depths of SR388, the Metroids\\' home world and location of Metroid II, Samus is attacked by a strange jelly-like creature known as X. X is actually a parasite and almost kills Samus from the inside out. Her Power Suit gets corrupted and has to be removed surgically, but even then she has a minimal chance of survival. But then, someone finds a cure. As it turns out, Metroids were the main predators of X, and a Metroid cell culture (made from the Metroid Samus saved in Metroid II and which saved her in Super Metroid) is used to make an anti-X vaccine, which works on Samus instantaneously and essentially changes Samus\\'s cellular makeup. This is where the game gets its name; Samus has fused with the Metroid. Back from the brink of death, Samus is contracted to investigate an explosion at the Biologic Space Labs where her team sent all of the specimens from SR388, and this is where the game begins. As I have learned since, Fusion deviates from the classic Metroid formula in the sense that the game doesn\\'t let you wander around and explore on your own. From the outset, Samus is given orders from an A.I. that she names Adam that point the player in a more-or-less straight line throughout the game. This formula may turn off more classic players, but it also makes Fusion the perfect \"beginner\\'s Metroid\" because of the features and quirks of the series it brings without the worry of getting lost and frustrated. For example, the is one part in Sector 4 of the space station that requires Samus to acquire the Speed Booster to break through a wall so she can lower the water level. While in say, Super Metroid, if you are unable to find the Speed Booster after a while, you\\'ll begin to wonder whether or not you\\'re actually in the right place, and all too often this leads to the player leaving the area they\\'re in to search somewhere else, never knowing how close they were because eventually, the frustration will win out and the game will never be touched again. However, in Metroid Fusion, Adam doesn\\'t let Samus out of the area she\\'s in until she\\'s accomplished the task he\\'s set forth for her, so that\\'s one off the list; you know you\\'re in the right area. Even so, the several sectors are all huge, and it\\'s very easy to get lost in them. This leads to learning another Metroid staple: shoot and bomb everything, because there\\'s always something hidden, whether it be a very important passage, a column to stand on or just another missile tank. The areas (or \"sectors\" as they\\'re referred to in-game) are all self-contained with maps Adam gives you, but there are so many hidden and unmapped portions that learning to find the hidden wall or one breakable block is just as important this time as it has been in adventures past. Metroid Fusion also contains some very high quality cinematics for a Game Boy Advance game, which lead to it being the most story-driven game yet in the Metroid series. The opening of the game recounts Samus\\'s near-death experience with many very sharp still-frames and a few animations that help draw the player in like few games of this size have done before. Once the story of the SA-X gets going, you will actually finds yourself with chills a few times thanks to the quality artwork, great graphics and superb music, especially with the music. More than once did my spine tingle with fear when I found the SA-X chasing me to a very panicky theme, or when the music comes to halt and it is too quiet; much like in old movies, this elevates the feeling of tension fivefold. After Fusion, I went on to play Zero Mission, finish Prime and Echoes and finally play Metroid and Super Metroid and love them all to death, but despite it\\'s difference I always remember and occasionally come back to the one that started it all. The redeeming value that led me to go with Fusion in the first place was its unlockables with Metroid Prime, and given the frustrations I had with Prime at the time, it\\'s quite possible that if I had never played Metroid Fusion, I wouldn\\'t have ever played a Metroid game I liked ever again. Play Metroid Fusion. You won\\'t be sorry you did.',\n",

       "   'description': 'Being a Nintendo loyalist all my life, I never enjoyed Sonic in it\\'s full glory. There was a time years ago when I had a Sega Genesis temporarily, and Sonic 2 was all I\\'d ever want to play. Having only recently caught up with the world of GBA with the Classic NES series, I realized I missed out on Sonic\\'s immersion into Nintendo\\'s family. Sega\\'s latest offering, aptly titled Sonic Advance 3, was a game I\\'d heard good things about, so I decided to give it a shot. Believe you me, it was\\xa0money well spent. The controls are fairly standard for Sonic, with A to jump and the pad to move, but you can\\'t get too confusing when a game gets as fast as Sonic can. The levels are much longer, sometimes taking a good seven minutes to find your way through, and therefore much more challenging. It looks and feels completely new, and yet has that feel of Sonic 2 and 3; the use of trickier puzzles, but also keeping the sheer speed of the level. The new partner system can get you out of some bad spots. For example, playing as Sonic with Tails as your partner, you can hold the R shoulder button, let it go, and be vaulted high into the air. This comes in handy when you\\'re underwater and are running out of air. Another example is if you pair Sonic and Knuckles, Sonic can fly on Knuckles\\' back for a short time if you hold R and jump. New to my eyes as well are two of the characters, Amy and Cream, even though I know they\\'ve been present in the Sonic universe before. I know nothing of their back story, but their addition, along with Sonic, Tails and Knuckles, make for numerous partner combinations when playing through each level, offering different paths every time, meaning this isn\\'t a game you can merely play through once and be done with. SA3 wows with it\\'s use of colour and level design detail throughout. In the first world, a highway called Route 99, while the gameplay difficulty varies by skill level, the different pathways, character and enemy sprites, and especially the backgrounds will keep your eyes going back and forth between your character and the scenery. Another example, in Zone 2, Sunset Hills, there is a constant orange hue to many things, which perfectly conveys the idea that dusk is at hand. Even so, you never fully lose sight of what it is you\\'re trying to do, making the Sonic Team\\'s use of the GBA even more impressive. The music for each level is well done, to say the very least. Each zone\\'s background music goes with what the area is; that is, Zone 99, a highway, has a faster pace, while Sunset Hills, a hilly-grass area, has a slightly more relaxed tune, one that is reminiscent of Green Hills from Genesis. Each character has a few little voice snippets here and there, for events such as dying (Sonic yells, \"Whoa!\"), level completion (\"All right!\"), and boss defeat (Robotnik yells \"You\\'re going to pay for this!\"). Several sounds, whether or not they were in previous Sonic Advance adventures, were pretty much present in the Genesis days, such as the invincibility theme remixed (which I\\'m told is present in both other SA games), the ring sounds, the 1-Up sound, and so on. Even though I\\'ve said you can\\'t be over and done with this game after only one playthrough, you\\'ll wonder why you decided to play through it again so soon if you were to immeadiately restart. The new character combos are interesting, and I\\'ll admit I\\'ve done them a few times. However, I think this game is best served as the old ones were: play it, be done with it, then come back to it at a much later date. I originally played through it in a day and a half, left it alone for over a month, and then was able to pick it up again and play through it again as if I\\'d just bought it all over. When it comes to rent or buy, buy this game, because it\\'s best served over a long period of time. I was never a fan of 3D Sonic games like Sonic Adventure or Sonic CD, or even the really old Sonic 3D Blast. I\\'d also never played either Sonic Advance before. Recalling that old Genesis, I can say Sonic Advance 3 honors those games of yore, but also does it\\'s own thing. Sonic Advance 3, whether or not you\\'ve ever played any other Sonic game, is a great addition to the GBA library. I suppose it\\'s slightly ironic that it took the release of the Classic NES series and the retro Game Boy Advance SP to get me to take a look at what a truly classic series has managed to do with itself over the years. On the consoles, it is going in new directions, but here on the Game Boy Advance, Sonic the Hedgehog has truly found himself a new home, and his new home is well worth almost any price.',\n",

The controls during the actual golfing gameplay are a pocket-sized version of Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour\\'s, which is a very good thing. After selecting a club for type and distance, you merely aim your shot on the Course View screen, press the A button to start your swing, and A again when the Power Bar at the bottom reaches the end. You can add different mechanics to your shot by using the Control Pad to hit the ball in a place not in the middle, and therefore have it curve in the air. Redesigned for Advance Tour from Color, just as was new to Toadstool Tour from 64, is the Manual shot. Instead of pressing A and A to shoot, you press A and B, and then press A+A when the bar reaches the end for \"topspin\" (having the ball spin further after it lands), or B+B for \"backspin\" (the ball will stop where it lands and possibly roll backward). This adds new dimensions that, while present in Toadstool Tour, is all new to those who played Mario Golf 64 and Mario Golf Color. RPG elements also liven the game up. Feats accomplished throughout the game, such as winning tournaments and match games against other players, will grant you experience points which you will use to level up both your character and you partner (the character you didn\\'t choose at the beginning). Attributes you can increase are such things as driving distance, shot (fade or draw), ball impact, ball control and spin. You will need a strong partner in the game, so keep their levels equal, and keep their attributes relatively even. Don\\'t go upgrading drive forty times or anything, because your character\\'s game will suffer for it. Story Mode holds the most for those who played Mario Golf Color. In MGC, you would choose one of four characters to play as: Joe, Sherry, Azalea, or Kid. In MGAT, all characters return as the course champions you must defeat. One of them was even your new character\\'s teacher. Plus, in doubles play, their respective partner is the former champion you played to defeat in each respective course in Mario Golf Color! Yes, Putts, Grace, Tiny and Gene Yuss are also back, and with two champions per course to top, this game gives you everything to play for. The AI in this game is based on equality. As previously stated, there are two characters to choose from at the beginning. You\\'ll choose one to control, and the other becomes your partner for such things as doubles tournaments. In doubles tournaments, you\\'ll go up against a club champ and their partner, and how well you play will determine how badly your partner plays. Yes, that\\'s right, the better you play, the worse your partner plays. The entire point is to not be too overpowering, as you will undoubtedly become if you\\'ve played long enough, but to still play well enough to win. It\\'s a challenge all it\\'s own to not play so well as to negatively affect your partner, yet play well enough to be able to win. Mario Golf: Advance Tour is a very pretty game. Developed by Golden Sun\\'s Camelot, MGAT bears a positive graphical resemblance to Camelot\\'s RPG gems. It\\'s very colour-rich, which is a big thing for a game that takes place mainly on a green field. No two sprites look alike, and the game makes you dread seeing certain colours, because the courses are colour-coordinated very well to show you where hazards are and such: in other words, an evenly green surface (the fairway) is good, while a very light brown (a sand trap) or other varying darker shades of green (rough, heavy rough) are bad. On the green, there will be tiny arrows to show you which way the green in sloping, so you\\'ll be more able to accurately putt. On later courses, the layout can be very Mario-esque: Piranha Plants dot the landscape, threatening to gobble up stray balls, and lava alongside the fairway, in all it\\'s red, fiery glory. Even on the world map, it looks positively incredible, yet you won\\'t forget it\\'s a Game Boy Advance game that you\\'re looking at. The sound effects are very clear and crisp. The sound of the club hitting the ball is not simulated, but the exact sound. It also varies from where the ball is hit from, so that hitting out of a sand trap sounds like what hitting out of a sand trap should sound like, a sort-of \"twap\" sound, as compared to the \"whack\" of hitting off a tee. The music in all of the courses are all updated mixes from their respective counterparts in Mario Golf Color, but sound all-new. It wasn\\'t until a match game at the Palms Club, the game\\'s second course, that I realized this; as before, a single-player tourney at a given course has different music than a match game at the same course. All playable characters have their own voices, as well, at certain times. When sinking a birdie putt, one character will cheer \"All right!\", while she\\'ll slink to her knees and moan \"Oooh!\" if she loses on a hole. Every character has their own little celebration or dismay saying. This game is absolutely perfect to just pick up and play, whether you\\'ve got hours to spare or are just waiting for a bus. The number of minigames that are playable in Story mode alone can set you back by a few hours. All Mario characters are playable, as well as the Mario Golf characters and Ella and Neil, your created ones, in Quick Game mode, in which you can play as any character against any other character in such modes as Stroke Play, Character Match, Speed Golf, Near-Pin, Star Tournament and others. If you play as either Ella or Neil, you can even earn more EXP for more leveling up. All in all, there are 18 total characters to choose from after unlocking them all, and 8 of them have both Normal and Star levels of difficulty, giving you a total of 26 unique characters. One of the more remarkable things is Advance Tour\\'s connectivity with Gamecube\\'s Toadstool Tour. If you link the two, Ella and Neil will be downloaded onto your Toadstool Tour save data for use whenever you want. If you use them in anything, they will gain even more EXP depending on the task. (If you were to train on a certain hole, you\\'d gain less EXP than if you beat a character in a match-play game) Also, accomplishing certain tasks in TT unlocks features in AT. All Mario Golf games have \"birdie badges,\" which you obtain for scoring at least one under par on a hole. Four of the eight Mario characters are unlockable in this way. There are also \"Star Courses,\" which are special versions of the four club courses. Accomplishing tasks, usually with Ella and Neil, in Toadstool Tour will get you more of these special holes. (Changes to courses include warp pipes, extra play panels, a Mario Kart-type box that gives you rewards, etc.) All in all, playing more courses in Toadstool Tour will surely increase your pleasure with Advance Tour. Golf was never a very appealing sport for me, but when the Mario Golf series started on the N64\\xa0all those\\xa0years ago, it was a very fun approach to it. Two more MG games later, Mario Golf: Advance Tour has, for the moment, capped off in tremendous fashion what MG64 started. Camelot has created a game that has all the fun parts of golf, with many fun elements of Mario, and none of the real drawbacks of either. This game actually inspired me to go four-for-four and find Toadstool Tour, because the two complete each other, and I couldn\\'t let this game go without some of the parts that make it incredible. It belongs in almost any collection, because it\\'s golf the way it should be, and if you\\'ve had any pondering of whether or not you should own this game, ponder no more: you must own it.',\n",

       "  {'deck': 'Excellent game all around, Zelda or not',\n",
       "   'description': 'December 25, 1993. The first present I opened that morning was my first Game Boy, along with two games: Tetris, a staple in those days, and The Legend of Zelda: Link\\'s Awakening, the newest chapter in Nintendo\\'s successful adventure franchise, as well as Link\\'s first foray into Game Boy. Over a course of many months, I slowly but surely progressed through Link\\'s Awakening, and even as other games came along, it remained my favourite game on the original Game Boy. October 1998. A fevered pitch is running through the video game world. After a five-year hiatus, and six years on home console, The Legend of Zelda was very soon returning with it\\'s latest installment, Ocarina of Time. Along with the Nintendo 64, the Big N\\'s Game Boy handheld has also had the benefit of the use of newer technology, and thus the Game Boy Color had been born. It was seen as an opportunity to show to a newer generation of Nintendophiles one of the greatest games they\\'d never played, as well as give those of us from back in the day a shot of nostalgia. Well, with The Legend of Zelda: Link\\'s Awakening DX, they did exactly that. Despite being already five years old when it was released \"new,\" the gameplay was still as good as ever, despite the fact that you could still only use two items at a time, something which only miffed me after A Link to the Past and the ability to always have the shield ready. It\\'s not very complicated; it\\'s very easy to pick up and not worry about what you have to do. The top-down perspective never fails when dealing with the 2D adventure genre, and Zelda has always benefited from it. Various weapons, including the famous Sword, the Roc\\'s Feather, the Hookshot, the Fire Rod, the secretly hidden Boomerang and even the first appearance of the Ocarina (albeit not the one of Time) are some of the weapons included in Link\\'s arsenal. After having to make due with green-and-yellow (and then black-and-white with Game Boy Pocket) graphics for nine years, the colorization of Link\\'s Awakening was certainly a sight for sore eyes. It\\'s actually a testament to how good Link\\'s Awakening was in 1993 in that all that was needed to update it was the many colors. There were no major graphical enhancements at all; in fact if one were to play this game on an original Game Boy (which is possible), there would be no way to tell this is another game, save for the clouds and extra date and letters on the title screen. The sound is as good as can be expected. All tunes are new, without any remixes or new versions of previous Zelda themes (save for the hidden dungeon, which has a remix of Level 9 from the original Legend of Zelda). However, the feeling and idea behind the music remains the same. The villages have their peaceful, serene melodies, the minigames have a tune you can hum to yourself, the overworld is heroic (for lack of a better word) and unlike any Zelda before it, the dungeons all have their own themes, each one foreboding and \"dungeon-like\" in their own way. The Ocarina even has three melodies you can play, each with their own magical effect. There was actually a very good story, despite the fact that it is indeed a \"side story\" of the series and does not have anything to do with Hyrule, the Triforce or the princess herself. Link has become shipwrecked on an uncharted island known as Koholint Island. A girl named Marin finds Link washed up on the beach and explains that since he arrived, monsters have begun to wreck havoc on the island. Link sets off to the beach to recover his lost gear, at which point a mysterious owl approaches him and explains that a mythical creature known as the Wind Fish sleeps on the island, and that in order to escape the island, Link must awaken the Wind Fish by retrieving the eight Instruments of the Sirens, each hidden within the eight treacherous dungeons on the island. Faced with little choice, Link sets off to fight for his freedom, as well as the island that needs him. Seeing as I\\'d played this game many times in it\\'s original form, it wasn\\'t difficult to find my way through it again. However, while not difficult, the original was no slouch, and the few things that were added in for the DX version made it that much more appealing. One such addition is the extra dungeon that is hidden under a graveyard, which emphasizes the use of color. For example to gain access, two Stalfos guard the entrance, and you must tell them which color shirt they are wearing. Puzzles within the dungeon include matching colored blocks in a correct pattern, and tiles that turn red mean the floor is about to collapse. The prize for finishing this dungeon is \"The Power of Color\", a choice between two new tunics that either upgrade your attack or defense. The other extra is the Bucket Mouse, a rodent photographer who takes photos of Link at certain times throughout the game that can be printed out on the Game Boy Printer. Some photos can only be taken during certain mini-quests or before you access certain areas. There are twelve photos in all, and even if you don\\'t have the Game Boy Printer, they\\'re still fun to try to find. There is nothing wrong with this game. Really, all it\\'s missing is the feel the original gave me when I first played it, and even then that\\'s nothing I should be complaining about. An excellent adventure all around, and probably the best GBC game available.',\n",

       "   'description': \"I spent many nights back in 1999 playing this game against friends. Back then the Dreamcast was king, and this was the best game on that system. Now, nearly 10 years later, the Dreamcast is (sadly) on a shelf in my closet. On the rare occasion when I did get those same friends together we'd break that game out, blow the dust off the dreamcast, hook it up, and play it. Now that it is on the 360, though, I can play it a lot easier. I agree it should have the missions and online, but the greatness of this game was player-vs-player sitting in the same room shouting at each other as we played. Well worth $10 to be able to do that without having to cable up the Dreamcast. Now I can just boot it off the 360 hard drive. It is still a lot of fun to play, and it is amazing to me how well the graphics hold up nearly 10 years later.\",\n",

       "   'description': 'As far back as 2000, when the Gamecube was first unveiled to the public at that fateful Spaceworld, Nintendo was saying how amazing they could make the connectivity between Gamecube and the forthcoming Game Boy Advance, and all the games, features and ideas that could take advantage of it. However, the way it was first described to the public was little more than a dream as the two systems panned out. What GC-GBA connectivity ended up being was a little more than being able unlock bonus features and such in one version of a game if you\\'d completed something in the other, and vice-versa. Square attempted to do it right with the four player Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles, but all it was was that each player would use their own GBA screen as the inventory menu, while controlling their character on the TV screen. Leave to Nintendo themselves to finally show us how it\\'s supposed to be done with The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures. Each time a player enters a house, a cave, falls through a hole or anything else, the game shifts flawlessly from the TV screen to the GBA screen while suffering only a minimal graphical reduction, which one would expect. Four Swords Adventures has two modes of play: Shadow Battle, which is really just a \"last man standing\" mode, and Hyrulean Adventure, which is the main mode and bulk of the game. Much like the GBA version that was included in A Link to the Past, the game focuses on both competition and cooperation. The goal as a team is to use all your combined powers to advance through the levels, yet you\\'ll all have ulterior motives, for Hyrulean Adventure also awards the player with the highest amount of Force Gems, the in-game treasure. For the less social, fear not, this game features both solo and multiplayer modes, but this game definitely shines as a multiplayer game. The story has been crafted to go along with the need to have a situation with multiple players. A being called Shadow Link escapes from a sealed realm and kidnaps Zelda, and the only weapon capable of fighting him off is the legendary Four Sword, which, upon pulling it out of its pedestal, transforms Link into four separate colour-coded Links. However, the sword was also the seal holding the evil wind sorcerer Vaati prisoner; needless to say,\\xa0Vaati escapes and The Links set off across Hyrule in order to save Zelda and put of stop to Vaati, as well as the other evils that lie in wait for them. It\\'s not as fleshed-out as a usual Zelda game, but it\\'s not bad by any means. If you just all try to backstab each other and grab money, you\\'ll never get anywhere. Huge blocks, pressure-activated switches, hundreds of swarming enemies, such things would be impossible for one Link. Therefore, the game demands that players work together. One thing that makes this a requirement is the puzzles that require several items. Each player can only carry one item at a time, and all classic Zelda items are here, such as the Fire Rod, Bow & Arrow, Pegasus Boots, Roc\\'s Feather and so on. Many puzzles require more than one item to complete, and many others require all player to have the same item. Whether by necessity or not, by the time you reach game\\'s end, you\\'ll be cooperating with your fellow Links very well. One thing unfamiliar to Zeldaphiles in FSA is how contained the game is. There isn\\'t one huge world like it\\'s been in the past, but rather, it\\'s been broken down into worlds and levels, much like the original Four Swords. This can make the game either much more tolerable or much less, depending on how much effort you\\'re willing to put into your playtime, because you can only save your game at the end of each level, and some levels can last a long time depending on how well you\\'re cooperating with your other players. But like the very idea of a multiplayer Zelda game, this works in the game much better than it sounds. Graphics-wise, don\\'t expect to be amazed. In fact, don\\'t expect anything at all, because if you do, you\\'ll be fine. FSA looks greatly like A Link to the Past, only with more depth that you couldn\\'t really expect on either the Super Nintendo or Game Boy Advance. Many little effects, such as a bomb exploding or a puff of smoke a defeated enemy emits, seem to have been taken right out of The Wind Waker, as well as Link\\'s appearance and the appearances of many other characters you\\'ll run into. When making the transfer to the GBA, the game retains most of its visuals, only losing its minor subtle effects, like the way smoke wafts from a fire or Link suddenly loses his shading, much as he looked in Four Swords. It\\'s really hit-or-miss here; either you\\'ll appreciate how the linking works, or you\\'ll dislike how the graphics aren\\'t supposedly up to speed with the technology. Although, if the latter\\'s your train of thought, you\\'ve really missed the entire point altogether, haven\\'t you? Music and sound are always an important factor, and here Nintendo delivers. Most tunes are remixed from previous Zelda games in one way or another, and sound effects are all those you remember too, from the sword swiping to bombs exploding to Link yelling. When having two or three friends working with you to progress through a level, it\\'s always pleasant to have the classic overworld theme playing, or to hear the fairy fountain theme on the menu screen, or to have the fanfare when a treasure is discovered or a secret door blown open. It allows for each player to become more immersed in the experience, not to mention it\\'s just freakin\\' cool to hear them all. One thing that makes for some fun is hearing a song and then all of you try to pinpoint which Zelda game it came from originally. Try it sometime. Everything that is great about Four Swords Adventures still can\\'t truly make up for the game\\'s one giant flaw, if you can call it that: it only works with multiple players. The solo game has much less value, although the ability to control all four Links in different formations isn\\'t all bad. Also, level layouts may or may not differ depending on whether or not you\\'re alone. Usually, the single-player puzzles are easier, but not always. There are other things for people to complain about as well. Some people may not like that you can\\'t keep items or heart pieces or gems going from one level to another. But in the end, Four Swords Adventures does exactly what it set out to do: be both a Zelda game and an incredibly fun multiplayer experience all the same.',\n",

       "   'description': 'Running four disks, perhaps one of the most insanely over the top intro’s in gaming, and a sometime obtuse and initially slow plot that centers around an amnesiac immortal warrior: Hironobu Sakaguchi, the creator of Final Fantasy, delivers a product that is far from subtle in what it’s trying to do. Clearly a Final Fantasy game in disguise, Lost Odyssey is clearly trying to encapsulate the JRPG genre from the first Playstation era. Lost Odyssey’s core story themes and traditional turn based battle system are nothing new to veteran JRPG gamers. But like any standard Final Fantasy game, Lost Odyssey does enough to twist the tired and true formula to make it original and perhaps one of the, surprisingly most engaging, JRPG’s to be released in a while. Even with the bizarre, but too predictable Unreal engine related technical shenanigans.\\xa0  The main protagonist, Kaim, has a story starts that initially seems simple but in true fashion expands to the basic heroes off to save the world. I don’t want to spoil much so ill give a very bare bones synopsis. Your standard steampunk magical planet (housing a citadel city that looks identical to Vector from Final Fantasy VI, get ready for a lot of location/gameplay mechanic comparisons between the two series.) is home to several wandering immortal characters. One of which (of course) decides to become evil. Throw in political turmoil regarding a “magical industrial revolution”, which is exactly as it sounds and we have the beginnings of a typical JRPG outing with: Countries at war, weapons of great power being used, and an evil immortal orchestrating the entire charade. Instead though, the brunt of the story is focused on the characters of the party, and not the bare bones threat that prepares to mess up the planet. Each immortal character is host to dramatic back stories, personal problems, and genuinely well written dialog. The game was created with the English localization in mind, characters lips are properly synced and emote appropriately. The blackmage/comic relief archetype Jansen, runs the gamut of improv setting a sense of sanity to the affair while the two child characters of the party (whom are a bit annoying.) are voiced by actors who speaks at an appropriate decibel. It’s not perfect by any means, but in comparison to localizations of JRPG past: It’s light years ahead of the competition. With the option to play it in Japanese and a multitude of other languages, Lost Odyssey has the presentational aspect covered. The game has multiple cutscenes and is generally paced well throughout it’s first, third and forth disks, having pacing issues and general weirdness in it’s presentation (key sequences not voiced.) in it’s second disk. There are some impressive tragedies here, one of which ends the first disk. (Because, again, like a traditional Playstation Final Fantasy: The first disk must always end negatively.)\\xa0 Not every character is developed properly. But it should be noted for every mistake in its presentation there is a genuine scene of satisfaction. Rounding out the character development with novella style flashbacks that are superbly written, coupled by some incredibly deep characters and social situations and you have one of the most memorable JRPG’s to come out in recent memory. Let’s just say for the first time, in a long time, the main typical silent anti-social protagonist in a Japanese game has a fairly legitimate reason, to be the way he is. Keeping in theme the battle system in Lost Odyssey is turn based with random battles. Recently it seems there has been a neat influx of more active style battle systems in JRPG’s. I always chuckled a bit when I read a reviewer felt that Lost Odyssey’s dedication to this style was a step backward and that active battle systems are some brand new gameplay concept that has recently revealed itself. My copy of Tales Of Phantasia that dates back to 1995 seems to have umbrage over this opinion. Not to say one style is better than the other, but simply slamming the style of gameplay because of its traditional designs is a bit awkward. Especially for Lost Odyssey because it actually does things to these gameplay mechanics that I actually felt rectified many of JRPG game design since its inception. If you were one of the many vocal critics of Final Fantasy’s different direction in combat in XII, or simply one of the thousands of people who have been purchasing and being content with this concept of turn based battles: Welcome to your new game. Characters learn the traditional set of skills and abilities (via an item/skill learning system from FFIX.) The game incorporates a “Wall” system, in which front row characters absorb damage dealt to back row spell casters. (Making battle formation actually meaningful.) But this system is overshadowed by the level cap system in play with each dungeon having a level cap stopping character evolvement for a dungeon when reached and putting you at the same level as the dungeon boss. Grinding becomes obsolete in these situations forcing you to prioritize on stradegy, not typical brute force. Lost Odyssey is hard. While there are admittedly tricks and skills to beef up your characters to god like power if you wish later on, if you only apply yourself to the main quest: prepare for a challenge. Strategy takes center stage and the game reminds you why you play turn based games in the first place. Sadly, Lost Odyssey like most Unreal powered games is full of technical problems mostly involving long load times. Instead of loading the game’s textures as you play (Mass Effect.) Lost Odyssey loads everything before showing. It never broke the game for me: It was admittedly annoying but not earth shattering. Personally I don’t think it’s appropriate for the game from  that uses Unreal tech to be the poster child of Unreal tech complaints when so many other titles that use this engine have similar problems. (Again I’m looking at you Mass Effect.) Lost Odyssey has a total of 1100 achievements, 100 of those come from an incredibly difficult and time consuming DLC dungeon. Unlike Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey’s achievements make sense and are actually quite simple. Certain ones such as learning the every immortal character’s skill and the almighty Treasure Trove achievement (Get every field treasure chest.) are time consuming.\\xa0  It’s quite simple: If you’re looking for an engaging JRPG on your xbox 360 and are a fan of Final Fantasy, check Lost Odyssey out. It might not reinvent the genre, but it delivers a memorable experience that all JRPG fans will appreciate.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0',\n",

       "   'description': \"Resident Evil 4 is a horror FPS game which does things a little differently compared to the other Resident Evil games. Sometimes in a good way and sometimes in an extremely horrible way. You play as Leon Kennedy, a survivor of the Raccoon City incident that occured during the events of Resident Evil 2 and 3. He now works for that government and is sent on a mission of find and rescue the President's daughter who has been kidnapped by a mysterious cult. There's a sighting of the President's daughter in an isolated village in Europe and Leon investigates. While he is there the villagers start attacking him for an unknown reason so Leon has to find the President's daughter and find out the secret of the village. There are no zombies this time around. I know what you're probably thinking. 'But its a Resident Evil game, the only thing you do is shoot zombies'. Yes, that is true but they have been replaced by something so original (/sarcasm) that it will make you think, 'Wow, why didn't I think of that.' Possessed humans, fully equiped with pitchforks, axes, knifes, other whatnot that has a sharp end and dynamite sticks. Gone are the absolutely horrible (and somehow awesome) 'frozen' camera angles. Instead of the camera pointing at you in some awkward position, the camera is in an over-the-shoulder position which is alright but it seems like its been done, which it has, many times before. Almost the entire game is an escort mission. I hate escort missions especially if they make the NPC who's following you a complete idiot. Unfortunatly sometimes in this game, your partner does something so stupid that it makes you not want to care about her and just push her into a mob of charging blood-thirsty villagers. The guns in this game range from pathetic to freakin' awesome. You start off with a handgun and, if you are like me and chose the easy mode (which I'm pretty sure is Wii exclusive), a shotgun. You eventually get a sniper rifle which is hopeless in a close-up situation, a rocket launcher and a few different types of grenades like the hand and flash grenade. The enemies are good and bad at the same time. The case for the game says that the enemies work together but I've never seen them once perform this feat. The enemies react differently to where you shoot them. Shoot them in the feet and they stumble to the ground. Shoot them in the arm and they drop their weapon. Shoot them in the head and they die. Sometimes. Ammo is everywhere in this game. They are in boxes, the enemies drop it but you can't buy them from the salesman who looks like one of 'them' and will turn on you at any moment. When you run out of ammo, you are screwed. This time you have a knife if you run out of ammo so you aren't as screwed as you would be if you ran out of ammo in any other Resident Evil game. The whole game takes some advantage to the Wii's motion sensing capabilities. You aim using the wiimote, slice the knife by shaking the wiimote and thats actually it but I don't blame the lack of motion sensing abilities because that's really all you can do with it. In short, this is another Resident Evil game, just revamped with a whole new way to play. I highly suggest buying it and keeping it.\",\n",

This gaming warehouse contains 5 full games, all of which have their own perks.PortalPortal is a first-person shooter\\xa0puzzle game involving, you guessed it, portals. The game features story driven gameplay, and uses comedic situations to draw the player in, to create an amazing experience. Portal features an updated version of the Source engine, so the graphics and physics are stunning, and the same can be said for the game\\'s sound. GLaDOS is a pleasure to listen to, thanks to the voicework of Ellen McLain, and everything from the sound of the portal gun firing, to energy balls bouncing off walls is a treat. The gameplay is top-notch as well. The portal puzzles have you thinking quickly, and on your feet, so there\\'s a lot of quick fun to be\\xa0experienced. Sadly, the game can be had in about\\xa0three hours, leaving players with hunger for more Portal.Half-Life 2, HL2: Episode 1, HL2: Episode 2Half-Life 2 \\xa0is a first person adventure, set at an undetermined amount of time after Half Life. Released in 2004, Half-Life 2 was considered by many to be the pinnacle of gaming. Great, story driven gameplay, stupendous graphics, and believable characters all made Half-Life 2 an excellent experience. Although a bit dated in this day and age, Half-Life 2 is an experience ill-replicated by any other, and should be played by everyone.The episodes are \"expansions\" of Half-Life 2. They continue on the plot, beginning from the end of Half-Life 2. They are episodic, are each about three hours in length.Team Fortress 2Team Fortress 2 is a multiplayer-only team-based first person shooter. Being the sequel to Team Fortress, Team Fortress 2 had a lot to live up to. Thankfully, it delivered on that, with stunning, unique visuals, and amazing gameplay. From the moment you boot Team Fortress 2 up and join a game, you are completely immerssed in the constant struggles of Red and Blu. You have the option to choose from nine classes, each with their own special abilities and weaknesses. Every aspect of the game is fantastic, from the cartoony, almost cel-shaded comic book style characters, to the screams of a player calling for a medic. The game even goes as far as having a hilarious taunt for each of the characters weapons, which can allow for some comedical situations. The only qualms I have with Team Fortress 2 would be that, if you are on an unfamiliar server, teamwork tends to be fairly lax, and that can lead to a disgraceful losing streak.On the whole, The Orange Box is a breathtaking collection of some of the finest games in history, and should be experienced by everyone.',\n",

       "   'description': '**Originally written October 6, 2003.**Being a sports fan with a Gamecube isn’t as easy as it is for my PS2 or XBOX counterparts, but fortunately for myself and those of you like me, EA Sports has created an impressive game in NHL 2004 that is rather a step up from it’s previous year. NHL 2004 has lost none of its predecessors’ excitement, and when you start this game up, you will more or less lose yourself in the thrill of everything that makes hockey exciting, and then some.Presentation: 9The days of playing a hockey video game just to actually play a game are long gone. The modes Tournament (international competition), Season (an entire season of selectable length, followed by the playoffs), Playoffs (the four rounds leading up to the Stanley Cup), and features like Create-A-Player are as welcome as they always were. The Elite Teams (the top teams from the German, Finnish and Swedish leagues) add a whole lot to fans of European-style hockey, and Dynasty Mode is a gem for anyone who has as much of a fancy to the day-to-day operations side of a hockey team as much as the on-ice side.Graphics: 9As a veteran of EA Sports’ PC hockey games, I’ll admit this somewhat lacks in my mind as part of my tilt, but is actually very good in most cases, such as the fluidity of motion during gameplay and close-ups of players. After a while of playing, you come to appreciate how good the game looks so you can focus more on actually playing it. Camera angles leave something to be desired, but in-game ones work pretty well, and Replay mode allows you to see a recent clip from wherever you want.Controls: 9It requires a generous learning curve to get everything down, with anything from ten minutes to a couple of hours, but after a while, the easy-to-learn controls are secondary in your mind. The game’s default buttons work rather well, but can be customized to fit a player’s preferences. With five skill levels, this game is right for anyone, from a rookie to Igor Larionov. And in case a player is still unsure of playing, in Beginner mode, the announcers, Jim Hughson and Craig Simpson, will help you with in-game hints, such as how to win face-offs, effectively passing, poke-checking, and what a certain symbol next to a player’s name means.Sound: 9Hughson and Simpson make this seem like something on Sportsnet, with their play-by-play and colour-commentating true-to-life, although once in a while you may hear the same five comments throughout an entire period, and their comments can range from overly-generous to near-cruel. In-game sounds sound realistic, such as ice scraping, players getting checked into the boards, players yelling at one another, and the crowds chanting and cheering. Also in NHL 2004 is a pretty good soundtrack, with licensed artists such as The Ataris, Autopilot Off, Alien Ant Farm, Jet, Gob and Bowling for Soup, among others. Whether these tracks fit with the game of hockey or not is really up to the person playing.Overall: 9This game is close to great in all it’s ways. The only real problem with it in passing is it’s use of memory card space. (Saving all features at once requires a staggering 270 blocks!) However, odds are you won’t be saving more than two or three modes at once, and all progress is saved on the 15-block EA Sports Bio, which can also be used with other EA Sports titles. Of course, if you happen to own a 1019 memroy card, this is no problem. When you get down to it, NHL 2004 is a great hockey game for almost any type of hockey fan who is also a gamer. Between buying and renting it, go for the buy, because there’s a very good chance you will spend more if you rent it, because you’ll want to rent it again and again. (And again.) ',\n",

The higher you place on a track the more points you get. Whoever has the most points after the 4th track wins.\\xa0The Balloon Battle is almost the same as the other ones where you shoot each other the burst all of their balloons.

Just race.\\xa0On an item called the Blooper with turns some parts of the screen black, the effect is ruined when versing other people because you can easily see where you are by looking at the map. Graphics: The graphics are pretty much great except for the fact that some items don't seem 3D and it looks flat in some places. Sound:  This game has some nice music, sound effects and voices. Replay Value: With the mission mode and online multiplayer and unlockables you will keep playing this game for ages!

       "  {'deck': 'Exception to the FPS \"rule\"',\n",
       "   'description': 'I don\\'t play many first-person shooters, but XIII (thirteen) is an exception to the rule of space marines and alien hunters. I received it as a gift several months ago and let it sit on my shelf until I had the idea to dust it off, and I\\'m glad I did. Tight controls, a gripping story and an incredibly stylish look make XIII stand out from the pack. XIII is based on a Belgian comic book that began in the mid-1980s, and Ubisoft took that \"comic book\" feel and translated it onto the screen in a unique way. The game is cell-shaded and tries to look like a comic-book in motion, with pop-up windows, enemy conversations in speech bubbles and visible sound effects ranging from \"Kaboom!\" to an enemy\\'s footsteps as \"tap tap tap\". Despite the real-world locations and enemies, there is always a level of slight ridiculousness to the entire thing even as enemies are shooting you from every which direction and your health is plummeting and you\\'re forced to stop staring at the scenery and pop caps in everyone around you. Speaking of which, the PS2 controls are exquisitely mapped, almost to the point of being the FPS control scheme by which all others should be measured: left thumbstick to move, right to rotate camera, Square and Circle to cycle through your weapons, left and right to cycle through your non-weapon items (medkit, lockpick, etc.), X to perform actions such as opening doors and grabbing NPCs as well as reloading weapons, L1 to jump, L2 to duck, R1 to fire weapons and R2 to use a weapon\\'s alt. fire mode (such as firing grenades or zooming in with a sniper rifle or cross bow). After five minutes these controls felt like second nature, minus to occasional annoyance when I would cycle through my weapons too quickly and get killed by a sniper before getting my own sniper rifle out. The story represents something we see often in movies and books but very little these days in games: a good old political conspiracy and the only person who can crack it is an amnesiac. The original comic was heavily influenced by The Bourne Identity novel and the game doesn\\'t really try to distance itself from that idea. The game begins with a man being woken up on a beach by a lifeguard and the man can hardly walk straight, never mind remember who he is or why he has the Roman numeral XIII tattooed on his torso. But within minutes dozens of armed men storm the lifeguard\\'s hut, and even without a name XIII can take them down, all of which serves as the game\\'s tutorial stages. As it turns out, U.S. President William Sheridan has recently been assassinated and the man wanted for his murder is Steve Rowland. The problem is that YOU are told you are Steve Rowland, only the memories don\\'t fit. After being arrested by the FBI but before being allowed to make any sense of what is happening, XIII gets rescued by Jones, a tough solider who knows XIII is innocent because she knew him before the amnesia and has been working with him to expose the conspiracy behind Sheridan\\'s murder with the aid of one General Carrington. With Jones\\' help, XIII sets off to piece together his past as well as exposing the network known as The XX. The story is solid and flows very well, but be warned: as was the tendency of many games, movies and TV shows in the early 2000s, XIII doesn\\'t actually end and the discovery you make right before the badly-placed \"to be continued\" is a huge kick in the privates and will likely leave you steaming, more so because no sequel has ever come out and likely never will come out. The game is broken down into 30+ levels spread over 13 missions, and covers such expected but not unwelcome areas such as apartment buildings, a snowy military base, a mental hospital and a nuclear missile silo. Given the constant need to restart at previous checkpoints rather often (of which there are plenty, happily enough) I\\'d say it took me maybe nine or ten hours to get through XIII on the lowest difficulty setting. The actual music evokes mystery and tension masterfully, but if there\\'s anything negative about this game, it\\'s the voice acting. David Duchovny, Eve and Adam West all do fine jobs as XIII, Jones and General Carrington, respectively, but why get known actors at all? Studio voices would have done just fine, even more in this case because Duchovny and West just can\\'t disassociate their voices with Mulder and Batman. Perhaps Ubisoft should have used the money hiring them to polish their AI instead, because even as tight as enemies\\' smarts can be, every so often there will be a soldier or two who will run past you to check on a fallen comrade as you fire a shotgun into his gut, or the patrolling sentry who doesn\\'t notice that his partner twelve feet to his left just got hit in the head with a crossbow bolt and will continue not noticing because the body isn\\'t on his very strict path. Overall XIII is a rather superb game. It falls down in a few places, but it is so easy to and so worth the while to help itself pick itself up that if you ever get the chance, give XIII a whirl. If you don\\'t enjoy good controls, a suspenseful story and an oozing style, then you just hate good, well-built video games.',\n",

       "   'description': 'The politics of gaming is something that many of us in the online community have to deal with on a daily basis. There are those who will always favour one system, or one company, or one game above all others, and this becomes all too apparent in some people when reading something they\\'ve written. Of course, it\\'s possible to justify, such as when two or three systems get the same game and comparisons will be made, usually placing one version above the others for reasons only the hardcore or insane really care above. For the rest of us, any version of a game will do, as long as it is intact and it is still fun. The Nintendo GameCube version of Tom Clancy\\'s Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is just such a game. The first Splinter Cell was more or less intact from Xbox to Cube, with only a few parts changed, such as a room being omitted or a path being changed. This had no real impact on how great I found the game to be. Pandora Tomorrow was altered significantly, with the online multiplayer being taken out, the graphics not as great as they should be and some lagging here or there. However, all in all, even with different controls, it played the same way, and was also very enjoyable. Chaos Theory was really developed with the Xbox and PC in mind, so there will be differences in appearance. However, you\\'d really have to love being able to look at a slightly better background for all of twenty seconds to really favour one of the Microsoft versions, not to mention that the GC version is on two discs, which allows for more room for such things as the cutscenes, which don\\'t suffer at all. The gameplay is essentially the same as before, which is nothing bad. Your objective as Sam Fisher is to sneak into enemy territory and accomplish your mission without being seen if the mission calls for it. One thing you\\'ll notice right away is that, while looking good, the graphics aren\\'t as great as they should be on the GameCube. After experiencing such games as Metroid Prime, The Wind Waker, Resident Evil and most recently Resident Evil 4, I\\'ve come to know the limits of what the Cube can pump out, and this is not it. Some levels can be so dark night vision almost becomes necessary. Brightness adjustment on your television set can offset this, and all in all it\\'s not so bad. The controls have been mapped to the Cube controller in a way that seems awkward, but work extremely well after adjusting to them. I actually feel as if I\\'m playing an older game while I play Chaos Theory, because to do many things, you must hold down the Z-button and press another button with it, and doing this reminds me of doing numerous combos in older 16-bit games. Sometimes it can be annoying, however. For example, changing guns is Z + C-Left, and whistling to attract guards is Z + C-Up. I can assure you, you will mix these up more than once, much to your chagrin. Chaos Theory feels very complete in comparison to the first two. In Splinter Cell, the characters were introduced, and Sam accomplished Third Echelon\\'s maiden mission without fail. Pandora Tomorrow felt too similar, much like an expansion pack rather than an all-new game. It still had its moments, though, including new voice actors for Lambert and Grimsdottir, plus the CIA man D.P. Brunton. In Chaos Theory, Lambert\\'s original VA is back, and Brunton has been replaced by the much less-annoying William Redding. Before every mission, Lambert, Grimsdottir, Redding, and whoever else involved in that mission will brief you on what\\'s going down. You even get to choose your arsenal based on your preferred approach: \"Stealth\" if you plan to sneak around more, \"Assault\" if you intend to get your hands dirty. There is also \"Redding\\'s Recommendation,\" which is essentially a combination of the two with a couple of unnecessary items omitted. Level design is also much more complete. Whereas the first one was mainly indoors, and the second one was largely outdoors, Chaos Theory blends the two very well. For example, the first mission is on an island with a lighthouse. You start the level on a beach, and then creep your way through underground tunnels before reaching the guerrilla hideout, which is a series of large and small buildings. You\\'ll never stay in or out too long, even the mission is mainly in one of the two, such as when you must rob a bank. You begin that stage in the bank\\'s courtyard, sneak around the building and then eventually sneak inside, only to be able to return outside later on. There are the numerous new moves that Sam has that makes Chaos Theory feel much more fluid than either of the first two. Now equipped with a dagger, Sam can slice an enemy\\'s throat open as he passes by, and can also stab them in the back if holding onto them, both by using the R-button. The L-button makes Sam us non-lethal force, such as punching a guy or choking him into unconsciousness. There is also the move Sam can pull off while hanging from a ledge. If an enemy sentry walks by, you can press the A-button to have Sam reach up, grab the enemy and pull him off the cliff, or building, whatever the case may be. Something that drives me insane is the lengthy load times the Cube version of CT has. Here\\'s the sequence of events when putting this game on: Cube load screen, Ubisoft logo, Dolby logo, CT title screen for 30 seconds, choose language, load profile (15 seconds), load mission (20 seconds), load progress (20 seconds), load level (30 seconds), load exact location (15 seconds). And then, during a mission, you\\'ll have to load certain areas one after the other. (For example, when you play the bank level, you start in the courtyard, then once inside, you must load three different wings, which each can take half a minute to load.) While I do love the fact that I can save absolutely anywhere, as opposed to annoyingly-placed checkpoints, the loading this game requires makes me second-guess that compromise. Whether these load times are present in any other version is unknown to me. Something interesting about CT is also how the missions aren\\'t totally isolated from each other. There are \"primary\" and \"secondary\" objectives. The primary ones must be accomplished before extraction is possible, but the secondary ones aren\\'t entirely vital. If you fail to accomplish a secondary objective, you will have to accomplish it in a future mission. There are also \"opportunity objectives,\" which are the ones you can choose to do should you get the chance. The GameCube version has two exclusive features: Sam\\'s water-grab move, and GBA connectivity (of course). The water-grab is like the ledge-grab, except Sam can wait in deep enough water and then grab and drown an enemy, rather than throwing him to his death. However, the GBA connection is disappointing this time around. In the first two, connecting your GBA would give you a radar of the surrounding area and locations of yourself, enemies and non-enemies, sort of like Metal Gear Solid. However, in Chaos Theory, there is a map provided in-game, and it even provides you with red squares to tell you which rooms your objectives are in. The GBA merely shows you this map on its own screen, instead of the handy MGS-like radar from previous installments. However, you can view all of your objectives on the GBA as well. One new feature I absolutely love is the OCP, a special attachment on your pistol that allows you to disrupt almost anything with an electric current, such as certain lights, certain cameras, and other things like computer monitors and electric windows. Instead of having to shoot one of those out and risk having a sentry hear you, you can merely disable the light or camera and sneak past, plus the OCP causes the malfunctioning item to emit enough noise to disguise your passing if an enemy is indeed nearby. Sound is also more important in this game, because now there is actually a small gauge for it to let you know how loud Sam is. The small square on the bar represents the allowed level of noise, and anything above the square increases the risk of you being heard. Another new feature is the EEV, which is a visor mode that allows you to view and find objects that you can interact with, such as a computer, light or microphone. You can access and hack objects from a distance with the EEV, and can toggle all your different visors as well. Even though the online component is missing, the two-player co-op mode is available on this version. Having two players cooperating can be fun, but once again, the controls are mapped in such a way that it will take you a while to get used to them, and even then you may not enjoy them. There are only a few co-op levels, but they are fun just the same, and it\\'s interesting to see the kind of objectives that would require two agents instead of just one. Is Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory a good game? Yes. There are those out there who would say that this game is absolute trash because it doesn\\'t look as good as it should. That may be true, but the real question is, is it worth playing of you own a Nintendo GameCube? That\\'s a resounding yes. Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is the Splinter Cell game we\\'ve all been waiting for. If you can do with some patience, pop this game in and get ready to have fun.',\n",

Despite the fact that the GC version was just fine, when I finally purchased an Xbox I felt I needed to exchange it for the Xbox version. And while from most points of view the two versions are identical, it\\'s a number of little things that make the Xbox version of Tom Clancy\\'s Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory the better game. The first Splinter Cell was more or less intact from Xbox to Cube, with only a few parts changed, such as a room being omitted or a path being changed.

However, all in all, even with different controls, it played the same way, and was also very enjoyable. Chaos Theory was likewise developed with the Xbox and PC in mind, and it shows. The gameplay is the same, and while I did harp that people have to be insane to really enjoy looking at polished backgrounds to favour one version above the others, I\\'ve been forced to eat my words. The gameplay is essentially the same as before, which is nothing bad. Your objective as Sam Fisher is to sneak into enemy territory and accomplish your mission without being seen if the mission calls for it. It took a while for me to notice, but this game does indeed look better on Xbox. Backgrounds are sharper, the lighting is much better, and guards actually talk and get frightened looks in their eyes (as opposed to the frozen talking masks they were in the GC version). However, while better looks are indeed nice, they don\\'t make a game. The controls have been left more-or-less untouched from the first two, with a few exceptions. For example, you have to hold down the White button and scroll through your arsenal to select your weapon, rather than just pressing a button on the D-pad. It\\'s really nothing to concern yourself with, though. Chaos Theory feels very complete in comparison to the first two. In Splinter Cell, the characters were introduced, and Sam accomplished Third Echelon\\'s maiden mission without fail.

Something that really makes the Xbox version of CT superior to the Cube version is the load times. When booting the game, the sequence is almost identical, but a lot shorter: Xbox load screen, Ubisoft logo, Dolby logo, CT title screen for 20 seconds, opening movie (which doesn\\'t seem to let me skip until about a minute into it), load profile (no time), load mission (no time), load progress (10 seconds), load level (10 seconds), load exact location (5 seconds). The biggest relief is during the missions, which are seamless from beginning to end, unlike the \"levels\" in the GC version. For example, on GC when you play the bank level, you start in the courtyard, then once inside, you must load three different wings, which each can take half a minute to load. On Xbox, there\\'s no loading time whatsoever, and that helps the game feel much more immersive. Another interesting thing about CT is also how the missions aren\\'t totally isolated from each other.

Instead of having to shoot one of those out and risk having a sentry hear you, you can merely disable the light or camera and sneak past, plus the OCP causes the malfunctioning item to emit enough noise to disguise your passing if an enemy is indeed nearby. Sound is also more important in this game, because now there is actually a small gauge for it to let you know how loud Sam is. The small square on the bar represents the allowed level of noise, and anything above the square increases the risk of you being heard. Another new feature is the EEV, which is a visor mode that allows you to view and find objects that you can interact with, such as a computer, light or microphone. You can access and hack objects from a distance with the EEV, and can toggle all your different visors as well. Even though I don\\'t play online, I can easily enjoy the two-player co-op mode. Having two players cooperating can be fun, but as it really turns out, if your partner doesn\\'t screw up, you will; some of these levels can be very unforgiving. There are only a few co-op levels, but they are fun just the same, and it\\'s interesting to see the kind of objectives that would require two agents instead of just one. Is Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory a good game? Yes. Better visuals, easier controls and much shorter loading times give the Xbox version the edge over the GC version. If you have any interest in action games, there shouldn\\'t be too much reason why you haven\\'t tried this game already. Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is the Splinter Cell game we\\'ve all been waiting for. Find this game, pop it into your system and get ready to have fun.',\n",

       "  {'deck': 'All these years later, Pokémon still works',\n",
       "   'description': 'It\\'s hard to believe that Pokémon has been around for as long as it has. Memories of everyone I know caught up with Red and Blue, talking about their collections, tricking each other into trading for bad creatures and singing the Pokérap are just a few choice bits. It was slightly embarrassing (we were all 13 to 15 then), but we didn\\'t care. I even went as far as buying the 2.B.A. Master CD and the special Pokémon Yellow Game Boy Color. We eventually grew out of it, though; I don\\'t think a single one of us ever owned Gold or Silver, although I still played through both. And now, seven years later, for reasons that escape me, I decided to dive back into the world I once knew with Pokémon Emerald, and I have not been disappointed. Leaving Indigo and Johto behind, Emerald takes place in the disconnected Hoenn region and naturally has dozens of new fuzzy Pokémon to behold, some familiar to my eyes, some totally foreign, but all welcome sights. Red and Blue were large enough with 150 Pokémon, and then Gold and Silver added another hundred, and from what I\\'ve read, Ruby and Sapphire brought the total to 386. While they aren\\'t all in one game, you can rest assured that such a large number guarantee that you\\'ll never be bored with this game. Just like Yellow and Crystal were before it, Pokémon Emerald is a \"director\\'s cut\" of sorts. From what I\\'ve seen of Ruby and Sapphire, Emerald touches them up slightly with things like a new typeface for the text, some different Pokémon animations, and other things of the sort. Then again, everything in this game looks great to my sore eyes. Anything would after so many years away. Of course, at its core, Emerald is still about catchin\\' \\'em all. Your character (you can choose between Brendan and May, I took May) just moved to the area, and the local Pokémon doc Professor Birch takes a liking to you, as does his grandchild, the character you didn\\'t select who ends up becoming your rival, who for the first time isn\\'t a jerk. Right away, this game felt very familiar, from the choosing of a grass, fire or water type at the beginning, to having to get through a forest early, to fighting a gym leader with rock-type Pokémon. However, despite its simplicity, it still feels just as bloody rewarding when you finally best a trainer or gym leader who gets to you, whether it\\'s because you can\\'t figure out a Pokémon\\'s weakness, the Pokémon puts yours to sleep and it refuses to wake up, or the opposing trainer uses a Hyper Potion on his or her Pokémon when it has only one hit point left; the taste of victory was so close, and then BAM! All these years later, and it\\'s still exhilarating. As it has been in the past, there\\'s enough story to keep you going. Even though it gets weak in a few places, it suffices in keeping you going. Whether it\\'s because you strive to be better than you father (who\\'s one of the more annoying gym leaders), because you have to stop opposing gangs Aqua and Magma from destroying the world (by either flooding it or turning it all to land, both so Pokémon can live more freely), or because you have to show those higher up that the small-town person can always make it in the big leagues, there\\'s always a way to connect with that little character sprite on the GBA screen. I won\\'t deny it, I missed Pokémon. It stunned me when I bought this game that the show was still on TV, that the card game was still being made, and that the games were still selling well. The last things I remember before leaving my own personal Pokéworld were Ash leaving Charizard with the other Charizards, the ridiculously fun Karaokemon songs (which I ended up tracking down to play to this game), and the sad fact that YTV shuffled its schedule so I couldn\\'t really watch it anymore, which essentially phased Pokémon out of my life altogether. Those were great \"late childhood\" memories, and they all started with the remarkably simple and enjoyable Game Boy games. You would strive to be better than every one, to raise the strongest Pokémon, to catch \\'em all. All these years later, Pokémon Emerald proves that the formula I fell in love with years ago still works, and it\\'s still enjoyable.',\n",

       "   'description': \"I was weaned on games in the 16-bit era, and the few games I played will always stick in my head and have a place in my heart. I was a SNES fan but I always liked a few games on the Sega Genesis, especially the Sonic the Hedgehog games, and I'd always make good on the few chances I got to play any of them. About a decade later, after many shifts in the video game landscape, Sega packed numerous Sonic games together and the resulting Sonic Mega Collection is a both a fantastic piece of nostalgia and a collection of some games that still hold up rather well today. Playing all of these old Sega Genesis games does not feel as strange on the GameCube controller as one might think. You can use either the stick or the D-pad to move Sonic directionally. He can still move left and right, and down still makes him spin. The A-button, B-button and X-button are mapped as the Genesis’ A-B-C respectively and all used for jumping in the majority of the games. The most important part is that is doesn’t feel wrong. I remember the Genesis controller feeling awfully large for it’s time, but the Cube controller is around the same size and feels comfortable to play with. If you’re a former Sega purist and feel wrong and icky about playing Sonic on a Nintendo system, the controls should make you feel right at home. There are 7 games available at the start. They are Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic 2, Sonic 3, Sonic & Knuckles, Sonic 3D Blast, Sonic Spinball, and Dr. Robotnik’s Mean Bean Machine. The only reason I bought this game was because it has Sonic the Hedgehog 2 on it; that was all I wanted or cared about. Sonic 2 was the Sonic game that made me fall in love with Sonic. All these years later it is still fun to play. The basic premise of the first Sonic games was to run from one end of the stage to the other while collecting rings, bouncing on enemies and avoiding spikes that pop out of the ground for no reason, and all while going faster than you can even keep your eye on. Sonic the Hedgehog 1 is almost as good as Sonic 2. The game is just as fun, the music is just as catchy and the speed is just as eye-rippling, but the absence of the spin-dash is often quite glaring. I know that's not the game's fault, but after so much Sonic 2 one does get used to it and so when I try to spin-dash up a wall and Sonic just curls up and jumps, after a while it gets annoying. The rest of the games are a mixed bag. Sonic 3 plays much like 1 and 2, but there are a number of oddities that make it my least favourite of the original trilogy. Sonic 3 was the first stop in Sonic’s eventual downfall, because Sega took out some of the elements of speed and replaced it with puzzles that just don’t fit, maybe to make Sonic more like other games at the time rather than continuing to forge their own path. The new character Knuckles was cool at the time, but again, it signaled the beginning of the over-emphasis on all of Sonic’s friends and shifted focus away from Sonic and speed, the two things that made the first two games so memorable. Sonic & Knuckles, the direct sequel to Sonic 3, has the same problems, but that isn’t to say they are both bad games. No, rather they just don’t shine as brightly next to their two predecessors.  And then you have the weird additions that may or may not have been included just to fill a quota. Sonic 3D Blast, as experimental, ahead of its time and oddly-controlling as it may be, is probably the best of the remaining games. It felt strange to play on the Genesis, but on the GameCube controller with a control stick it feels much better. Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine was Puyo Puyo until it had the Sonic moniker slapped on it to make it more marketable, but it is a fun puzzle game that shouldn’t be overlooked. Sonic Spinball is another situation of Sonic being put in a game he doesn’t really belong in, but it’s no slouch and a decent pinball game. These games are there and they’re fun to play so play them. In addition to the seven games available from the start, there are five unlockable games: Flicky, Ristar, Blue Sphere, Knuckles in Sonic 2 and Sonic 3 & Knuckles. Flicky is a 1984 arcade game in which you rescue tiny birds, and it seems to be aimed at 3-year-olds. Blue Sphere is the Sonic bonus mini-game that requires you to touch all the blue spheres on a grid without touching any red ones. Ristar is a fun late-life-cycle Genesis platformer that I had never played until unlocking it. Ristar is a humanoid star with extendable arms that help him on his journey to save the solar system from the grasp of the evil Kaiser Greedy. It’s pretty fun. And Sega would have been nuts to include Sonic & Knuckles and not its most awesome feature: to play as Knuckles in Sonic 2 and 3. To play “Sonic 3 & Knuckles” back in the day wasn’t a big deal because Sonic & Knuckles essentially does that already, but “Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog 2” was absolutely mind-blowing at the time and still is. The idea that you could patch Knuckles into an existing game and have it work was too much for my little pre-teen mind to handle. Playing as Knuckles in Sonic 2 is almost as much fun as regular Sonic 2. There are a few gameplay differences, such as Knuckles’ ability to glide and clutch walls remaining intact and the fact that your ring count remains intact if you enter and return from a special stage. The extras are hardly worth a mention, but they’re still there. In addition to the unlockable games, there are several other things on the disc that fall under “I didn’t want them but I’ll look anyway.” There are manuals for all included games, official character art, dozens of comic book covers and several trailers and video clips. Nothing too mind-blowing; the manuals are the most interesting of this bunch. All the games run perfectly, which is something that shouldn’t have been too difficult on the GameCube hardware but is still commendable. Save for the fact that you can press the Z-button to return to the game-select menu, you will actually think you are playing the Sega Genesis when you look at all the games in the collection. If you’re having trouble keeping up with Sonic that isn’t the system’s fault; Sonic was so fast the Genesis almost couldn’t handle him. Also, the replayability in this collection is a no-brainer; in a collection of twelve games you are bound to find a few you like and can bounce between. Overall, Sonic Mega Collection is a very competent compilation. It puts twelve games of varying quality onto one disc, which is a bargain no one can argue against. It gives younger gamers a chance to see Sonic’s beginnings, and older gamers a chance to replay the games from their childhood memories and to (arguably) see Sonic at his peak. Do yourself a favor: go out there and find the Sonic Mega Collection, because you will not regret it if you do.\",\n",

       "  {'deck': 'God of War II improves on the first game & delivers on all levels',\n",
       "   'description': 'God of War II is an incredible example of improving on the first game while not drastically altering gameplay in any major way. The main gameplay elements of visceral combat and challenging-but-not-difficult puzzle solving are just as present as before, but the fact that they feel so much better than the first game make God of War II a game for the ages. GoW II picks up from the end of the first game: you are Kratos, the ashen-white, bloodthirsty Spartan warrior who has recently deposed Olympian god Ares to become the God of War. The main story involves Kratos\\' tactics becoming so brutal that the Olympian gods send him back to earth as a mortal again, trick him into giving up his godly powers and almost send him into Hades. Showing up to save Kratos is the titan Gaia, who then informs Kratos that he must seek out the destiny-controlling Sisters of Fate, a feat no mortal has ever come close to accomplishing. If you played the first God of War, the premise should seem similar in that Kratos must journey further and achieve something more difficult than anyone before him, while along the way encountering many characters and creatures from Greek mythology. And how do you manage to do this? By destroying, maiming and tearing apart everything that moves! The combat remains almost identical to that of the first game. You press X and Triangle to use Kratos\\' chain-blades and other weapons, but when enemies swarm upon you constantly you can mash buttons for only so long before you have to start learning how to avoid attack patterns and use numerous combos. But for all the things that remain the same, much has changed in God of War II. One addition to GoW II is the presence of sub-weapons, either a giant hammer or large spear, that Kratos can use instead of his Blades of Athena, but much like the previous game you\\'ll pretty much only need the blades and nothing else. There are also new spells this time around, with long-range attack Typhon\\'s Bane (renamed from Zeus\\' Fury) and enemy-freezing Head of Euryale (renamed from Medusa\\'s Gaze) being joined by Cronos\\' Rage, a multi-targeting electric attack that will likely be your most-used magic attack, and Atlas Quake, a wide-area ground-pounding attack. The Rage of the Gods also returns as Rage of the Titans and works the same by pressing L3 + R3, except that you can manually stop using it before your meter drains. Kratos can also use a hookshot-type item to swing from certain areas using the R1 button as well as being able to fly (glide, actually) later in the game. The button-mashing-in-correct-sequence quicktime events return, and ripping out a cyclops\\' eye or a medusa\\'s head feels just that much more satisfying after hitting a four-button, two-stick combo. There is one place they\\'re even more welcome: opening doors. In God of War, you had to mash R1 to open a door, but in GoW II you have to press R1 and then mash O repeatedly, which is much easier on the hands but can still get extremely annoying when there is an army of skeletons trying to kill you as the spiked roof not-so-slowly collapses upon your head. The other little changes that were made were for the better: you can press X to have Kratos move up ladders now in addition to walls, you can jump down walls as well as up, blocking an enemy\\'s attack with L1 can send the attack back at said enemy if timed right (which comes in extremely handy in later boss battles), and in certain areas you can even stop time for a few seconds, with your time left being shown as a yellow bar below your green health meter and blue magic meter, replacing the red \"orb count\" meter. You still collect a ludicrous amount of red orbs to upgrade your weapons and spells, though; I got so many from enemies and chests that all spells and but one weapon were at max level by the final battle. One completely new element in GoW II are the two flight sections early in the game in which Kratos pilots a Pegasus in his journey to the Isle of Fates. Neither lasts too long, but long enough for you to have to fight airborne enemies, dodge fire in slow motion and jump onto an enemy gryphon and quicktime-event particular annoying enemies, all while careening through the darkened sky, and also while avoiding stalactites and beams in the cavern level. For a PS2 game, God of War II looks absolutely insane. Sony\\'s Santa Monica studio completely tapped the well dry with this game: the varying environments from the snowy mountains and titanic caves to decrepit swamps and sweltering volcanoes are mouth-gapingly gorgeous, and the game isn\\'t afraid to zoom in on the architecture, enemies and characters because they can stand up to very close scrutiny and still look remarkable. Even that there are no load screens save for two or three is amazing because even the hallways Kratos has to run down to disguise them look amazing. The art direction and amount of polish in GoW II is second to none. Overall, GoW II delivers on all levels. It contains all the things people play games for: gruesomely satisfying combat, simple yet ingenious puzzles, an engaging story and the desire to keep going because everything is just so good. And the best part is that there\\'s so much of it: depending on how much exploring and fighting your do, the game could last from nine to twelve hours the first time through, and there are numerous unlockables and extra modes after the game\\'s completion. There\\'s even a bonus DVD that chronicles the making of the game, and contains many things from interviews and behind-the-scenes meetings to looks at lost levels and voice recording sessions, just to name a few. Whether or not you played the first game, or whether or not you even own a Playstation 2, you absolutely owe it to yourself to play God of War II because it truly is a quintessential video game and should not be missed.',\n",

       "   'description': 'When I first saw Guitar Hero on the PS2 in late \\'05, I was intrigued. When at last the time came for me to own a PlayStation 2 Guitar Hero was the first thing I thought of. When I finally found it and popped it into my system, I could not have been more satisfied, because Guitar Hero is an awesome game and a blast to play. To be frank, this game rocks. I\\'ve played other rhythm games before (long ago), but GH\\'s custom-shaped controller makes all the difference in the world. If you’ve never seen the controller, it’s shaped just like a real electric guitar but smaller in size. The neck has five colored fret buttons; green, red, yellow, blue and orange. To actually play notes, you hold down the corresponding color fret button and “strum” on the click-flipper that fills in for the strings. For those of you who would like to get more immersed in the guitar-playing fantasy, there is even a whammy bar that can warble longer notes (and increase you Star Power meter, but more on that later). It takes some getting used to, but after a little practice you\\'ll be hitting the fret buttons like it was second nature.  There\\'s no real \"story,\" but what passes for one is that you (the character you select at the beginning and can change whenever) are an up-and-coming guitarist making your way up the ladder on the local music circuit. That\\'s where the game really stops caring because that\\'s where you should stop caring. Guitar Hero is about the music and there\\'s plenty of it. There are up to 30 songs in Career mode (only 25 in Easy, Medium and up get all 30) with another 17 unlockable songs you can buy with in-game money. You can get a score of 3 to 5 stars in a song, and depending on how well you play a song you\\'re given money which you can then spend on new songs, new characters, new guitars and other things. How well you play a song is graded on things like longest note streak and average score multiplier throughout the song, but also heavily on your final score. For a multiplier, hit ten notes in a row to have notes double in value from 50 to 100 (x2), then another ten for 100 to 150 (x3), and finally another ten for 150 to 200 (x4). But remember, you have to actually finish the song! You can\\'t just play terribly and get away with it, for you will be punished (with the crowd booing and your amp giving you horrible feedback, for example). This is where Star Power comes in. Star Power is earned by playing enough star-shaped notes throughout the song to fill up a blue bar on the right of the screen above your odometer-like “Rock Meter”. Depending on how well you are playing your Rock Meter will be in Red, Yellow or Green. When you\\'re in the Green, you\\'re hitting most notes and the crowd loves you, but mess up enough to get down to Yellow and then Red and the crowd may become hostile. Once your Star Power meter is full enough you can tilt the guitar to point up (or press Select if you\\'re fast enough) and all notes will glow blue, doubling your score multiplier (up to x8, or 400 points per note) and (important for a hard song) the crowd will start loving you if you hit enough notes, which is important because the crowd’s love dictates whether or not you will even pass the song. Now I noted earlier that your whammy bar helps you with Star Power, so let’s delve into that. There are two types of notes, short and long. Short notes are most common; you just press the fret and strum quickly to play these ones. But for long notes you have to press the fret, click the strum and continue holding the fret button(s) until the note is over (not the strum, just the fret). If a long note is star-shaped, you can hold the fret(s) down and then start flicking your whammy bar to boost up your Star Power faster than if you were just doing it normally. Not only does this help with playing, but as was stated earlier it also helps immerse you in the fantasy and dream that you’re actually playing guitar and the crowd actually loves you. The line blurs but it’s incredibly satisfying. But the heart of this game is the awesome soundtrack. There are 30 songs split into 6 groups of 5 songs each, and considering that it’s safe to assume that most people who pick up this game will have little-to-no guitar playing experience the designers made a lot of the music recognizable. The first two set lists are filled with songs that, if you\\'ve ever picked up a broom and \"jammed\" to a song you were listening to, odds are a couple of those times you were listening to one of these songs. “I Love Rock ‘n’ Roll,” “More Than a Feeling,” “Smoke on the Water” and “Iron Man” are all staples of the hockey-stick playing air guitarist and they’re incredible to play. However, you aren’t actually listening to Joan Jett, Boston or Deep Purple, but rather RedOctane and Harmonix cover bands. For the most part they do a very good job. They play the music extremely well and even make a couple of changes here and there, just by adding a few notes to keep you on your feet. The changes they make are mostly to prevent fade-outs because too many of those are just no fun. The singers are also mostly competent. Symphony of Destruction obviously isn’t sung by Dave Mustaine but is well-sung nonetheless, while the cover of Iron Man is nearly\\xa0spot-on with the real Ozzy Osbourne. Some songs sound better than their originals while others just sound horrible, but that’s just to my ears. It’s all a matter of perspective. The mixture of music is one that looks strange on paper, but actually works pretty well in-game. You start by playing classic rock songs from Black Sabbath, Boston and Queen and throw in some harder stuff like Judas Priest and Blue Öyster Cult, but then all of a sudden you’re playing much more recent stuff like Franz Ferdinand, Sum 41 and The Donnas. It seems to be that the less you actually know about music the more fun you’ll have, because the oddity of playing “Take Me Out” right after “You’ve Got Another Thing Comin’” and\\xa0 “Fat Lip” after “Ziggy Stardust” is non-existent if you don’t know any different (or don’t care). While their eras might be completely off, they meld together very well because they’re all fun to play and all sound as if, in some alternate universe, they would go side by side. While single player will give you enough to last for months, multiplayer adds even more replayability to Guitar Hero. If you have a friend with another guitar controller the multiplayer modes open up and you can play against each other in a cooperative face-off. The multiplayer mode has a meter in the middle of the screen that actually keeps track of who is “winning,” which is odd because each player plays different notes at different paces. Sometimes one player will play a lengthy solo while the other just stands there waiting. But don’t let the odd placement of “winning” and “losing” in this mode take away the fun you can have with it. Overall, Guitar Hero is an astounding accomplishment. To be able to make a rhythm/music game that\\xa0almost anyone\\xa0can play with relative ease and enjoy is nothing if not remarkable. This game comes wholeheartedly recommended. Buy it, rent it, borrow it or just monopolize the demo station at Best Buy because Guitar Hero is one of the most fun games to come along in a long, long time.',\n",

However, to immerse you in the fantasy of playing in a band the game does a very good job of creating atmosphere.

If a long note is star-shaped, you can hold the fret(s) down and then start flicking your whammy bar to boost up your Star Power faster than if you were just doing it normally. Not only does this help with playing, but as was stated earlier it also helps immerse you in the fantasy and dream that you’re actually playing guitar in concert and the crowd actually loves you. The line blurs and it’s incredibly satisfying. But the heart of this game is the awesome soundtrack. There are 40 songs split into 8 groups of 5 songs each once they are all unlocked, and considering that it’s safe to assume that most people who pick up this game will have little-to-no guitar playing experience the designers made a lot of the music recognizable. I wasn’t as familiar with the songs in the initial setlists as I was with the original Guitar Hero’s songs, but there were numerous recognizable tunes mixed with long-forgotten tracks such as Van Halen’s “You Really Got Me,” The Police’s “Message in a Bottle” and Mötley Crüe’s “Shout at the Devil.” While I wasn’t as familiar with the initial songs, the progression through Career Mode and unlocking the rest of the setlists came with some very cool surprises. And of course, once again these songs are sung by cover artists from RedOctane and Harmonix, and once again it’s up to you to decide whether or not the singers and musicians are competent. No one else in the world sounds exactly like the singers in question, but the cover bands come as close as possible to sounding like Ozzy Osbourne, Axl Rose, Dave Grohl, the Wilson sisters, Zack de la Rocha and others. Heck, the producers were even lucky enough to get Primus and Jane’s Addiction to let them use the master tracks of “John the Fisherman” and “Stop!” But there are always a few bumps. Whoever stood in for Avenged Sevenfold’s M. Shadows does an honorable job but just can’t sing in the same harsh, guttural way, while the singer who impersonates Glen Danzig seems to be trying to cover up a European accent. But don’t worry, because these are things you’ll only notice after playing a few times. And as I said with the original Guitar Hero, the less in-depth knowledge you have about music, the more fun you’ll probably have because you’ll just hear the music and have fun with it without hearing all the things “wrong” with it. But this is Guitar Hero II, not Guitar Hero I: The Expansion and so there are a number of new and different things that make it better than the original while keeping the same core gameplay intact. For starters, there is more incentive to keep getting better if you’re not that good. Easy mode only allows you to unlock the first seven setlists and only the first four songs in each. If you can manage to work your way up to Medium, after you play the final listed song in a set the camera will pan out, and crowd will go wild and call you back for an encore. The encore song is generally the most difficult song in the set but is also the most fun because of the energy the on-screen audience has. (When you hit the stage again and the curtain re-opens they are so frenzied that your Rock Meter will start in the green instead of the yellow.) You’ll also probably be exhausted if you managed to just play your way through the first four songs only for this one to come along, but that nervous energy makes it even more fun. And of course, more songs are always better and you can’t argue against playing songs like Kansas’ “Carry On Wayward Son,” Guns N’ Roses “Sweet Child O’ Mine,” Rush’s “YYZ” and Lynard Skynard’s “Free Bird.” In Guitar Hero II, hammer-ons and pull-offs are easier. If you don’t know what those are, a hammer-on is pressing multiple ascending fret buttons and playing successful notes with just one click of the strum bar. A pull-off is the opposite; you hold all the fret buttons you need and let go of them in descending order to play notes with just one strum. These two techniques are how people seem to be able to play notes faster than humanly possible and they’re pretty much required once you start playing Hard and Expert difficulties. In Guitar Hero the window to pull these off was incredibly small. They were difficult to hit just in the original game’s Tutorial mode. In GHII the window for hammer-ons and pull-offs is increased sufficiently that you’ll hit them without even realizing it, and just having to strum once while playing a relentless passage during a fast and/or tricky song can be a lifesaver. Another new addition is Practice Mode. In addition to the Quick-Play mode from the first game you can now choose to play just a section of a song you’ve been having trouble with instead of playing the entire song just to get to the problem part. This is especially great because Guitar Hero II is a good deal harder than the original once you reach the higher songs and higher difficulties. I swear, a number of these songs probably would be easier on a real guitar, especially now that the all-new three-button chord is introduced in Hard mode. But challenging difficulty aside, the biggest addition to GHII is the expanded multiplayer modes. The biggest change here is that each player can select his or her own difficulty, so if you’re pretty good on Hard but your friend is still terrified of the blue button he can play on Easy while you stick to Hard. Guitar Hero I’s multiplayer returns here as “Face-Off,” in which players trade notes back and forth. There is also Cooperative mode in which players share a score, Star Power meter and note streak and in which one player takes lead guitar while the other takes bass guitar or rhythm and you both play a fuller song than in the single-player mode. And once you finish the game you unlock Pro Face-Off, in which both players each play the same notes at the same time and the question of who is better at a given song can finally be answered amongst yourselves. Get some people together and you will have nothing but a blast with this mode. Overall, Guitar Hero II is an astounding accomplishment and even manages to top its predecessor. To be able to make a rhythm/music game that almost anyone\\xa0can play with relative ease and enjoy is nothing if not remarkable. It’s also one of the only games I can think of that is as much fun to watch being played as it is to actually play. This game comes wholeheartedly recommended. Buy it, rent it, borrow it or just monopolize the demo station at Best Buy because Guitar Hero II is one of the most fun games to come along in a long, long time.',\n",

       "  {'deck': 'Awesome for 24 fans, but the \"game\" part doesn\\'t really work',\n",
       "   'description': 'It’s kind of a stretch to call 24: The Game a “game” because that is not the reason that anyone has played it. As a piece of the 24 universe it is meant to fill in some gaps and tie up some loose threads between seasons 2 and 3 of the show, and to that end it does a respectable job. Several threads from the end of Day 2 that were either hardly addressed or not explained at all in Day 3 have lots of light shed on them. However, as a video game for the Sony PlayStation 2 game console it’s really a paint-by-numbers game that gets too ambitious for its own good and consequently falls on its face. The TV show of 24 is rife with material from which to create a game; it has action, interesting characters (both good and bad), numerous and insane plot twists and the ever-growing suspense that comes with its ticking clock. You can play as several characters from the show including Jack, Chase, Tony and Kim (along with many other non-playable characters from the series) who look pretty amazing. Every actor from the series has lent their likeness (and most voices as well) to this game to make it feel totally authentic and in that regard it does not fail. Furthermore, actual writers from the show penned the game’s story, so that early-seasons feel is pretty much cemented. And no, this game doesn’t take 24 hours to complete; it’s more along the lines of 10 hours. There are three primary modes of play; third-person action (shooting hordes of enemies and stealthily sneaking around), mini-game puzzle solving (hacking into computers and electronic door locks) and driving missions. We’ll start with the third-person action because it does take up the bulk of the game, but it also has its own bulk of ups and downs. The basic controls are the left stick to move, L1 to target an enemy and R1 to fire your gun. There’s also a “cover” system in 24: The Game and it works pretty well in small fights; simply press X behind something large enough to hide behind such as a stack of crates or a wall to have Jack put his back to the wall. Pressing L1 while in cover will have him peer out to see if any enemies are around and target them if any are, at which point you may open fire at will. It’s once we get past these “basic” controls that problems start cropping up. For starters, if there are two or more enemies that Jack can aim at, the camera will almost always auto-aim at the wrong one whether it be the one farthest away, the one not shooting at you or the unarmed one you shouldn’t shoot at all. Pressing left or right on the left thumbstick will change targets but you have to press hard or it won’t always work. The fun that third-person shooting offers is all the weapons you can choose from; pistols, shotguns, automatic weapons, better automatic weapons and a good old punch in the face if you need to. You can take weapons and ammo from any of the dead henchmen you come across by pressing Square while standing over them. 24: The Game even has an option to auto-equip the best weapon in your arsenal, so if you find yourself running low on 9mm ammo for your pistol and you search a body only for more enemies to come running at you, you may find yourself suddenly firing your new Soviet rifle at them. The thing is you will have dead henchmen left and right to pick ammo from because the enemy AI is incredibly stupid; they either don’t shoot back or have a cover pattern that makes them easily hittable. If you stand far enough away you can simply take cover and mow down a dozen enemies before any of them can get a good shot off at you. This only appears to be a problem from a pure gameplay stance, but as a 24 fan I can excuse it because in its own strange way the game is actually keeping with the way the show unfolds; Jack against an army of ten terrorists with automatic weapons, and all he needs is his 9mm, 15-shot pistol to take out nine of them and then kill the tenth with his bare hands and maybe a nearby chain. However, while everything is peachy from far away, once you get in close you will wonder if you’re playing a finished game. If you’re confronting more than one enemy up close the L1 aiming system will be shot to hell with the camera spastically jumping around everywhere except at the guy who’s filling you with of bullets or repeatedly punching you in the head, and by the time you either manage to look at the enemy or run away your life will almost be completely depleted. This incredible annoyance will cause you to twitch with anger, so if you can, avoid any close combat and invert the controls if you have to. Speaking of needing patience, there are some rather lengthy driving missions, and unfortunately they are the least fun part of the game because every vehicle you can control in this game handles absolutely atrociously. It feels like you’re driving on ice with bald tires and you’re actually controlling a piece of wood. Every mission involves either you chasing a villain or you getting chased and rammed by several enemy vehicles, and if the controls weren’t so bad these missions would actually be fun; suddenly reversing, swerving about and even losing your pursuers by forcing them to crash into oncoming traffic is some level of fun, but the fact of the matter is that you will almost always need to play a driving mission at least twice to actually pass it, and some of the ones later in the game require even more patience. Luckily every mission, if lengthy enough, has auto-save checkpoints that will keep you from having to start all over if you fail a mission, and you will when driving. Puzzle solving comes in both stand-alone missions and as requirements in the middle of third-person missions. The most fun “puzzle” is interrogating a suspect who refuses to give up necessary information. Jack or Tony will have the suspect restrained and you must utilize their powers of persuasion to extract what you need within a time limit, usually about four and a half minutes. Using Triangle for aggressive, Square for neutral and X for calm you must get the suspect’s heart rate within the “cooperation line” several times to progress. Every time a question is answered a green bar will fill up on the side of the screen, but if the suspect gets too calm or too panicked you will have to press Triangle or X numerous times to get the heart rate back in range, and once you get close to the end the sweet spot will move around, making it difficult to hit. The gameplay is fun and it’s funny to hear the suspect get more and more panicked, but if anything is off in this mini-game it’s the audio. Jack may go from yelling death threats to being calmly threatening to simply trying to soothe the suspect’s nerves all in a span of twenty seconds, and while this does fit with the objective of the game it just kills a lot of the tension (at least, until you look at the ticking clock in the corner again). The other puzzle-based missions are fairly straightforward and simple. You have to rearrange red letters in a certain order until they turn green to crack electric locks, which comes up quite a bit and can’t help but feel too easy. Another one has you use the four face buttons to trace the correct path to two cubes (nodes) to unlock a door, (if you just sit at the beginning and take a few seconds to plan your path there’s really no challenge involved here), and there’s a hacking puzzle in which you have to partition a hard drive by ever-more-quickly matching the face buttons with the corresponding colored sections. One last one reminds me of the lock picking from Splinter Cell: you have to locate the sites of 10 bombs in a given area and you must rotate and swivel the left thumbstick precisely to find them and then stick with that exact spot for a few seconds to let it lock on, much like finding the sweet spot and jiggling in that area to pick locks as Sam Fisher. And it’s that comparison to Splinter Cell that brings me full circle to what really plagues this game overall, which is that it just tries too damn hard to be too many different things and can’t pull any of it off successfully. It has third-person action like Resident Evil 4, driving and stealing cars like GTA, stealth like Splinter Cell and puzzles like something from a Touch Generations DS game. And how do you mesh all of these genres and modes of gameplay into one coherent game? I don’t know, because this game isn’t it. And furthermore, there are some large gaps of time and logic that the game makes no effort to explain. On the show there can be two or three concurrent storylines in one episode, yet in the game you almost have the exact opposite, one storyline that takes three hours. Also, on the show you often see the bad guys’ point of view and get some sort of understanding of what they’re doing, but in the game other than when the good guys are around you really don’t hear anything about their true objectives or true motives. This can be forgiven because this is a game, but even so that left me feeling down.  For the true 24 nut, all missions have “objectives” that help you unlock bonus content at the end of each mission. Character profiles and actor interviews make up the bulk of the unlockables that you can get if you achieve a grade of 90% or above in any of the 58 separate missions. The grades you get depend on several factors the game tracks and displays at the end of the missions. You can get bonus points for speed, accuracy, number of head shots, number of civilians rescued and more, while you get points subtracted for civilians harmed, vehicle damage, inaccuracy or taking too much time. The grading system is meant to encourage replaying the game, and for the action-focused missions such as storming buildings and rescuing people it works, but you have to be either incredibly hardcore or a masochist to want to do some of these driving missions again just to unlock a model of “Madsen’s Bodyguard #3.” In the end, 24: The Game feels like an opportunity that wasn’t fully cashed in on. It packs much of what is great about the TV show into a game but also leaves you inexcusably hanging and scratching your head at many points. I recently acquired all five available seasons of the show on DVD, and after watching through the first two seasons I played this game, and it would take a fellow 24 fan that would do the same thing to really tolerate and maybe even enjoy 24: The Game. Otherwise, you’re better off renting it or just staying away.',\n",

       "   'description': 'Neversoft is not Harmonix. That is obvious. However, this does not mean Neversoft can not make a great music game. I mean, even veterans like Harmonix had to start somewhere. That being said, Guitar Hero III is not a encouraging first effort from the rhythm virgins at Neversoft.  While all the key components seem there: decent songs, notes, and a good guitar controller. The problem is that the game just falls apart after that. The timing window of the game is botched: while some complain about the easy nature of the Rock Band guitar note charts, the timing window on GHIII makes should be impossible solos a breeze for Guitar Hero veterans like me. Neversoft attempts to balance this out with an overflow of three button chords and awkward charts. This does not work to the songs benefit. Songs like Before I forget and 3s & 7s are completely misrepresented in the game and this type of charting make songs that should be enjoyable, not much harder, but completely awkward and just plain frustrating to play.\\xa0Even the easier songs like Barracuda and Sunshine of Your Love are just plain dull to play. This is probably just song selection, but even the easiest songs to play in Guitar Hero II were a blast. From tier one through eight, Guitar Hero II was fun to play, no matter how much you actually enjoyed the song... and while GHIII ditches some lame covers, the pure joy of playing a toy guitar is nearly sucked away from the game, and replaced with five tiers that are a bore to play and the final three tiers of mostly poorly charted songs and missed opportunities. The entire soundtrack isnt a failure though. Songs like My Name is Jonas, Cult of Personality, and One capture the joy of the Guitar Hero gameplay we know and love which is to far and in between in the game. The failures of the game isn\\'t all in the guitar gameplay: Boss battles are a horrendous and bland entry into the series. While playing against Slash and Tom Morello sounds like a good idea, the Battle Mode used in these battles are not fun experiences, but awkward and pointless events in which you save a \"weapon\" for the guitar foe\\'s hardest solo.The art design also leaves a lot to be desired. Characters that were goofy fun in the first two Guitar Hero games mostly come off as disturbing attempts to make fun cartoon characters realistic or \"sexy\" much like that weird artist that draws real life pictures of Homer Simpson and Mario. All in all, GHIII is a discouraging attempt by Neversoft to bottle the series flame when it was already carried by the original developers to \"the other music game\". I really hope Neversoft can recapture the series\\' former strengths, because the strong brand that was Guitar Hero is diminishing quickly over time',\n",

       "   'description': \"Dead Rising was the first game I picked up for the 360, actually it was the reason i bought a 360. Being trapped in a mall with thousands of zombies and countless items to violently kill them with? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! The concept made 'Dawn of the Dead' great, and it didn't disappoint in Dead Rising either. I actually knowingly bought it less than a week before the price drop and those extra few days were well worth the lack of restraint. GOOD STUFF: Zombies- Zombies are awesome. And there are an ass-ton of them.Leveling system- The leveling system is great. It adds to the replay value and, if you get good enough, you can go barehanded and rarely get touched by the undead shoppers, all the while doing wrestling moves and disemboweling. Good stuff.Save system- The save system has been endlessly criticized because you only have one save slot. The difficulty that it adds starting out only makes the game that much better in my opinion. Later on, it hardly matters, because Frank (your playable character) pretty much becomes Ash from Evil Dead and murders evil with ease.Chainsaws.Weapons other than chainsaws - One of the greatest experiences in life is killing a zombie with a bowling ball, or placing a traffic cone on his/her head and watching them stumble around, while you shoot them with a water gun or throw CD's at them.The bosses- You get to kill a deranged birthday clown and a psychotic grocery store manager.NOT SO GOOD STUFF:Achievements- A lot of people claim to ignore achievements. I believe that they are liars. Of course I can enjoy a game without having to get every single achievement, but it helps knowing that I could get them if I wanted. Most of the ones here are either pretty simple, or just time consuming. But there are two achievements that have no business in a video game. 5- Day Survivor and 7 Day Survivor. It consists of playing Survival mode and lasting 5 & 7 days. It sounds pretty simple, except that one game day equals two real hours, so that means playing 10-14 hours for them. And also... you can't save in Survival mode, so not only can you not die, but you have to complete the run at one time. That is stupid. I did it. Your prize: A laser sword and a pair of heart boxers.Otis- He is ass. He is a mall cop who calls you on the walkie-talkie with 'scoops'. (oh yeah, you're a reporter) The problem is that he seemingly calls you every 4 seconds, and if you're getting eaten alive by the 'hordes of hell' at the time, he will call back and give an attitude about the fact that you ignored him.\\xa0 He is an ass.All in all this is an amazing game and one of my favorites of all-time, even with a couple of minor gripes. I guess I should mention something about the plot, but it doesn't matter.\",\n",

       "   'description': '\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 One of the greatest aspects of the Nintendo DS is its versatility in terms of genres and the gameplay included in those genres, so you\\'re always able to find the newest and most innovative titles on the market for your awesome little handheld. Jam Sessions, developed by Plato, is like that in many ways. It combines a unique gameplay experience with a very accurate sound presentation that literally transforms your DS into an acoustic guitar. Unfortunately, Jam Sessions ultimately fails at providing this experience in an engaging way, and even the biggest guitar fanatics out there wont be able to find much to enjoy with this title. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So you want to be a rock star? Well this might not be the best place to start. Jam Sessions really isn\\'t a game, it\\'s essentially a handheld guitar application. The basic premise of the game is to slide your stylus up and down the screen in order to strum the guitar sting, all while you use your other hand to hit the chords on the D-pad. You can go into the settings and turn the lefty controls on; this just switches the fret buttons from the D-pad to the letter buttons. While this seems like a neat idea at first, the feeling quickly fades when you dig a little deeper and find out there isn\\'t much else to do. There is a tutorial, warm up, a song list which is rather lackluster, and free play. The song list ranges from Jimi Hendrix to Avril Lavigne, and comes with twenty songs in all. Not very impressive. But since this is more of a guitar simulator rather than a game, free play is where most of the value lies. This lets you play whatever you want, for as long as you want. Any musically inclined person could easily create their own songs note-by-note. There is also a built in recording feature that lets you record small segments to the game\\'s memory that you can play back at anytime. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 There isn\\'t much that needs to be said about the game\\'s visuals, because there really aren\\'t any. You see the string, the notes, and the background. The string animates nicely when struck, and emits a wave of vibrations that shows how long the note is going to last. There are a number of themes you can choose for the game, most of which look pretty cool, but other than that there\\'s nothing to write home about. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Aside from the game\\'s unique gameplay, the sound is its only saving grace. This virtual guitar sounds just like an actual acoustic guitar would, especially when you\\'re plugged into a good pair of headphones. There are some effects you can put on the guitar such as distortion and echoing, but these settings sound pretty bad and you\\'ll likely mess with them once or twice before forgetting they ever existed. Why mess with something that is good to begin with anyway? Needless to say, the sound in Jam Sessions is the single greatest aspect the game has to offer. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 As you probably could have guessed by now, Jam Sessions lacks the certain intangibles that are required to have a proper game, and by doing so hinders the game\\'s value in such a way that it\\'s probably not even worth your money. There is no score, no multiplayer, certainly no objective, and it\\'s just simply an uncoupling \"game\" plain and simple. What this game does best is serve as a below average acoustic guitar, and playing it over a real guitar is just silly. It\\'s a great place to begin your journey into guitar competence, but aside from that this game is most definitely a rent first. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Plato certainly has the idea and the direction, but when it\\'s all said and done, Jam Sessions for the DS is just not there yet. It provides an interesting outlet for your guitar needs, and it sounds really great in the process, but there just isn\\'t enough game here to keep anyone\\'s attention. As a whole, Jam Sessions doesn\\'t appeal to everyone, and only someone looking for a way to play an acoustic guitar without an actual acoustic guitar should even bother with this game.

       "   'description': \"Yes, it seems that another DS title slips under the radar for many gamers, save for only those dedicated tacticians and Final Fantasy fans. And to tell you the truth, its ok. This game borrows\\xa0 much from its predecessor: jobs, weapons, abilities, and enemies. The game is already to deep for any newbie to fully enjoy and veterans will feel a little ripped off even with its hundreds of missions.STORY: 3The story revolves around Luso, a mischievous boy who gets transferred to a fantasy land by way of a magical tome. Soon thereafter he joins a clan and completes various missions for townsfolk, all the while searching for a way back home. You meet some important characters whom aide you in your quest and a couple surprise characters make an appearance too. The story is severely lacking as the original. VISUALS & SOUND: 7The game is 2D with some neat 3D effects and character summons. The battlefields have an isometric camera and are vividly detailed and vibrant, although the sprites you control and the enemies you face are mostly all recycled and bare no graphical face lift from\\xa0 FFTA. Like I mentioned earlier scions, powerful creature dudes, appear once in a while and look freakin' sweet. They fill up both DS screens and unleash a flashy attack on the enemy. Some standard magical animations and attacks look nifty too. The sound is standard and cheerful, you'll tire of it quickly especially for how long this game is.GAMEPLAY: 7You move your characters on a grid map and usually have to defeat a certain amount of enemies. You characters can master different jobs such as soldier,\\xa0 mage, and archer. Each job has weapons you can equip your units with that allow your unit to perform special abilities. The abilities are wide and varied and mastering these abiiities lets you perform special attribute attacks like launching a fire spell or attacking twice in a row. Also the laws are easier on you, you get\\xa0 rewarded for not breaking them but if you do, you lose your reward and won't be able to revive a unit that dies in that current battle.\\xa0It's more of the same with a couple of additions such as new races and jobs.I believe this game is too easy. My characters would finish a mission and earn little to no experience making leveling up tedious. The missions were not very exciting and slow. I hardly ever had to perform any tactical genius in a mission to win. It's okay for what it is, but it gets tiring really quickly.LONGEVITY & REPLAY: 9The game length is variable you could physical do each mission or dispatch party memebers to do them and the game will sim those fights. But it's long no matter which route you choose. You wouldn't want to replay it. There's no incentive, its kinda of mindless menu mashing.OVERALL: 7It's a solid game play system that you'll get bored of eventually, but it's worth your money if you like turn-based strategy games.I also recommend Advance Wars and the new Fire Emblem coming out...there a lot faster and more fun.\",\n",

That's it.\\xa0 They tried to reproduce Gears Of War. Everything down to the controls. Whats so sad is that they ripped off Gears of War and still managed to make it bad. Now I that they have every right to make the game how they want. But If your gonna copy Gears, then at least do it right. I could not get into the single player story. I tried multiple times but I couldn't get myself to enjoy it. I always try to point out the good points in games, but I only found one this time, and graphics DO NOT make the game.MultiplayerOnce again, nothing special here. Good graphics, gameplay isn't intriguing, and doesn't add much to the replay value. I didn't spend enough time to be able to say a lot about the multiplayer, but it plays like the single player story and that's all i need to know.Overall, all I can say is if you are itching for some third-person action, just play through Gears again. Trust me, you'll have more fun doing that.\",\n",

       "   'description': 'Editor\\'s Note: I wrote this review a long time ago. I think it needs some polish. I still agree with everything I said, however the review itself isn\\'t that well written. I still think I bring out some good points though, so the review can still be helpful to those seeking advise.Harvest Moon: Magical Melody, the latest entry in the long running farm simulator series from Natsume, follows in the same footsteps as its predecessors. However, the game is still as fun as ever even though it doesn’t change the formula all too much. This time around it adds a bunch of new things that makes the fun last a lot longer and makes it more satisfying than all of the previous Harvest Moon games.  Without any back story, the game lets you pick a gender (which barely effects the gameplay) and then sends you off to Flower Bud Village. There\\'s an \"Exciting Ranch Plan\" there that draws you over. Once you\\'re there the mayor lets you choose which plot of land you want to start off with, and then you start off your farming life.  When you get back home, some Harvest Sprites, creatures that look like a mix between Gnomes and Elves, come to your house asking for some help to revive the Harvest Goddess, who was turned stone. To bring her back to life, you have to collect Music Notes that are achieved by doing certain things. Some are easy, such as not touching the controller for a while, but then there are others require some more dedication, such as catching every fish in the game. It wouldn\\'t be out of the question to compare them to Xbox 360 achievement points. You really don\\'t have to get all of the notes, but it does add some incentive to play the game more.  After all of the introduction scenes are over you can begin your farming life. You start with basically nothing. You have your land, a set of tools, and that’s about it. You have to progress from there. You can eventually buy more land, barns, chicken coops and many other things to make your farm the best it can be. Making a good farm also helps out Flower Bud Village, new people move in and more businesses are established based on your contributions your farm has made.  The daily routine usually involves first taking care of your animals by feeding them and giving them affection. Giving them affection will usually make your animals give you better products. A cow, for example, will make better milk if you give it lots of love and care over time. Then, you usually have to go water your crops so they grow big and healthy so you can make some money. The rest of the day is up to you. You could go mining and obtain jewels to sell them for a profit, or you could go fishing. You could also go and friendships and relationships with the villagers by talking to them each day and presenting them with gifts, which will then help you get married or get certain gifts or benefits.   New to this Harvest Moon is a stamina gauge. Before, your character would just stop for a moment and take a breath if he or she was tired, but now there is a bar at the bottom of the screen that decreases as you work during the day. If it happens to go all the way done, you pass out and end if in the doctor’s building and then you have to rest for the rest of the day. The problem is that it’s way too limiting. The gauge can grow bigger if you get certain berries, but at the beginning of the game it’s too small and your bad quality tools drain it easily. If it gets really low you have two options: get some food to replenish it or end your day. Obviously, the latter might be a little inconvenient, but usually trying to fish will drop the gauge to 0% and at the beginning, you might not be able to afford the food at the stores. It becomes less of a problem later in the game, when the gauge is bigger, and your new tools don’t drain it so easily, but at the beginning it’s a real chore.   There are many festivals in the game. Most of these consist of you having you donate something so the festival can actually take place, such as an egg for the Egg Festival, but most of these are pretty uninteresting. Others involve you having your farm animals compete against your rival’s farm animals. Most of these can’t be won at the beginning of the game, so there is lot of incentive to play through many years during the game. Then there are other festivals that involve you and somebody else of the opposite sex on a romantic date. These are usually pretty boring as only a couple of lines are said and then it’s over. Also, if you decide to marry the person you went on this date with, you’ll have to hear the same lines every year of the game.  Compared to A Wonderful Life, the graphics feel like a serious downgrade. The once rich and lavish textures aren’t there anymore and the game just doesn’t feel as immersive. The game looks as cutesy as ever, but that works too its advantage. Frame rate problems often occur when there are lots of things on screen and that becomes pretty annoying because situations like that often occur. The game sounds a little dated, too. The sound effects are good, but some things just seem so unrealistic. Things like how baby chickens and adult chickens both sound the same stands out a little and considering things like this weren’t in the previous Harvest Moon game makes you wonder a little. The music for the most part is good. Some songs just don’t fit in, though.  Though it\\'s not packing the biggest presentational punch, Harvest Moon: Magical Melody delivers the solid addictive gameplay that has been come to be expected from the series for a while now. Sure, it can get a little annoying at times, but it still has a load of things to do that will ensure that you will be playing it for countless amount of hours, and any Harvest Moon veteran or a newcomer with a lot of patience is sure to get a kick out of it.',\n",

       "   'description': 'CellFactor: Revolution is possibly the best game that has been pushed and locked away in the dark. I would not be saying this if it costed anything more than $10. The game is just put down because hardly anyone has the intelligence to buy a good CPU or where against purchasing a PPU. Really I average around 30fps with an Intel Core 2 Duo E6850 and a GeForce 8600 GTS, no PPU. Though now I do have a 9800 GTX but I have not been able to test because the game refuses to load with the current Nvidia PhysX drivers.  Graphics: Nothing special it looks a lot better than most games that are said to be good looking such as Perfect Dark Zero. Per-pixel motion blur really adds something that not even CoD4 had.  Audio: Can get very annoying hearing your teammates scream out something at you like, there voice is really over the top post produced with very ugly filters. Besides the voice everything other sound is okay.  Gameplay: I am the type of person where I would buy a game just to play around with the PhysX, and the type of person that would dislike playing a game with shit physics [CoD4]. This game has a lot to offer to gamers like myself but to the people who are not too interested in physics would hate the game. Just look at how Alarm Fur Cobra turned out, all the players who do not care too much or at that simply hate the game.  Every \"loose\" object is dynamic and even some structures can be destroyed. Every character can interact with the dynamic objects by moving them with the characters body, shooting, telekinetic powers, vehicles and jumping. You can get kills by doing lots of different things; shooting explosive, hurling objects, weapons, run over with vehicles, slam (only for Guardian), using environmental objects to topple them and even throwing a vortex based grenade. Cons: Voices are annoying, at the time you were forced to buy a PPU which would of been a major turn off to those who cannot afford one, no singleplayer, no story. Pros: Physics, destruction, “PhysX Kills”, AI is actually intelligent, balanced gameplay, weapons feel realistic, crazy multiplayer, dynamic fluids, gases and cloths. Conclusion: The game would only appeal to the “Physics Gaming” community of players, other than that most other people will simply hate the game because they will not feel what is good about the game.',\n",

       "  {'deck': 'Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Review',\n",
       "   'description': 'Editor\\'s Note: I wrote this review a long time ago. I think it needs some polish. I still agree with everything I said, however the review itself isn\\'t that well written. I still think I bring out some good points though, so the review can still be helpful to those seeking advise.While lots of people would think that a game based on the court of the law would be very boring, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney is a game that is anything but boring. The game could appeal to a group people because it is an adventure game, a genre that some would say has been “dead” for a while now. It is also the first time any game in the series has made its way here to United States. While this may be a remake of the first game for Game Boy Advance, chances are, you have not played that game and this would make a nice introduction to the series, and it is also just a nice change of pace altogether. In this game you play as a Phoenix Wright, a defense attorney, who is just barely getting his career started, which becomes quite evident at the very beginning of the game. He does not appear to know too much of the trade and he seems to have rookie slapped all over him, even in the last case of the game. The entire story of the game is just fantastic thanks to its great cast of funny and engaging characters, the great plot of each of the cases, and all of the many hysterical moments the game will give you. The only time where you will not find yourself smiling while playing the game is when you are stuck with one of the game’s very challenging puzzles.  The gameplay of Phoenix Wright should not be simply overshadowed by the game’s superb storyline; the game is still entertaining when you are not reading text. The very first case is a simple tutorial to how the game works, so not too much could be expected from it. The game basically holds your hand the entire case, which makes it very easy. Do not let that be an initial impression, though; the game proves to get much harder in the next 4 cases, maybe even a little too hard. Before a case you do your investigation; here, you look for clues in each area, and talk with everybody that might know something that could help. You can expect to present lots of evidence to people to get them to tell you information. After a day of investigation, you go to trial with all of the information you have gathered. In court, the prosecutor will call upon a witness. The witness will then give their testimony of the case. Afterwards, you have to cross-examine their testimony, and try to point out a contradiction in the case. This proves more challenging than it sounds; not everything is just going to wave at you and say it is a contradiction. This continues for 3 in-game days until the truth behind each case is finally revealed. The game over system in the game is quite unique. If you present wrong evidence to form a contradiction, or pick a wrong answer when the judge asks you a question you receive a penalty; when you get 5 penalties you lose the case and your client is found guilty. This is what makes the game as hard as it is.  The game does not look too much different from what it looked like on the Game Boy Advance, but that still can\\'t stop you from noticing how great the game looks. The game looks much brighter, crisper, and clearer than it did on the Game Boy hardware. The game\\'s excellent manga style will just leave you in awe, and you can not help but notice how colorful the game is. If there are any complaints, it should only be that the characters could have a few more animations, but even that is forgivable. As for the game\\'s sound, there is not a whole lot to hate. There are a lot of catchy tunes here to like. You can even have the option to say \"Objection!\" into the microphone. The microphone is not very picky, so if you want to act like Mr. T and being a lawyer at the same time, you can feel free to do so.  If you do not include the first case, the cases are very long. However, this might not become self-evident, as you will feel you blew through all of them so quickly. This is not so much of the game’s fault, as the game is not really that short, but you always feel like they could have added in another case. All five cases in the game should roughly last you about a week. Unfortunately, the game does not offer too much replayibility, but it is nice to look back at the story every once and a while.  If you are looking for something new you really can not go wrong with Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. The story alone is enough to warrant a purchase, but it also has very nice and challenging adventure aspects to it that make it much more than a great story. The game will just quite simply leave you with a smile just thinking about. It also stands as one of the best games for the DS, and just quite simply can not be ignored.',\n",

       "   'description': \"Editor's Note: I wrote this review a long time ago. I think it needs some polish. I still agree with everything I said, however the review itself isn't that well written. I still think I bring out some good points though, so the review can still be helpful to those seeking advise.Brain Age has been quite the phenomenon in Japan. It's one of the main reasons why the DS is selling so well there. Brain Age is actually more of a tool than it is a game, which is something Nintendo has been trying to make to capture the mainstream. Now, Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day is out in North America so now Americans can see what all the buzz was about.  Brain Age revolves around the idea that when people stop using their brain that their brain gets old and inefficient. Luckily, Brain Age contains a number of activities to keep your brain young and healthy. The game will show you how much you have progressed over time with graphs. You can also take a test to see how old your brain is, with 20 being the ideal age. The game also comes with many handfuls of sudoku puzzles, which also are supposed to keep your brain in shape.  You play the game with the touch screen and microphone alone in the activities. You also play the game by holding the DS sideways, which will seem strange at first, but actually works out fairly well. The main tasks you have include math calculations and reading abilitiy testers. Eventually, you unlock plenty of other modes. These modes can pretty addicting, and you'll have the incentive to want to beat your own score, or better yet, the score or someone else who has their own progress being saved on the copy of the game.  The fact that the game sorely uses the touch screen and microphone can be an advantage and a disadvantage. The controls with the touch screen feel intuitive, but sometimes the littlest dot could make the game think your 2 is a 7 and since you get penalized for making mistakes, this can be quite frustrating. The microphone also works pretty well, but it could also mistake one thing for another, but most of the time it works pretty well. It should be noted that the game is meant for native speakers, so if you have an accent of some kind, you might run into problems.  The game isn't thriving with polygons or the biggest graphical effects, but that really doesn't matter, because this is more of a tool than it is a game. You shouldn't be expecting too much from the audio department, because you really wouldn't need to hear music or any sound effects for that matter. You shouldn't worry about the presentation too much, because it really isn't needed, but it would have been nice.  The appeal of the main game doesn't last too long if you don't have another person to compare progress with, but if you do have someone that could be potentially interested in this game, it might be worth looking into, especially since it's at a budget price. There is also a bunch of sudoku puzzles to keep you interested. The game also features multiplayer, but this is just a basic test to see who can math problems the quickest. The game could have lasted much longer with the ability to transfer graphs with your friends, or possibly, around the world with online play.  Brain Age is an interesting application and it might be worth looking into, whether because of the basic puzzles it features or whether you're just looking for something new or interesting at a budget price. Puzzle fans are bound to like it, but they should question whether or not if it's worth buying if they won't be playing it for anytime too long.\",\n",

       "   'description': '\\xa0Editor\\'s Note: I wrote this review a long time ago. I think it needs some polish. I still agree with everything I said, however the review itself isn\\'t that well written. I still think I bring out some good points though, so the review can still be helpful to those seeking advise.At E3 2004, Nintendo revealed the Nintendo DS. One of the first games they showed off for it was Metroid Prime: Hunters. Now, after what feels like it has been a very long time, it is finally out. Unfortunately, a boring single-player campaign and some strange restrictions and flaws in online multiplayer leave a lot be desired.  The Adventure mode takes place between the original Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime 2: Echoes with everybody\\'s favorite bounty hunter, Samus Aran, going into the Alimbic Cluster looking for artifacts known as \"octoliths\" that supposedly contain the \"ultimate power\". This time around, Samus isn\\'t the only one looking for them; along the campaign you will find several other hunters looking for these octoliths that you must defeat. The other hunters each sport their own unique weapons and abilities, and can be unlocked in the multi-player mode after you defeat them. If you happen to be defeated by one of these hunters, they will take all of those octoliths you worked so hard to get, but if you defeat them later, you will recover all of the octoliths you lost before, although, it’s just easier to turn the power off once you die, so it really isn’t as much of a problem as it seems to be.  The controls in Metroid Prime: Hunters are hard to get into, but if you are willing enough to master them, then you will have near perfect control over your hunter. The game has two different control schemes; one where you move the stylus over the touch screen to aim and the D-Pad to move forward and another where you use the D-Pad to move forward and use the buttons to imitate another analog stick to aim. The stylus control gives a much more precise aiming control, which makes it feel a lot like the aiming mechanics used for modern first-person shooters on the PC, than the typical dual-analog control seen on consoles, and overall it\\'s much better than the other mode. It should be noted that this a portable game, so the standard mode with the D-Pad and buttons can come in handy when on a bumpy road. Also, left-handed people need not worry, because both modes have a left-handed version, as well.  The controls aren\\'t perfect, though. To change into morph ball mode, switch weapons, and to scan objects, you have to tap icons on the bottom screen, which could accidentally be pressed when aiming. This can be frustrating, but it actually doesn\\'t turn out to be too much of a problem, after you get used to controlling the game.  The superb control mechanics don\\'t automatically make the single-player campaign good, though. Unlike the previous Metroid Prime games, the planets you will explore are very linear. Sure, there is some door you\\'ll have to open with a weapon you get later in the game, or an easy-to-solve morph ball puzzle here and there, but mostly everything is pretty straight forward. Also, many of the planets are structured the same way. It\\'s almost pretty much land on the planet, defeat a hunter, reach the boss, defeat the boss, get the octolith, and then reach your ship before the time-ticker clicks to zero . This and the recycled boss design make the single player very repetitive, and the single-player campaign pretty much not very enjoyable.  The multiplayer component holds up just a tad better than the single-player, but it also has its fair share of problems, too. The game features single-cart, multi-cart, and online play, over Nintendo\\'s relatively new service, for 4 people. The single-cart has almost every feature the multi-cart play has except the people downloading content have to play as Samus, you are limited to battle mode, and you can\\'t add bots if you can\\'t get a full game of 4 people, but this is really little loss, since you are having to share game content. Also, in multi-cart mode it\\'s very noticeable that you have a wide variety of options, for example, you can choose whether or not you can see your opponents on the game radar.  Playing online with friends turns out to be better than with random people. You can view what friends are online, and host or join a game. You will also have access to all of the modes and change the options like multi-card play. You\\'ll also be able to use the system\\'s built-in microphone before and after the game, but for some reason, you can\\'t use this with anybody else. The voice reception is pretty good and I ran into few flaws with it. Overall, the online play with friends can be very fun, but one has to wonder why most of the benefits could only be accessed with them.  Metroid Prime: Hunters has a very impressive presentation. It starts off with a trailer that in almost every way shows off how powerful the DS really is, and there are a lot more cut scenes like it in the single-player campaign to be awed at. In game, the planets look pretty good and they have some neat effects. One minor problem is that sometimes it’s too dark in one are making seeing things a big challenge. In multiplayer, it can be hard to see your enemies from in long distance battles, but thankfully the game has icons to show where the person is, which helps out a little bit. On the other hand, this game sounds great. There is a lot of classic music from other Metroid games, and the weapon sound effects are great. Some of the hunters’ sound effects are a little annoying, though, mainly there cries when they get hit, because they are too loud and you’ll hear them too often in multiplayer.  This game doesn’t offer too much value. The single-player doesn’t have enough incentive to play through it once, let alone multiple times. One could go through just to get all of the multiplayer characters, but those can be earned by beating someone in multiplayer who is using a character you need to unlock. The single-player should last around 10 hours, and maybe 6 or 7 if you’re really good. The online multiplayer adds some sort of extra value, but really the strange restrictions and flaws do not let that last too long. Most of the value comes from the local multiplayer, but to get the most out of that you need at least two friends with a DS.  Metroid Prime: Hunters leaves a lot to be desired. It is a game that was delayed, so online multiplayer could be added, but that didn’t turn out as well as hoped. Maybe that time could have been used to make a better-developed single-player campaign, which is what the Metroid Prime games were focusing on to begin with. Ultimately, Metroid Prime: Hunters has good intentions, but it’s filled with flaws that only hold it back from what it should be.',\n",

       "   'description': \"Editor's Note: I wrote this review a long time ago. I think it needs some polish. I still agree with everything I said, however the review itself isn't that well written. I still think I bring out some good points though, so the review can still be helpful to those seeking advise.Nintendogs is a dog simulation made by Nintendo (If you haven't noticed the company's name in the title), where you can love, teach tricks to, and just have fun with some virtual dogs. Does it work? Well yes, it does. And it works well, with some innovative uses of the Nintendo DS' touch screen and microphone. But what stops the game from meeting its full potential?  Raising the virtual dogs is actually pretty fun. You can use the touch screen to pet your dog, throw your frisbee, and unsurprisingly, use it to cycle through the menus. The game also uses the microphone function. Unfortunately that function doesn't work as well. You use the microphone, to call your dog, and tell it to do a specific trick. The only problem is the microphone's recognition isn't very good at all. I noticed that sometimes my dog just quite plainly wouldn't come to my command. What is strange, though, is that I had to say it in a higher pitched voice than I originally said the first time I was naming dog. Another problem is the dog mistaking one word for another. It’s not a simple mistaking sit for shake thing. Sometimes it can be as horrible mistaking beg for spin. So you have to teach the dog the trick, again, so it gets it correctly. If you get another dog, it may also mistake its name for the other dog’s name. If that happens there is nothing you can do about it except for starting with a new dog. This can be very frustrating, and is by far the game’s biggest fault, and overall just leaves much to be desired.  The game seems to capture the realism of raising real dogs quite well, but it also adds in some Nintendo charm, without taking the realism away all that much. Some dogs are nice and easy to train, while others are more selfish and are very hard to teach. As you go for your walks you’ll meet into other dogs, and their owners. More than half of the time the owner has nothing all that interesting to say, with maybe a few changed comments when you take a different breed of dog out for a walk. But the more interesting part is seeing how the dogs react to each other. Like in real life, some dogs may hate each other and start tackling each other to death, while some dogs get along nicely, and play with each other. When you interact with your dog with some toys or some other item, some may want to play with that item, while others are scared and continuously bark at it.   During your walks you may run into some items. Some times it could be a lousy tissue box. Other times it could be a Mario hat. There is a very large list of items in the game. Some are pretty neat. Like the pull rope. Basically you hold one side of the rope with the touch screen and the dog holds the other, and it’s basically a tug-o-war. But if you spin real fast you could be spinning your dog up in the air. They’re also accessories that your dog will be able to wear, such collars and ribbons. And some even more ridiculous ones such as a pirate hat or a pair of glasses. With these items there seems to be a lot of Nintendo references. Such as the Mario hat or the “bark ball” which makes Pikmin noises when it bounces. This adds a lot of charm to the game that can’t really be seen anywhere else.  Competitions are also very important to the game. There are three categories for a competition: Disc, agility, and obedience. Your objective is to get in the Top Three in order to make it to the next round. In the disc trial you have to throw the disc, and get your dog to catch it. The farther you throw it the more points you get, and another point added if your dog catches it in midair. The next one is the obedience trial. You have to perform certain tricks with your dog in this competition. Sometimes it can be a little tricky, because instead of just begging, you may have to keep your dog in that position for over 10 seconds. Your score will then be evaluated by the three judges. Unfortunately, these two trials are a bit easy. The disc trial is easy, because the frisbee mechanics are easy to master, and basically if throw hard, and throw straight you’re going to rack in some points. As for the obedience trial, that’s another story. The judges are a bit lenient. I think once I messed up on three tricks, and I got a 9.1! This makes it a little too easy to score first place. The next trial and probably the hardest of the all is the agility trial. You basically just have to guide your dog around a course, where he or she will have to jump over poles or run through tubes. The competitions are really fun, and it adds a lot of incentive to train your dog.  This game is very addicting. This actually is rather a shame, since this is more of a game where you play maybe 30 minutes to 1 hour a day rather than playing it all night long like most games. This is, because of the fact that you can only enter your dog in three competitions a day and you can only take it out for a walk every 30 minutes. After maybe a week or, so I have to admit, doing the same thing over and over again started to get a little old. The faulty voice recognition is definitely holding this game back from being the most repayable game it can be. Another problem is that the game isn’t very portable. You can’t really say “Roll Over!” without the disturbing the person next to you, and the game requires you to use the microphone a lot.  This game just looks fantastic. The puppies themselves are the best part. Each one has their own fur shading that looks beautiful. While the backgrounds don’t seem to have received the same amount of care they still look good, but nothing all that spectacular. I also noticed some frame rate drops. This mainly happens when one dog was interacting with another one, but nothing, too serious. Overall this is one of the best looking DS games, and it may keep that title for a long time.  The games music could have been better. In your house there is no music. This may seem a little strange, but it’s not a huge deal, since you’re probably going to be too sunk into gameplay to notice. When you go for a walk there is music. Just one song that is sort of catchy, but after a while it just gets old. The sound effects are just wonderful! The dogs each have their own different sounding bark. You may also hear a random fire truck or maybe even a bicycle, but they each sound like that specific object, and overall this may be one the better DS games when it comes to sound effects.  Nintendogs is a fun game with the best graphics you will ever see on the DS. Unfortunately, the game doesn’t have enough things you can do to keep you playing it for anytime longer than 2 weeks, and it clearly exposes the faulty DS microphone. Nintendogs won’t keep its appeal for anytime too long, but it would make an excellent rental.\",\n",

       "   'description': 'Editor\\'s Note: I wrote this review a long time ago. I think it needs some polish. I still agree with everything I said, however the review itself isn\\'t that well written. I still think I bring out some good points though, so the review can still be helpful to those seeking advise.After making Shadow the Hedgehog, which was considered a horrible game by many critics and consumers, alike, Sega and Sonic Team have now made Sonic Riders, a racer starring many old Sonic characters and some new ones. It will not take someone long to find out that Sonic Riders is mostly a fan service for Sonic loyalists, but racing fans looking for something new could enjoy it, too.  The story in Sonic Riders is fairly simple and not that engaging overall and it does require some knowledge of the Sonic world, so if you haven\\'t played that many Sonic games, it might be a little hard to understand. Basically, Sonic\\'s nemesis, Dr. Eggman, has started an \"Extreme Gear\" (what the vehicles are called in the game) contest. To enter the contest the particepents must give up one Chaos Emerald and the winner gets to take it all. New to the series\\' character roster this year are Jet, Wave, and Storm, three thieves known as the \"Babylon Rouges\". Sonic and gang join the tournament, because they want to find out what Dr. Eggman is up to, while the Babylon Rouges are trying to find out things about their ancient Babylonian ancestors, but none of this is really all that interesting. One of the storyline\\'s main attractions is the nice old-school cartoon style, such as when one character tries explaining something very confusing to somebody who is not all that bright, and then the dumb fellow\\'s eyes starting rolling in his eye sockets rapidly out of confusion.  The racing in Sonic Riders is the main attraction. You ride on hover boards, which use air as fuel. As you\\'re racing the hover board’s supply of fuel starts to wither away and even more so if you boost. Well, what do you do to get more air? Pull of some tricks, when going off of ramps, of course! It\\'s not very logical, but it\\'s good enough for the game. Another way to get air is to go through a path designed exclusively for each type of character. These include speed, fly, and power types. Speed characters can grind on rails by jumping onto them, fly characters go off of ramps and into giant rings which make them fly forward across the course skipping much of the standard path they would have to take, otherwise, and power characters can knock over obstacles that would normally harm other characters, and they can knock walls, which leads them into an alternate path full of more obstacles so they can gain more air.  Another neat little feature in Sonic Riders is the turbulence. When a character starts to really take off they create a stream of turbulence behind them. Characters can jump into the turbulence and can move forward without having to waste their air, and they can jump off the sides of the turbulence and perform tricks and get even more air. One flaw of the turbulence is that it can end rather abruptly and lead you right off the edge of a cliff. Putting that aside, the turbulence is a great feature that feels really satisfying to use.  There is also a level-up feature in the game. On the course, there are rings scattered everywhere and when you collect enough you\\'ll level up, with three levels in total. Leveling up can upgrade your hover board’s air gauge, which will let you hold more air. The strength and effect of your character\\'s attack, which is initiated by getting close to an opponent when boosting, will become better. The level-up feature isn\\'t exactly new to racing games, but it does add some objectives during races.  The game\\'s controls are okay. They do take a little getting used to, but after that you should be fine. Sometimes the game is a little more demanding than it should have to be, such as making you jump and then push the jump button again right before you land on a rail, just so you can do something simple like grinding. Also, there are moments, where the game makes you spin the joystick around, just to drift down the water current quickly, or take the lift up to the finish line quickly, which feels unneeded.  Unfortunately, the multi-player aspect of the game doesn\\'t work out too well. There is just too much going on for three or four people to share one screen. And there\\'s no online play for any version of the game, which could have fixed that problem. There are a bunch of modes that can be played in multi-player, but none of these are quite as fun as a standard race. You could maybe play with one other friend, but it just gets out of hand with three or four people.  This is definitely a pretty looking game. The races look bright and colorful, and the tricks you pull off look down right impressive. The races run at a pretty steady frame rate, and look very crisp and clean. In the story model, you\\'ll find two different types of cut scenes. The first type are the CG cut scenes. These look very impressive, and have a great clean look to them. The other type is, of course, the non-CG. These are fairly decent, but they look like they were recycled from some of Sonic\\'s Dreamcast outings, and just don\\'t look as good as the CG cut scenes. Plus, one would think that all of the cut scenes would be CG, since this generation is starting to come to a close and developers are learning how to take advantage of all the console\\'s capabilities, and making excellent looking games like Resident Evil 4, which keeps its excellent look throughout the entire game.  The sound quality in Sonic Riders leaves a lot to be desired, and is arguably the worst part about the entire game. The soundtrack isn\\'t the problem, here, in fact it can be actually quite entertaining to listen to, and can keep you hyped during the race. The main problem here is the horrible voice acting. Some of the voice actors put little enthusiasm into their lines, while others put too much, and some of the voices are just irritating to hear. Also, the commentator for the races often repeats things a lot within one race, which gets annoying quickly. There aren\\'t many sound effects, but just hearing a huge \"swoosh\" when passing by someone can give you a feel of how you really are going.  For a huge Sonic fan, this game offers a lot of extras to do after you finish the main story mode. There are a bunch of Sonic and Sega characters that can be unlocked, and two special Sega courses. After you beat story mode, there is a mission mode similar to the one seen in Mario Kart DS, but this isn\\'t much fun, because it\\'s mostly a bunch of boring tasks, that feels more like a chore than something that\\'s supposed to be entertaining. If you\\'re just a person just looking for a new twist to racing games, this game offers a good rental, but not much more than that.  Sonic Riders is definitely not the best racer out there, but it is still quite a lot of fun. There\\'s quite a lot of things here Sonic fans will like, and it will satisfy people looking for something more than you\\'re typical racer. Thanks to the fact that the game launched 10 dollars cheaper than most games, this game is easily a recommendation for Sonic fans to buy, but maybe a rental for everybody else.',\n",

       "   'description': \"Gameplay: 8.5I loved this game when I first started playing it. I was a relative newcomer to RPG's and I still am, but the combat system was fun, simple, and akin to any action game. I was pleased to see that there were no turns, nor number popping up in the air. Left-click to attack. Right-click to block. Simple. There are many MANY quests to complete but I was disappointed that the faction quests were not more fleshed out. Instead I was sent on random errands to occupy myself, when I just wanted more assassination contracts! Other than that, there were little frustrations like quests being incompatable with each other, but that's mostly been fixed by patches. Ignoring these flaws, you could easily squeeze over 40 hours out of this game, and that's assuming you rush through it like the world is ending tomorrow, and you won't. You'll WANT to experience more of this immersive world. Graphics:8.0For the time, the graphics were absolutely stunning, and still push many mid-range PC's to the limit. The lighting was gorgeous, and watching a sunset in Oblivion was a unique experience, despite it only holding my attention for a few seconds (minor case of ADD). However the visuals were far from perfect, despite my generous 8.0. Glitches were everywhere. Clipping issues, objects getting stuck in other objects, possessed paintbrush jars twitching madly or levitating clean off the floor. These are all common occurances within the great realm of Oblivion. Audio: 10Audio's great. Swords clashing, shields bashing, steel boots clanking with every step, and epic orchestral scores all compliment the atmosphere. Nothing more to say. Flawless.If you're playing this in the middle of the day, with a fresh mind of optimism, this game is epically wonderful, and wonderufully epic. If you're playing it in the wee hours of the morning with bloodshot eyes and a short temper, then the technical glitches with simply ruin the experience. So, if you're the picky type, you might wanna keep reading reviews or give this one a rent. If you just want a good game for your money that'll last you, pick this one up. \",\n",

       "   'description': 'Call of Duty is back and better than ever. Ditching the WWII theme in favour of “Modern Warfare” is certainly what makes this instalment stand out from the rest. With the change in theme you get to play as either a British SAS soldier or an American Marine - with the roles interchanging as the single player progresses. There is a marked difference between playing as either - as a marine you will find yourself with dozens of fellow soldiers at your side, taking on the enemy in a middle eastern setting. The SAS missions centre around a small team of the most elite counter-terrorist unit in the world, infiltrating installations and going up against hordes of Russian rebels across eastern Europe. The game is one of the most intense first-person experiences you will ever encounter; while the single player may be rather short, the quality of what is there makes up for it. Along with the fact that if you bump up the difficulty - it’s going to take considerably longer to finish. One of the reasons for it’s level of intensity is that it is a very linear game - there are never more that two ways to approach the next objective, so you won’t need to think about which direction you need to be in. As a result the game can throw as many set pieces as it likes at you, which while some might question as to whether that is a positive thing, here it is what makes the single player so fun to play.Enemy AI is improved as you would expect, they can be very aggressive and come right for you, or hang back and throw grenades at your feet. You and your teamates can throw grenades back, but then so can the enemy. Team AI is good and there are many times they save your life - especially on Veteran difficulty. There are parts when you notice enemies are spawning at a location and the only way to stop them is to actually move forward. While a little disheartening it is understandable, this isn’t a game where you win by sitting back like a sissy, this is run and gun gameplay where the only progress you’re going to make is with a pair. Modern Warfare is about as varied as you could expect a shooter to be. You’ll encounter soldiers, helicopters, wild dogs, tanks and jeeps. You’ll take them out with RPGs, machine guns, pistols, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, grenades, flash bangs, SMGs, shotguns, C4, claymores, grenade launchers, helicopters, miniguns, an AC-130, airstrikes, bare hands and your trusty knife with it’s one-hit-kill. The AC-130 mission is something never done before: you’re in a gunship overlooking friendlies making there way through a town and it’s your job to provide them cover using the thermal imaging and a choice of 2 cannons and a rail gun. The result is a rather scarily realistic (as a result of the thermal imaging) demolition of the hapless enemies that rag-doll across the terrain when one of your shells hits. While not set in WWII, the gameplay is very similar to what you have come to expect from CoD2 for example. Aiming down the sight plays a big role on and offline, and the style of the game has Infinity Ward all over it. Graphically, the game is very impressive. It is a wonder that the 360 can still be improving in that department with an eye-bleeding frame rate to match. Lighting and particle effects are spot on and the graphics are pretty much on par for the online mode. The online mode is where you will spend most of your time (hopefully). This has to be one of the best crafted online shooter experiences to date, a multitude of maps come out of the box, a matchmaking system is implemented similar to Halo 3, and once you are in a round the gameplay is every bit as rewarding as in the single player - or more when you remember these are actual people you’re taking on. The perk system is a lovely way to mix it up with some dropping grenades when they die and others with deeper bullet penetration so no wall can save you. There is no cover system in the multiplayer but you really don’t want one - as mentioned bullets can go through walls, and you don’t want to be pressed up against one when the cover it provides is limited. Sniping is a great deal of fun and wearing a ghillie suit makes you almost impossible to spot when lying still in a field. I can’t tell you how many times I decided to just hide while 6 enemies walk right passed me. It’s moments like that that make the game special. Get a 3 kill streak and you’ll have yourself a UAV which will locate every enemy on the map (unless they have the UAV jammer perk); a 5 kill streak and you can call in an airstrike, a 7 kill streak and you’ll call in a friendly helicopter that will seek out the enemy and blow them to smithereens. Game modes are what you’d expect with Hardcore being a little different in that there is no HUD and increased damage. But essentially it is the same game type. Pretty much all the weapons including explosives and the knife can be used online, so you can do a whole lot of bad stuff to your adversaries. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is a must-buy for any shooter fan and I highly recommend it.',\n",

       "   'description': 'Assassin\\'s Creed: Director\\'s Cut Edition (PC)[review originally posted on the Adventure Gamers forums]So I finally had a chance to play this, specifically the PC \"Director\\'s Cut\" version which is different in its greater variety of side-missions (adding Rooftop Race, Merchant-Stand Destruction, Archer Assassination and Assassin Escort).I loooove the exploration. I like how intuitive the Parkour is, allowing you to focus on being awesome rather than having to think about the steps required to achieve awesome.I\\'m not sure I buy into the reasoning behind Altair forgetting how to dodge and grab ledges as he\\'s stripped of his rank at the start of the game, but once you\\'ve run some missions and regained your station you\\'ve got a pretty sweet arsenal of skills at your fingertips. And it\\'s literally fingertips as the buttons on the 360 pad - still on the PC - correspond to your weapon hand, your free hand, your eyes and your legs... with the right trigger acting as a switch between high- and low profile, each action depending on context. So for example using your free hand in low profile allows you to gently push past your fellow pedestrians, while using it in high profile will let you grab and throw them.The game\\'s historical setting is something truly special. Three great ancient cities are brought to life in startling detail: Acre, Jerusalem and Damascus, each of them with its own distinctive ambiance. Truly a marvel. It\\'s a bit of a shame then that the game\\'s over-arching narrative is so at odds with it. We are thrust into the shoes of Desmond Miles, a modern-day bartender kidnapped by some shadowy corporation for the purpose of \\'exploring his genetic memory\\', specifically that of his Hashshashin ancestor Altair in the Holy Land of 1191. It\\'s all very \"meta\" and, while kind of interesting, strikes me as ultimately unnecessary, lacking the elegance of Sands of Time.It would have been okay if they\\'d reserved the Matrixy glitches for when the \\'simulation\\' was actually breaking down or initializing (such as in the first few moments, or when loading memories) but hints of fakery are found throughout: on collectible flags, on the glowing selection effect and on the goddamn popups that appear all the time long after you\\'ve finished all tutorials.At least you can turn the HUD off.Actually, the game was at its best I found when played entirely blind. That is to say, forget the GPS, don\\'t even use the map more than once or twice and just explore... Climb a few towers to figure out where you are. Once you\\'ve done a few missions it\\'s easy enough to recognize what you\\'re looking for (eg Assassin\\'s Bureau) and with \\'sixth sense\\' vision it\\'s easy enough to pick out your targets if you take the time.Which is why I was surprised at the highly arbitrary time limits imposed on some side-missions. Why you had to do the standard Stealth Assassination in minutes when you could take your sweet time with the Archer Assassination I have no idea, but neither I think were in any hurry to leave town. Same with the (corrupt) Merchant-Stand Destruction. When you\\'re being chased by guards because you just buried one of their colleagues in a pile of wood and assorted groceries it\\'s kinda hard to slip away and anonymously report back to your buddy in under three minutes. Sans the time-pressure would have been more enjoyable.Also I would like to know how Altair back in 1191 managed to do the Rooftop Race Challenge without functioning GPS. I can suspend disbelief on the haystack diving for gameplay purposes, but this is stretching it.Given how free-form most of the game is, it\\'s a bit perplexing that when the time comes for your target to die you are often required to move to a very specific position before events start to unfold in semi-cutscene form. When the talking starts you\\'re still able to move around, but you cannot choose to move in and cut the monologue short with a well-placed stab in the back. It\\'s only when the cinematic is over that you may proceed... In some missions this is more restrictive than others as often there\\'s still enough room to act on your own terms, but just as often you will find yourself in highly impractical and conspicuous locations. It kind of defeats the purpose of all that careful preparation.The main criticism leveled at Assassin was repetition, which I don\\'t think weighs as heavily now as it did for the 360 version. As long as you don\\'t try to rush it there\\'s plenty variety to keep you entertained till the credits roll.The game looks and sounds amazing. If you\\'ve got a rig that can handle it - I was able to hijack my housemate\\'s PC for the purpose - and turn it up to full settings it is the stuff that blows minds. There\\'s some issues with level of detail here and there and the aforementioned intentional glitches somewhat diminish the atmosphere but it never ceases to be genuinely awesome. The animation and the way it ties into interaction with the crowd and the environment is nothing short of groundbreaking.So the verdict in the end? It\\'s not perfect. Still, I can\\'t help but love this game.',\n",

       "   'description': 'This game sucks. Let\\'s start with the tolerable:Graphics: 7.5The graphics are sharp and crisp. Minimal clipping issues and other glitches. Nothing special, but gets the job done.Audio: 9.0Smashing a dude\\'s head into the corner of a table shouldn\\'t sound this satisfying. The soundtrack is good too, with the original Bourne scores from the movies, and a few original recordings just for the game. Gameplay:4.0 (wish I could just leave this to the Angry Videogame Nerd)I was disappointed. I was expecting BOURNE!! I never even finished this crappy game because quite frankly, you\\'ve seen one level and you\\'ve seen them all. You\\'re doing the same very basic things over and over. Run into room. Take cover from bullets. Get shot anyway because cover system is aweful and un-responsive. Exit cover. Try to shoot people. Run out of ammo because it takes atleast 10 bullets to kill someone. Charge them out of frustration, disarm, use fast attack until blocked. Switch to strong attack until you can build up your adrenaline meter. Use super finisher, watch awesome cutscene of your character kicking ass. Move to next room, and repeat. Can you see why this gets old quickly? I never even made it to the infamous driving sequence.The Bourne movies were all about suspence, using the environment, and improvising whenever you can, with whatever you can. Everything the series is known for is thrown out the window to make room for this overly simplistic beat \\'em up. What\\'s worse is that this game LOOKS cool. But that\\'s basically what you\\'re doing while \"playing\" the game. Looking. Every cool thing that happens in the game is basically a cutscene and control is taken away from you as you watch your character kick major ass, and when that cutscene ends you\\'re let down all over again, and it\\'s back to the two-punch fighting system (completely devoid of combos. Although kicks are introduced a couple hours in, they\\'re just gimmacks and seem to be there only if you\\'re tired of the punching animations) or the shooting mechanics that make you wanna chew your way through the f$^@&ing controller. I mean, WHAT WERE THEY THIIINKING?? I paid money to rent a game about Bourne, not watch a simplified movie based *somewhat* on a character that happened to steal all of Matt Damon\\'s lines!! I was kinda looking forward to this, like I do for every other liscenced game, thinking it\\'s gonna be the next holy grail that breaks the curse.A mediocre attempt, a below average game on it\\'s own merits. However, the worst part of it is it\\'s name. The *Bourne* Conspiracy. More like Epic Fail Conspiracy. This one gets the official Roguester stamp of SH*T.',\n",

       "   'description': \"Guitar Hero 3: Legends of Rock is the fourth in a series of rhythm games in which the goal is to hit the notes as they scroll down the screen, strumming on the strum bar when they reach the right moment. As the game retails around £69.99 ($89.99) with the Red Octane Les Paul controller it's a well worth investment.The game is pretty much the same as the others in the Guitar Hero franchise with some interesting changes to the layout. The newly designed fret board and frets, with a stylish new rock meter and points counter it altogether looks sleeker.In previous Guitar Hero games, it was hard to 'Hammer-on' and 'Pull-off', but with a new system it is a lot easier to hit those solos and with the difficulty ever more increasing with the games, it looks like you need to take advantage of this feature. Another one of Guitar Hero 3's strong points is the note streak counter. When you get around 28 notes in a row it starts to count them and show them, this is useful to Xbox 360 users for the achievements, and it is also nice to see how well you are doing.A major flaw in this game is the difficulty, if you are used to playing Guitar hero 2, it will seem easier due to the Hammer-on and pull off changes, but if you are a beginner it is best to start on an easier version of the game. Although hard, it is do-able so if you really want Guitar Hero 3 and you feel you will fail at it, get it anyway as by playing it you become better very quickly.The hardest song in Guitar Hero 3 is Through the fire and the flames by Dragon Force with immense solo's you'd be lucky to get past 2%.The Wii version of Guitar Hero 3 generally plays well with it sometimes lagging or stalling at points, when going to a new screen, requiring you to reset your console.The new look design of the fret board, rock meter and points counter look better than previous Guitar Hero games. As Neversoft have used green screen and motion capture technology, the movement of the characters and even the singers mouth moves to the song very well, although it does look huge and kind of out of proportion.Also the set list of Guitar Hero 3 is probably the best feature of this game with over half of the songs being original and the other half actual good covers, Guitar Hero 3, definitely is the one for music. Although the sound isn't 7.1 Dolby as it said on the box, it is still a brilliant sound output.Red Octane has taken another step in making a better game with their wireless Les Paul Guitars. As all of the next gen systems are wireless, it works well, with the PS2 having a dongle for it to connect. They work well and are better than the old ones a you can truly rock out without the wires affecting your guitar shredding! The Wii version requires you to put your wiimote in the guitar and when you miss a note the sound comes from the remote, which adds to great effect. For storage you can now take off the neck and change face-plates to a more retro look.The game features classics from The Rolling stones', Santana, ZZ Top, The Red Hot Chilli Peppers and many unsigned bands to add together and make a set of top bands. As it is good to have a lot of Originals, the covers still stand out and although aren't as bad as the other Guitar Hero's they are still cringe worthy.Because of all of these new songs, and so many of them there is a lot to cover in the game. With 70 tracks for PS2 and Wii owners and 70+ for those with an Xbox 360, or PS3 connected to the Internet and want to download new ones that are added frequently.The game still has the same characters as Guitar Hero 2 apart from the Grim Ripper, Clive Winston, Eddie Knox and Pandora. The only addition that Guitar Hero 3 adds is Lou, the devil who is unlocked at the end of the game. You can now also be Slash and Tom Morello, with new joke characters Elroy Budvis and Metal head. The big feature for Guitar Hero 3 is the battles feature. Instead of star power you get battles so when you activate your battle attack it will either affect your opponents screen or steal one of their attacks. The attacks include Lefty Flip (when the notes bar is switched to confuse you), Whammy (where you need to whammy to start hitting notes again), Difficulty Up (where your difficulty is increased by one, unless on Expert when it doesn't come up), power-up steal (you take your opponent's power-up) and Amp Overload (where the notes flash on and off making it harder to anticipate when to strum). In total there are three battles in the career, one against Tom Morello from Rage against, one from Slash, from Guns n' Roses and the final, and very tricky one is a tribute called The devil went down to Georgia, by The Charlie Daniels band.Although a good idea in principle when in practice battle mode simply doesn't work. People often save their power-ups and use them one after the other at hard parts, making it impossible for your opponent to recover quick enough, also people online tend to go on the easiest difficulty so that they will be able to survive the barrage of attacks and be able to get power-ups themselves. The worst aspect of the Battle feature of the game is the fact that if you pass the song, something called 'Death Drain' comes up which just drains your performance and makes it harder to see the notes, this is very quick and isn't explained very well in the game. The online modes are available on the Wii, PS3 and Xbox 360, overall the connections are good and people seem to have a great time without many bugs. There are four modes for online, Face-off, Pro face-off, Battle or Co-op. All of your progress throughout the game is tracked with www.GuitarHero.com, which is very useful.If you're looking for a game that has brilliant original music, battles to blow your mind and awesome online that'll rock you out of this world, this is the game to buy!\",\n",

Keeping the combo-meter as pumped-up as possible to get a high score is very addictive. 7. Smooth frame rates. Very very smooth considering all the crazy effects and explosives. 8. Amazingly fluid , matrix-like moves. You can even catch enemies' hats for an added bonus ! 9. Chickens everywhere. Chickens on roofs. Chickens on barrels. Even men with chicken costumes! And you can shoot chickens too ! Awesome! =.= 10. Music is great. Hard to describe... 11. Bosses are amazingly ridiculous... Example... A crazy fat women ( sounds like a man tho' ) with a cleaver and throws dynamite-wrapped chickens while dodging behind chicken coops. And she has an awesome wail as well , makes u go flying when she does so. LoL ~ 12. Lots of crazy weapons and power-ups. * U can even charge like a bull...*  Thumbs-down: 1. Not much to do besides shooting and completing style challenges. 2. The missions are not a lot. Around 30. 3. Story is quite ridiculous. *But who cares? LoL~ * 4. Camera angle can be a bit annoying. But just a bit. A teensy tiny bit.  Conclusion: If u liked crazy shooters and Max Payne, u won't go wrong on this one. Remember, eat chili and die !!! *quoted from Chili Con Carnage*\",\n",

But once u overlook those minor flaws and give it some time to sink in , u'l be surprised at how much the game is able to reel u in.  Thumbs-up: 1. Amazing dungeon making feel . ( Even more if u love 'mazing' ) - there's even a rating system to grade ur dungeon. 2. Some nifty features. e.g. multiplayer ruin dungeons - where u share ur custom-made dungeons with friends and they'l be able to explore it in a Diablo-kinda way. 3. Great variety of maze components that's able for u to personalize ur dungeon to ur liking. 4. Fluid combat. 5. Camera angles are great ( Activate lock-on and auto-camera :-D) 6. Rewarding RPG ( No levels tho, u have to upgrade ur stats via materials u got from killing beasts )and somewhat challenging boss fights.  Thumbs-down: 1. Gets abit repititive over time and when ur dungeon gets  reaaaaly big . 2. Weapons and items could use with abit more variety. 3. Combat animations couldve been better. Simply said, more refined in terms of graphics. 4. The variety of spells are somewhat limited and the effects are not groundbraking. 5. Quests are similiar in nature. ( More variety pls >.< )   Conclusion: A great game for almost anyone. I'l recommend it to anyone anytime. :-D\",\n",

As with many Wii and DS\\xa0fitness games there is also a feature of your Wii Fit age, where you do various activites and your age is based on your overall\\xa0performance. Although it is inovative, it lacks the accuracy that you would hope for. E.g.

       "   'description': 'Let\\'s say it right from the start: this game is AMAZING.You lead the Patapon tribe in their effort to break free from the evil Zigatons. You play the role of their god and you lead them by rhythmically beating on different drums (mapped to the PSP face buttons) to give them orders.It starts out like a simple rhythm game but after a few stages, its strategic nature surfaces as you are presented with various choices of units, equipment and divine powers to face the different challenges the game throws at your little ... ehrm ... weapon-carrying-roundish-things.These challenges can be one of three kinds: hunt stages, where you hunt animals to get money, food and materials to create new units, feed your tribe and live prosperously ... hmm ... delete last one; battle stages pit you against the Zigaton army and by beating the opposing soldiers, you can find new equipment for your Patapons. The last kind of challenge are the boss stages, where you are confronted with a big, nasty monster and your tactics will be heavily tested since a single blow from a boss could wipe half your army if not parried or evaded.You can replay all hunt stages and boss stages anytime you want and you\\'ll definitely want to, because hunt stages let you harvest food and materials to fortify you army and bosses level up each time you defeat them, so their drop gets better each time you face them.The game is deep in the choice of which unit type you bring to battle (you can take up to 3 unit types with you, chosen from 6 total), how you equip your units and, ultimately, how you lead them into battle. Being a rhythm game, you have to constantly listen to the beats and synchronize your orders if you want to succeed in the most difficult battles.The game is really fun and make you want to see what\\'s next or face a boss again and again to try new tactics, equipment or simply have some fun. It\\'s a real pity you can\\'t play online; an army Vs army mode would have been really appreciated. At least they could add a \"showcase\" mode, in which you could send pictures of you strangely assorted army.The game has none of this but it still feels like fresh air in the portable gaming scene.It\\'s a game that still has a place in my \"now playing\" list and the fun it offers I hardly find in other, more recent, games.I\\'d definitely give this game a try if you\\'re unsure you could like it or not. If you hate rhythm games, don\\'t sort this game out from scratch: try the demo and maybe you\\'ll find love =)',\n",

       "   'description': 'Gears Of War is a 3rd-Person Action/Horror game, with genuinely groundbreaking graphics, as well as the most cinematic game design seen for a long time. The game\\'s protagonist, Marcus Fenix, finds himself broken out of prison (having spent some time there for alleged treason) and immediately resumes fighting the ferocious Locust Horde. A vicious army of creatures from below the Earth\\'s crust (or \\'Sera\\' \\'s, the name of the planet) , hell bent on the destruction of all things Human.With your old friend Dominic at your side throughout most of the game\\'s five chapters, you\\'ll battle through beautiful yet decimated cities. Moonlit back streets, mansion estates and moving trains provide great battlegrounds, as you dive, run and duck in and out of abundant cover(using the A button). The mechanic of having to actively seek a place to hide may seem a little less than macho, but the ability to blind fire, jump from cover to cover, and perhaps earn your foe a close encounter with a chainsaw bayonet (oh yes, a chainsaw on the end of your gun) sure make for some of the most intense gaming-action ever witness onscreen.Your arsenal consists of the aforementioned \"Lancer\" with it\\'s chainsaw bayonet and rapid fire. In fact this weapon\\'ll probably be your best friend through the game (aside from Dom). Rocket-launchers, shotguns, handguns and a \"Torque-Bow\", a bow with explosive tipped arrows, and sticky grenades make for some great weapons. Also the \"Hammer Of Dawn\", a satellite guided laser, proves to be very satisfying to score a kill with. Each weapon looks, sounds and even feels satisfying in every way. Although how could we expect any less from veteran games designer, Epic.You\\'ll meet other soldiers, known as \"Gears\" along the way, including the typical action movie smart-ass Baird, and the simply great Cole \\'train\\'. They\\'ll help you fight through the Horde and provide genuinely helpful cover. Although at times they make rather stupid AI decisions to stand up in front of fire, these miscalculations are few and far between. The overall result feels fine, you\\'ll command your team to an extent, attack, stay back, stick together, but usually it\\'s just good to have the company.Another key game play mechanic to mention is the \"active-reload\". Perhaps one of the more creative aspects of the game, you\\'ll find yourself able to speed up a gun\\'s reload time. Say you\\'ve run low on ammo and want to reload, simply press a button, however, press that same button again while a bar in the top right of the screen lines up with another bar, and you can instantly reload. Faster than usual, with some extra boost to your bullets. A real bonus if you need to make every shot count (and you will on the insane setting.) However, this manoeuvre is a gamble, with a heavy price. If you miss your active reload window, you\\'ll jam the gun, and take even longer to reload than usual. More than enough time for a Locust to hop over the wall and introduce you to his brand new chain saw accessory.The graphics in this game are astounding, you\\'ve really not seen things like this before. I\\'m sure high end PC owners will scoff, but for console enthusiasts, graphics like this are new. Not just cliché graphic designs we hear about every day like \"the water looks nicer\" and \"realistic tree & leaf physics\" but the sheer detail of this game shows how much work has gone into making it feel right.The cinematic soundtrack sets the tone, with recurring themes and motives which help the whole game feel more like a film. That and the camera angle which sweeps in and out with the player so smoothly, Hollywood should hang it\\'s head in shame. The vocal acting does just the job, and although a bit \"typical\" at times, what can you expect from massive space-marine-esk soldiers? \"Bring It On Baby!\"Without giving too much away about the single player campaign, we\\'ll move onto online play. The game\\'s rather basic looking menu provides one of the more fun inclusions - co-op mode. Either online or off, you\\'ll be able to play the whole game with a friend, with them playing as Fenix\\'s right hand man Dominic. Although on the same system this can be fun, over Xbox Live is where it\\'s really at. Meeting up with someone new and making your way through the levels with a new friend is one of the best experiences Xbox live can offer, if not it\\'s reason to be. You\\'ll meet the odd idiot but hey, it\\'s Xbox live right?Then there\\'s the Ranked, Public and Private multiplayer. These take the form of team death matches, pitting four Gears against four Locusts. Neither team\\'s characters possess any special abilities, but it is nice to hear their personalities fleshed out by wise cracks on the Gear\\'s side, and loyalty to the Queen (that\\'s the Locust\\'s Queen) on the Locust side.\"War zone\" is your typical death match with players fighting to the death in teams, \"Execution\" is the same again except you either have to instantly kill your enemy with a close up melee of sorts, or blow them up with one the game\\'s more explosive weapons. \"Assassination\" sees one player as the hand-gun-only toting V.I.P who is to be protected by the other team players, while they seek to kill off the opponent’s own V.I.P.You\\'ll have to choose beforehand however whether you want to play a \"Ranked\" match, against strangers and for points. Or a Public match, against people you know and... well... you don\\'t get points :) What ever you fancy at the time. There\\'s also the option to host a Private match, which is unranked also, but it\\'s unlisted so you can invite whoever you want without random people joining.Overall the single player campaign is a hugely enjoyable experience, and sets you up to take the fight online. Once there you\\'ll be one of the many people who managed to knock the mighty Halo 2 from Xbox Live\\'s most played games list. This is a Next-Gen title in pretty much every way.',\n",

       "   'description': 'Crackdown was released in a time where all open-world genre games were all very similar. It seemed like all of the games were trying to cash in on what the Grand Theft Auto series had created. Luckily for us Crackdown brought something different to the table. Like all other open-world games Crackdown allows the player to explore a city and do whatever they like. But what Crackdown does different is it allows you to develop your characters skills to super-human proportions. Crackdown allows the player to develop in five different areas, strength, agility, driving, shooting and explosives. At first your abilities will be quite minor, but once fully upgraded you’ll be jumping 30 feet in the air and chucking cars with ease. You’ll gain experience by simply completing tasks that relate to the specific field your trying to improve in. If you shoot someone you will gain orbs that will increase your accuracy, if you run over a gang member you’ll drive faster and turn sharper. But you must be careful, if you harm civilians or peacekeepers you will lose experience. Your main objective in the game is to take down the three gangs that rule Pacific City. To do this you will need to take down all the gang generals and bosses. Each boss you defeat will weaken each gang significantly. For example, if you take out a gang’s vehicle expert the gang won’t have as many vehicles guarding the gang’s main boss.Besides the small monologue at the beginning of the game the story is non-existent. Which is disappointing considering the potential it had. The game takes place in a future where all of the world’s police have united to fight crime. They call themselves the Agency. The agents are all genetically modified to perform greater than the average man. Your job will be to rid Pacific City of its three major gangs, the Los Muertos, the Volk and the Shai-gen. You will need to take out the gangs generals to weaken the boss to a state in which you could kill them.One of the most interesting things Crackdown has to offer is its unique graphics. Its cell-shaded 3D graphics give it the look and feel of an old comic book that fits perfectly with the theme of the game. Like all open-world games the frame rate has problems. Cars will pop-in and the game will sometimes just freeze on you. Besides these minor hitches the look of the graphics makes them memorable.The sound in Crackdown is nice. It does what it is expected to do. Nothing more. You wont hear pedestrians having hilarious conversations street, there are no hilarious radio stations to listen to while your driving. But what you will hear is the sound of gunfire, explosions and the clanging of metal against metal.Crackdown is a refreshing look into the open-world genre and proves that it has more potential than just Grand Theft Auto clones. Even though the story is non-existent the gameplay and graphics make up for it. Crackdown is well worth a purchase if you’re a fan of the open-world genre or even comic books.',\n",

       "   'description': \"Criticising GTA4 and all of it's great (and deserved) reviews has become a popular sport among video game contrarians out there. Mostly teenage FPS fans who are jealous of the perfect scores\\xa0GTA4 has gotten and thier\\xa0favorite fast twitch muscle reflex\\xa0 button masher of choice has not. This is an unashamed GTA fanboy's breakdown of the XBox 360's version of \\xa0the best\\xa0in this groundbreaking\\xa0series.Story - Second to none. The tale of Niko Bellic is extremely compelling with player decisions that have a profound effect on the game. You must play the game through twice to get the full experience. I can think of no other game before or since that actually provoked an emotional response from me. I actually regretted some of my actions and vowed to be different on my next play through.Graphics - This is a favorite target for the haters. All I have to say is, walk down the streets of Algonquin and just look around. The size, scope, and detail of the city easily forgives character textures or the odd pop-up. How on earth anyone could find fault with anything graphically in this game when standing on the corner of GTA4's version of Times Square is beyond me.Sound/Voice Acting - The talent and attention to detail is very evident here. The literally hundreds of different voices interacting around the city never ceases to amaze me. The character voice work is excellent as well. To compare the voice work in GTA4 to any other video game would be an insult. Only Bioshock would even be in the conversation. More likely the dialogue in GTA4 would be compared to a feature motion picture.Game play - Terrific. The shooting mechanic has been upgraded and it shows. many complain about the driving. It is fine, they just need to get better at it. The replay value is off the charts. You should be able to get 80+ hours of game play just out of the single player campaign alone. When you add the multi-player facet to the mix you get a ton of entertainment for a mere $60. It boggles the mind that someone will pay that same $60 for a clearly lesser game without complaint but this masterpiece gets constant criticism. Frankly, GTA4 is a bargain at double the price!In conclusion, I fail to see how any gamer can not enjoy the humor, the action, and the engrossing world of Liberty City. Any flaws in the game are more the fault of the 360, rather than the brilliant offering of Rockstar games. When you stop and consider the breadth and depth of this game, I defy anyone to point out a similar experience on any console, anywhere. \",\n",

Each planet you control automatically produces ships that you send to other planets to conquer them. The production rate is proportional to the planet size and the number written on the planet shows how many ships are there.The gameplay is simple: you start with 100 ships on one planet and you have to eradicate your enemy (that usually starts at the opposite corner of the map with the same number of ships). You send your ships to other planets by selecting one of your planets and then selecting the destination. Grey planets are neutral, but still have a number on them; that\\'s the number of ships you have to defeat to control the planet. By default, you send half the ship present on the \"source\" planet, but you can change that percentage by touching the number in the corner of the display.Believe me: it\\'s easier done than said.You have to carefully plan which planet to conquer in your expansion towards enemy territory, because smaller planets usually have minor defenses, but then they are slower to build up ships. You can also select different controlled planets and send fleets from those planets at the same time, for example to overcome the ships on a highly defended planet.Meanwhile, the enemy won\\'t sit down, watching you play; the CPU will send fleets to your planets, destroying your ships and crippling your expansion, so you\\'ll best try to limit the expansion of the enemy and, lastly, strike a blow to his last planet. When the last enemy planet is conquered, you win the map.You are then given the choice of replaying the same map, generate another one or go back to the main menu.There are 10 different difficulty levels to choose from (from Cabin Boy to Grand Admiral) and as you go up in difficulty, the CPU gets smarter, more aggressive and you can no longer see how many ships are on planets you don\\'t control, so there\\'s more uncertainty added to deal with your strategy.There are also different kind of games. In Stealth mode, you can\\'t see what the enemy is doing, so you can\\'t concentrate on attacking specific planets, but you have to spread throughout the galaxy to increase your chances to defeat the enemy. In Vacuum mode, you start with two planets containing 100 ships each and you have a time limit to conquer all the planets; in Beast mode, you start as in Vacuum but have to face a rapid spreading \"beast\" which starts controlling several small planets. The last mode is called 3-Way and pits you against 2 CPUs instead of only one (which is the Classical mode).The graphics are, well, it\\'s a 2D game. The graphics are crisp, the arrows (i.e. your ships) are well rendered, the galaxy background are quite varied and the planets are, well, round .. you know ... ahem. The menu is very accessible, with the icons for difficulty selection and the game modes.The sound is non existing (I mean there\\'s no sound AT ALL!). Look at the bright side: you don\\'t have to plug in your headset to play the game without disturbing surrounding people with crazy sci-fi noises =) Apparently they had some difficulties in adding sound to the iPhone version, so they just left it out, since you can listen to your own preferred music directly from the iPhone while you play.The game is accelerometer-sensitive too, meaning that you can play in landscape mode or in portrait mode and the planets and numbers will be oriented accordingly.The game is quite fun and has its moments when you beat the CPU one split second before he can overcome the defenses on one you your planets; the strategy involved is quite simple at the lowest difficulties, but you have to be careful as you ramp up the CPU, because if you split your forces on slow-producing planets, the enemy can easily conquer your less defended planets and you\\'ll have a hard time in reconstructing your empire while the enemy thrives on.The game has also its problems. First, there are no high-scores tables. Period. Add the fact that there\\'s no story at all, just countless random maps and no ranking system and you probably wonder why the hell you are still playing. Your time to completion is shown each time you complete a map, be it in Classic, Vacuum or any other mode, but the game only keeps track of the best score ever on that game mode, and you can\\'t write your name for bragging rights.There\\'s no online mode too, or local wi-fi or any other way to play against a human being. It\\'s just you and the iPhone processor.The game has its limits and the price tag of € 7,99 ($ 9,99) may be a bit high for casual gamers, but it\\'s a nice game and it seems that the creator is looking into adding multiplayer to the iPhone version (even though not quite soon), so I\\'d suggest you check the shareware version (PC or Mac) first and then decide if it would be a nice addition to you iPhone library.',\n",

It's always making people defend it as if it were some holy grail, and those who haven't experienced it should be shunned and banished to hell. See, the thing is...this game will leave you dazed after playing it, and it really takes a while for you to realize, it's not the greatest thing ever created. The story is complex and quite confusing and the characters are the weirdest bunch of idiots to ever be assembled. But that's the beauty of it.First you have Cloud, the super saiyin that likes BIG swords, Barret who has a knack for losing pieces of his body, Tifa with her big jugs, Cait Sith with his slots of doom, Vincent with his oh so happy smile, Aerith with her cheap flowers, Cid with his flying boats, and that bitch Yuffie who stole all my materia!!! All these characters have a so called limit break that becomes better as you progress, and they unleash devastating powers upon your oh so weak opponents. Although this game's materia system allows for the ultimate level of customization and let's any character do anything, it still makes you sometimes wish that every character was actually unique when you use them. I always felt as if it didn't really matter who the hell i used when it came to materia, the only thing that mattered when it came to character was the fucking insane limit breaks. But that didn't stop me from looking up Tifa's skirt.Anywho the shinra bastards wanna take Aerith's ass away from you, while this dude Sephiroth is being badass running away from you. It all boils down to some weird metaphor that we should stop using up all our oil before we destroy ourselves with nukes because we all want it so bad. Or something like that...probably a coincidence...unless...the creators of Final Fantasy are part of a conspiracy!!  That's right!! Every last one of those bums is keeping all the oil for themselves, so that we nuke eachother!!! The messege is in the Final Fantasy games...Just look at FFX. Yea, that game, like...Sin yo!! Sin is just a metaphor for how we are gonna kill eachother if technology gets too advanced!! It's gonna backfire on us, and we'll be stuck in the Matrix!!!!Check out my Final Fantasy X review for more.\",\n",

       "   'description': 'Never have I been so scared that my motocycle crashed in a parking lot. Why I was scared? \\'Cause I was surrounded in a parking lot filled with over 3,000 zombies (or more) coming towards me.And that\\'s what Dead Rising does so perfectly. DR is Capcom\\'s \"what if you just wanted to kill zombies\" game where you play as a freelance photo-journalist named Frank. Frank hears a rumor that a town is closed by the publich for unknown reason. Frank wants to do a story of it and the only way to go to the town is by stopping at the roof of Willamente Mall (a la Dawn of the Dead). The story isn\\'t as original and it\\'s pretty sad they really copied the DotD plot but Frank\\'s involvement is interesting as you can take pictures of anyone around you. Even take a picture of a female zombie wearing under garments. But the mall story aside, it\\'s really interesting to see how the story will play out. If anyone who played this game, you\\'d know what I mean (hopefully).The gameplay is great. It\\'s really fun and just so addictive of how you can kill a zombie or more. You get the usual guns which does the over-the-shoulder aim like Resident Evil 4. Then you have blunt objects like baseball bats and bowling balls. What\\'s really weird is that you can even kill a zombie with 50 CDs or throw a pack of sodas. The zombie killing is really fun and I would have liked to have a mode in DR where all you do is trying to kill zombies in one specific part of the mall. Now, the missions? Oh gawd. Well, they\\'re okay. Some missions are so easy, some are both easy and hard (which is a good thing), and some borderline will make you so angry and aggravted. One mission in particular is *spoiler*, when you have to put out all the 5 bombs in the parking lot that Carlito made. Trust me, that mission took me 30 tries and you can\\'t do it with just one try. There is side missions which is manly saving people from areas. What\\'s the problem with that? The human A.I. is SO MUCH dumber than the zombie A.I. It\\'s kind of sad that the undead is smarter than the living. I\\'m sure you heard about this a lot so I won\\'t explain why the human A.I. is DEE-DEE-DEE when you try to rescue them. Some side missions where you either carry them or you hold their hand is really easy and you should be thankfull of doing just that. The zombies won\\'t even try to kill you.The side missions will either involve rescues or other \"pyschopaths\" which are basically bosses of the game. The bosses either in the main or side part of the game is really interesting to verse however sometimes they\\'re just to annoying to kill or just to repetive.Now, while the graphics in DR isn\\'t as breathtaking as Gears of War, it\\'s definately impressive. It\\'s impressive because how can the game not lag at all when there\\'s 2,000 or more zombies around you and that you can go to any store with no loading screen and can pick up almost everything without a loading screen. It\\'s insane and I love how Capcom accomplished it.Dead Rising\\'s impressive techinal highlight besides graphics is the sound. The sound is just so awesome. Whoever made the sound effects is genius. I\\'m surprised they didn\\'t have to kill, bludegon, or hurt any human being just to get these beautiful and delicious (what is that approriate?) sound effects. Just listining of Frank hitting a zombie with a baseball hat is amazing. The tilt is probably one of the weakest points of the game. While it is very easy to pick up things, ride vehicles (sometimes), and killing zombies, the most disapointing part is when you try to shoot the gun. I don\\'t know if I should argue but whenever Frank is moving when he\\'s in gun aim, it\\'s all sluggish. Also driving vehicles is very hard to do cause you can\\'t drift, stop fast, and you drive so fast, but overall driving is okay. There\\'s also a problem with the save system where you get to save one, and if you mess up saving at the wrong time and place, you have to start all over again. Which I really was mad, but I read that Capcom did it purpose so that, \"The player would know that he made a bad choice along the way\". Good enough for me. By the way, why does this game and Lost Planet\\'s written text suck? It\\'s so small and I had to go really close to my TV to read what Otis or Brad is saying on the text box. Ugh.When you complete the 72 Hour Mode (the right way), you go to Overtime Mode which I did not beat. You know why? Well I\\'m not a noob and I really tried hard to beat it but I just couldn\\'t. Plus I felt ripped off that *spoiler* \"Ohh all the zombies are now gone, now I can go the helicopter. Oh wait, now I have to stay in this mall again but with a time limit and a load of missions that I actually have to do. Oh and they\\'re are zombies again. How did this happen?\" So I couldn\\'t bother. Then after you beat Overtime Mode, there\\'s a mode where you basically have to kill zombies while still trying to stay alive which my friend told me is annoying. I can\\'t really rate the 3rd mode, so blah.Overall, Dead Rising has some major flaws but those flaws\\xa0can be\\xa0shadowed because of how fun and\\xa0addictive the gameplay is.',\n",

       "   'description': 'When Halo 3 was released in September of 2007, it was instantly met with a flood of praise. Reading the initial reviews, one would expect the game to be the absolute pinnacle of what a first-person shooter could accomplish, which unfortunately inflates the game to a level that is impossible for it to live up to. However, evaluating the game solely on its own merits, without the flashy soundbites offered by innumerable gaming websites and magazines, it\\'s still a fantastic game; certainly not the absolute best FPS ever made, but definitely the one of the best total packages available.The developers at Bungie always championed their Halo design as thirty seconds of fun spread out and repeated throughout an entire game. Halo 3 doesn\\'t do anything to change that mentality, but rather refines it to near perfection. Unlike a game like Call of Duty 4, Halo 3 isn\\'t all action all the time. On the flip side, it rarely relies on mood-creating setpieces like Mars City in Doom 3 or Rapture in Bioshock to heighten the atmosphere of the game. That being said, there is a lot of action, but once each battle is finished, you just walk the Master Chief along a linear path until the next big action setpiece occurs.While all the levels of the single player campaign are pretty short, Bungie packs a lot of variety almost every part of the campaign. The first level opens with what looks to be a small skirmish, but quickly escalates as Covenant backup arrives to reinforce their allies. Two or three of these battles occur before the player is introduced to grenades, when they immediately get thrust into a larger battle against a superior force with higher ground. Rather than escalate any further, Bungie opts for the next skirmish to take place in a dense jungle, with Covenant snipers in the trees. The player can certainly go in all guns blazing, but a smarter approach is to identify enemies, take cover, and attack them individually rather than en masse. In less than thirty seconds, the level design has changed enough to warrent a wildly different approach to a situation.By far the biggest action setpieces in the game are the vehicle battles, of which there are MANY. They\\'re all a ton of fun, but often far too easy, with only a few standing out as even mildly difficult. However, they\\'re an excellent change of pace and the eye candy is astonishing. Aside from the vehicle segments\\' lack of difficulty, the only other real complaint that can be made is that the player is often pigeonholed into a set path or a particular tactic. The Scarab battles being the exceptions, as the player can take down the behemoth in a number of ways, but the other battles frequently have the \"right way\" and the \"take-this-path-and-your-Ghost-will-be-blown-to-smithereens-by-three-Wraiths way.\"The entire campaign can be beaten easily in a few hours, unless you play on Heroic or Legendary, which require that the player take a little more caution when dealing with large groups. That\\'s not to slight the campaign for its length, as it\\'s infinitely replayable (especially with the use of Skull modifiers) and the checkpoint sytstem allows it to be played for as much or as little time as the player can allow.Equally important to the game is the extensive multiplayer mode. The game offers 4 player split screen multiplayer in a wide range of gametypes as well as the ability to take your friends online to XBox Live and compete with people around the world. There\\'s also a great 4-player co-op mode, either locally or over Live, that is a ton of fun although the addition of extra people dramatically decreases the length of the campaign.Rounding out the package are two additions that many players might choose to ignore, but that are a lot of fun in their own right. The Forge mode allows players to modify item placement and in some cases the layout of the multiplayer maps included with the game. They can\\'t alter the terrain, but through the clever use of items, new paths throughout the levels can be created while others are entirely blocked off. The Theater mode allows people to watch the replays of their multiplayer games as well as the single player campaign levels, freely moving the camera around the environments to record video from the replay or capture screenshots of particularly cool moments.Halo 3 doesn\\'t reinvent the wheel, but it doesn\\'t pretend to either. The gaming press may have put it on a pedestal when it was released, but now that almost a year has gone by the game stands just as strong on its own merits. A replayable campaign and wildly enjoyable multiplayer options guarantee the game to get more than a few spins in your XBox 360.',\n",

       "   'description': 'Infinity Ward gladly realizes World War II games are starting to become boring. So after Call of Duty 2, work began on the sequel on modern warfare. There was Call of Duty 3 which there didn\\'t had to be and plus it wasn\\'t made by them. It\\'s odd that Infinity Ward didn\\'t make a brand new franchise just for this modern-themed war game but whatever the case, Call of Duty 4 is great.The single-player is short, with the length half as long as most first-person shooters like Half-Life 2 or Halo 3. What makes up for the short single-player is the story. You play 2 characters, one from S.A.S. (British), and the U.S. Marines. There\\'s other supporting characters, one of them you get to play in a mission set years before the actual story-line. The story is better and consistent, you truly feel you\\'re in a battle of a great story, and not playing someone who\\'s in a famous WW2 battle. From start to finish, you\\'ll never know what will happen next and who knows you\\'ll survive. It\\'s an adrenaline-pumped thrill ride borrowing elements from 24 or The Kingdom involving action and politics, and this game does so well. One of the best missions is where you only have a pistol and a sniper rifle along with only 1 team-mate. You and your team-mate have to go through the entire mission without alerting people, you could but you\\'ll be outnumbered. It\\'s a chilling experience and it makes you really feel like you\\'re doing some tactical. There\\'s not a lot of replayability to the single-player unless you want to play it on the hardest difficulty, or Arcade Mode which is interesting like Halo 3\\'s. The multi-player is where Infinity Ward focused and it is okay but really repetitive.\\xa0 You could create your own character not by his appearance but by his set of weapons, and perks/abilities. All the weapons are fairly balanced to say the least but the perks are sort of... off. It\\'ll take more to kill someone with a \"Juggarnaut\" perk (extra health), grenade launchers, and one perk\\xa0that I\\xa0hate is \"Martydom\" which is where a person who dies, in a second a live grenade explodes in the location of his/her dead body. It\\'s annoying and it ruins the fun; you could barely avoid it most of the time because you are so caught up with the combat that you forget that a live grenade is about to set off next to a dead body near by.\\xa0Shanking is a pretty cool element of stealth and close-range combat. The multi-player\\xa0has other\\xa0problems besides the perks themselves. It tests your patience hard and asking too much. You have to pay attention to everywhere you go, which I like, it gives you a great feeling of intensity. But there are instances where you die for an unfair reason even if there\\'s a KIll-Cam. There\\'s also really bad spawns, where you die instantly from campers, enemies, airstrikes, helicoptors, grenades, turrets and other stuff that\\'s going on. So much stuff going on isn\\'t a good thing all the time. With that said, the multi-player is sub-par, but please consider the problems I\\'ve listed. It could be avoidable,\\xa0maybe it can\\'t be avoiable. But\\xa0you\\'ve been warned. The graphics are superb, in instances in the single-player you\\'ll see the range from a sniping point to the rest of the town, and it\\'s beautiful. The multi-player is toned down a bit, but still looks really impressive. The sound is the best, you hear gun sounds far away or next to, characters screaming, grenades, cars blowing up, helicoptors and airstrikes makes you feel like you\\'re in battle. The tilt\\xa0\\xa0can be maneurvered nicely,\\xa0and the first-person view changes if anything happens to you. If stunned, you move slower. If you need cover fast, the corners of the screen have blood vessels shown here. If you fall off a big height, you hear a cracking sound and a black blink on the screen. It\\'s great to see Infinity Ward paid attention to little things like that. Overall, Call of Duty 4 is without the doubt the best of the series, the single-player might not last long but it\\'s so deep, story and gameplay wise,\\xa0you\\'ll love how it goes from start to finish even if... well see yourself. I On top of that is\\xa0some good\\xa0multi-player which actually is enjoyable at spots, but rarely you see you and your friends just having a private match and not going online. If you\\'re a COD fan I guess get it but for those late to the COD party be warned, it\\'s hell like war.',\n",

After the kidnapping Desmond is laid down on a machine known as the animus where his sub conscious relays images from the third crusades. While in these images he sees you are instructed to assassinate 11 influential figures during the third crusades after doing so you complete the game only to be left wondering what’s next. The battle system in assassin’s creed is strung together quite well, when attacking an opponent you have the option of a proper old fashion sword/dagger fight or either creep up to the enemy and perform a stealth kill with a nice looking dagger/knife. When fighting a group or single enemy you will fight with a sword, dagger or throwing knifes the combat is initiated with one button while you are locking on that specific opponent. The defensive side to the fights are quite well done, you can either Block an attack if you time it right or evade the attack, after which your character will kill the enemy or either kick or punch them to the ground. The graphics in assassin’s creed are quite well done; the buildings and surrounding landscapes are very nicely polished. All four cities are all individual with different artistic style due to the fact they are based on real cities of the time but they do a very nice job in capturing what I can only imagine they would have looked like. AI in this game is very nice they all interact with their surroundings react to you if you manage to bump into them or push them over while on lookers will gasp and even sometimes run (pussies). From the bustling streets of the cities where you will hear every noise from a screaming women down to the whispers of peasants. The audio plays a great role in telling the story and drawing you in to the story; the voice acting is done well and compliments what is a solid game. Overall I was happy with my time spent playing assassins creed it definitely taught me a thing or too about the third crusades well maybe not so much. I say to you if you have the time and money it’s a game worth buying. \\xa0',\n",

       "   'description': \"Thanks to the wonders of DOSBOX, even the most cutting edge modern computers can play TIE Fighter. It's a little odd, isn't it? The game came out over ten years ago, yet without that little wonder application, a rig that can run Crysis in its sleep would be unable to load up this gourad-shaded, jagged polygonal gem.TIE Fighter has more in common with old school WWII flight sims like Chuck Yeager's Air Combat than later Star Wars flight sims like the Rogue Squadron series. Whereas its precursor, X-Wing, put you in the cockpit of the Alliance's trademark starfighter, here you get to fly the significantly weaker TIE series. While the lower models of TIEs may go up in flames easier, they're vastly more maneuverable than their Rebel counterparts, and you'll want your throttle up to 100% on most of these missions.Whereas in the Rogue Squadron games controls were simplified to just flying and shooting, TIE Fighter gives you control over all the different options in your craft. If you can hold missiles, you get to choose which ones via a weapon loadout, you control the exact percentage of your engine that you want to use, you can even reroute some of your laser power to your shields (if the craft is shield equipped) and vice versa. Being attacked from behind? Put full shield power to the rear. It's not simple by any means, but it gives you a level of control that's no longer present in combat flight sims.Of course, it's also a ton of fun. The music accompanying your missions is undeniably imperial, and your objectives are often downright nasty. In addition to the main goals of each mission there are a number of secondary and tertiary objectives that help you earn medals, and that's to say nothing of the secret objectives you're often given by the Emperor or his guards.While the gameplay and audio are great, the visual presentation is undeniably the weakest aspect of the game. It's barely even a incremental step up from X-Wing and it's quite the eyesore nowadays. The blocky, largely colorless presentation often makes it difficult to tell what type of ship is in your sights before you collide. Luckily, the targeting system helps out in that regard by showing your target in a full 3D model in your cockpit HUD.You can get this for dirt cheap these days on Amazon or EBay, so there's no reason not to check it out if you're interested. Just don't forget to download DOSBOX as well, or it'll all be for nothing.\",\n",

       "   'description': \"First i played the demo for Penumbra: Black Plague, after completely the demo I loved it and decided that I would play the first chapter before I played black plague.   All I can say is wow the game is great. There I said it! This is what a horror game should be. The basic story line is that your after your mother passes away you recieve a letter from your dead father, which leads you to greenland, once there you realise what a harsh climate you are in and take cover in a mine, which is where the game really begins. The game play is great, you use the mouse to collect objects, swing weapons and interact with the environment (by that I mean opening doors, picking up barrels etc) there is a hand on the screen which replaces your cursor and it is a representation of your actual in game hand, but it is the use of the mouse that really gets you immersed in this game, picture this, you hear a noise on the other side of the door, its your only way forward, you slowly approach the door and grab the door, now depending on whether you push the mouse forward hard or soft will depend on how fast or slow the door opens (the same applies for where you grab the door; grab it close to the hinges and you will need to use more force, but grab it closer to the handle and it will be easier) this adds to the suspense because you can slowly open the door peaking inside to make sure the way forward is clear or you can swing the door open and just deal with it. The sound also is great, it helps set suspense and drama where needed and help indicate where the creatures are, and any good horror game needs to have effective sound and this game hit the nail on the head.  The only negatives of this game I found are that it is too short; completed the game in around 6-7 hours, but you could argue quality over quantity because they are 7 hours well spent. The graphics are not up to scratch, poor backgrounds and blocky creatures are not appealing although when you are crawling through a spider infested crawl space it will still scare you. Another problem is that although the controls fit the puzzle and interacting elements well, I wish I could say the same about the fighting, which involves holding down the mouse button to ready your weapon and then moving the mouse left, right or forward to swing, and although it sounds good it doesn't work well, and in a game where all it takes is around 3 hits to die you can't afford to miss swings. The last negative point is that once you have completed the game there is no incentive to go through it again.  Overall: This is a great survival game, if you are a fan of survival games then this should be played, if however you don't play horror/survival games then this is unlikely to change your mind but the puzzle and interactive elements definitely add to your immersion in this game. Although the graphics could be better and it is on the short side you won't find a game with such as good combination of game play and amazing sound. (except maybe the sequel)\",\n",

       "   'description': \"Battlefield is one of those games that are beloved by many PC gamers and held in such high regard that to consider putting the game on a console is blaspheme, but they rest easy when I tell you that this game is fantastic. I held off buying this game on launch day because a part of me always thought this game wouldn't be any good but boy was I wrong. The single player is great and has a fulfilling story as well as some remember able characters who exchange some witty dialogue, through out the game you grow fond of the rest of B company and genuinely care about them (not that they can die though, because they can't) A great feature of this game is the destructible environment where a lot of the terrain and buildings can be damaged. Don't want to go around the corner because of an enemy tank? Then don't, pull your grenade launcher out and go through the building. It really does add a whole new way of going about a level. This leads me on to my next point, the explosions in the this game are incredible, they may not look as good as mercenaries 2 but they certainly are impressive; from blowing holes in the walls to shoot strategically placed barrels, this game has a great array of explosions and each one makes you look on in awe.  Now the multiplayer is where the true meat is at, those of you who have played COD4 will fit in like a glove here; you have your basic rank up system which is very welcome, as well as a system where you collect dog tags, patches and wild cards which require you do complete certain actions to obtain them. The maps are huge and are varied enough to make each one feel unique, but at the moment there is only one mode available which requires you to either defend or attack gold crates, but I for one think its great because it rewards team work far more than a basic death match would.   Now for the negative points. The first is that sometimes the game can suffer from 'black' syndrome (no I am not being racist, it is a reference to a last gen game), where by there are lots of barrels and explosive boxes which are a convenient red colour, the problem with these is that it can sometimes make you feel like if you aren't blowing up walls etc then you are playing the game wrong, where they are placed so sparingly that it is harder to try to avoid hitting them than actually try, but this is easily forgiven seeing as the game definitely has the destruction as a key element of the game play. Another negative point is that there are certain 'extra' weapons that can only be accessed through buying the gold edition of the game, visiting battlefield.com or reaching level 4 in the demo first, but the weapons on offer are not incredibly better so it isn't such a big deal. This leads me on to one problem with the environment and that is why can we not shoot through thin walls? The thing is, I understand that the thick walls cannot be blown down but why are we unable to shoot through a fence? When you consider that environmental destruction is such as large part of the game it doesn't make sense that they wouldn't incorporate this idea into the final product.  Now I will discuss achievements. There your basic achievements such as complete level X on medium/hard (although if you want to get both you will have to complete the game twice because you don't get the achievement for medium is you part on hard), there are also achievements such as collect x number of collectable, plus X number of gold. And others such as kill 25 enemies, climb to the highest point of the game and then some multiplayer ones such as reach rank x and collect 50 dog tags, so basic stuff then really.  Overall I would definitely recommend this game. Great single player and very involving multiplayer make this a complete package, even if you love COD4 this a welcome change with some great vehicle combat.\",\n",

In the opening cut scene you,with your adviser and royal guard (and general), and find an abandoned city.\\xa0 The city\\'s Crystal, strangely, can talk and grants you the Magic of Architek which not only brings buildings into existence but summons back citizens from your former home.\\xa0 However after building a few buildings the crystal runs out elementite which powers it.\\xa0 The game then revolves around hiring and commissioning adventures to explorer, and find elementite in the surrounding dungeons.\\xa0 This allows you to rebuild the city and uncover the mystery of why the there is the freaky talking crystal and what happened to your father.Game PlayYou play as the king running around town and talking to citizens, shop owners, and adventurers.\\xa0 On glowing plots of land you can shake your wii-mote to summon your adviser Chyme, to build new buildings.\\xa0 Each morning you review the reports of the adventurers and the financial choices you made the day before.\\xa0 You are then able to make requests (commissions) for the adventurers which are then posted on bulletin boards throughout the town. These commission include, explorer this dungeon, defeat this monster, and find this object.\\xa0 Talking to adventures and townsfolk raises your moral bar which when fills moral spheres which can be spent at the castle to upgrade your town, or to \"raise moral\".\\xa0 When you raise moral you temporally gain the ability to give adventures stat bonuses when you talk to them and to improve your townsfolk relationships with their family.\\xa0 Lastly during the day you can talk to the shopkeepers and fund research for items, which they will sell to the adventures.Add-on ContentThe most controversial aspect of the this game is the add-on content\\xa0 which triples the cost of the game.\\xa0 If you do not buy any add-on content you only have access to humans (clavat) and cannot get the final house upgrade.\\xa0 For 8 dollars you can add on dungeons which, upon completion, will give you access build houses with will summon back the other races that made the Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles universe so unique and enjoyable.Other add-on content unlocks things that makes the game easier, such as shrines which can give the adventures boosts even when they are in \"the field\".OpninionsI found this game incredibly addictive, but frustratingly easy.\\xa0 The game is entirely story driven, so there are no real penalties for your adventures loosing a fight, it only slows down the stories progression.\\xa0 It is very fun to develop the\\xa0 town into a thriving metropolis.\\xa0 The graphis are quite beautiful, though cartoony, but that actually adds to their charm.\\xa0 After about an hour of play though, I tended to drift off into grinding days, commissioning adventures and then immediately calling for the days end.\\xa0 Still I really enjoyed this game and its music and am starting a second play through.As far as the add-on content goes I bought all of it.\\xa0 It adds a lot of enjoyment to the game because it expands the universe so much.\\xa0 I do not think I would have enjoyed the game even half as much without it.\\xa0 But to get the full experience you only really need to the races bundle pack.',\n",

The game features long on targetting and automatic jumping. You can't use certain items as young or adult Link because of his size and you can go back\\xa0 and forth in time which is needed. You are helped by Navi who is a guide but man she can be annoying at times. The dungeons are very nicely designed and take a key item in the dungeon like the arrows are important to defeating the boss in the Forest Temple. Speaking of the bosses they are huge. They can be difficult and some can cause some serious damage. There are some difficult puzzles to do in certain dungeons. In some you need different coloured tunics to get through. A blue tunic will help you breathe underwater and a red one for fire protection. The balance of this game is perfectThe sound is fantastic Nintendo did a wonderful job with the sound. The opening sounds fantastic and the sounds played on the Ocarina are very well ocartrested. It sounds perfect and the music does feel lovely to listen to. The graphics are equally as impressive the amount of detail in this gane is sensational thinking this is an N64 title. From the moment you set foot on Hyrule Field it is a moment Zelda fans will never for get.It should take you 15 to 20 to complete if you aren't gonna do any of the sidequests or look around for extra heart pieces or just to look around to see what you can see or just to witness the beautiful\\xa0 setting its just simply hard to describe. So overall this is an absolutely fantastic title. The game has so much to offer it is an epic quest and has a fantastic story full of magical moments. If you have never played this game you should. Simple reason is it is just a masterpiece.\",\n",

       "   'description': \"Coming from the success that was Devil May Cry 3, Capcom didn't waste any time and bring us this amazing game. Devil May Cry 4 is everything the fans wanted, it has great graphics, a big and nice variety of moves and weapons and, well, it's got style! As usual, you will be going through small rooms that are sealed until you defeat everybody, then some cutscenes, then some puzzle solving, then cutscene, then more battles Altough this sounds boring, the controls work so fine and ripping your enemies is so satisfing that won't even realize that you're doing the same thing all over again. The story is pretty lame, but the addition to a new playable character, Nero, brings a new life into the franchise. Don't worry, you will be playing with Dante as well, but Nero has got this Devil Arm, that's just too much fun! Bring the enemies close to you (and going close to them, sometimes) saves a lot of time and trouble walking towards them. With Dante, you don't have the Devil Arm, but he's stronger and faster and he's got some old familiar moves from the past games, and of course, new devilish weapons. You will switch characters in the middle of the game, but here's the weakest point of the game: It's like you'll go all the way to the final cenario with Nero, and then you'll just go all the way back from where you started the game, with Dante.You'll fight the same bosses, but at least there are some new enemies. The voice acting sounds great for everybody, but the rock songs are kinda boring and repetitive. The controls are pretty much the same of the last game, but the graphics are simply amazing! The PC version runs pretty smoothly even if your pc is not the generation's best and it has some new content, like a Turbo Mode, that speeds a little up the things and a new challenge where you'll fight hundreds of enemies.Finishing comments: For every fan of the games, Devil May Cry 4 stands as one of the series' best. The addition of Nero is very welcome and we will miss the Devil Arm in the next\\xa0 games (if capcom do not put him again, that is). With a satisfing way of finishing your enemies like few games and great graphics and action sequences, Devil May Cry 4 is one of the best action games of the year. You did it again, Capcom!\",\n",

This is a port of a Gamecube game released in the States and Japan. A lazy one at that.The game's story is typical Harvest Moon; you get a farm. Now live your life. There is also an interesting sub-plot involving a Harvest Goddess and notes you are rewarded for completing tasks.Normally, you are taught what to do, introduced to the villagers, given some seeds, a dog, and maybe a cow to start off... but in this game you are quite literally dumped right in the thick of it; no tutorials, no preparation, just left in front of your house with a dog you didn't even ask for. No barn, seeds or anything; just you. No amount of 'very's can describe how unfriendly this game is.After either figuring out what to do (in which case you are either a genius or a die-hard Harvest Moon fan) or jumping on to the computer for help (which is far more likely), the game's vortex starts to suck you in.You have a number of choices: you can buy some seeds, grab your hoe and watering can, and build a vegetable empire, mine for treasure with your hammer in the local cave, fish for your dinner or start making friends and searching for a wife. You can't buy any animals at the beginning for two reasons: you have very little money and/or need to buy a barn.The socialising aspect is very important; making friends yields items, a wider choice of property, or more people coming to your village. In this game, nice guys win everything. The other aspects can be slightly infuriating, thanks to the over complicated menu and shoddy motion controls, which don't work when you need them and do when you don't, deplenishing the stamina bar, another poor addition, causing you to faint.All in all, though, Magical Melody is a game that, despite its major flaws, will keep you coming back for more time and time again.\",\n",

       "   'description': \"Capcom's remake renaissance continues in this generation of consoles with 1942: Joint Strike, a new game based from the 80s 194x series of World War II shumps. For ten dollars, or 800 Microsoft Points, you're getting a HD facelift, five levels, and pure old-school gaming in terms of no saving and memorization of enemy fire patterns. This new entry does have that same 1942 feel you expect and that's good enough for fans to enjoy it. If you're not in it for the nostalgia, getting high scores, or achievements, you're not going to get much of Joint Strike for more than a day. This is just another example of a good XBLA game that can be played in short bursts when you're tired of other games and not meant for a long stretch like other XBLA games.Like the title, Joint Strike, this new 1942 plays differently with two players than doing it solo. Three planes are selectable when you start up a run that differ by stats of health, missiles, and speed which allows for different styles of gameplay. The three pick-up weapons also cater to different styles with spread fire, machine-gun fire, and lasers, which is neat too. As a shump, it can be challenging even at the normal difficulty as several enemy shots can take you out pending on which plane you used. The difficulty scale depends on the number of lives you start wish and how aggressive the bosses will be. Speaking of bosses, there isn't much variety to the bosses and the enemy set, which is kind of expected for a game like this, but be prepared for some repetition of enemy ships or fighting the same boss twice with a different twist the second time. Also similar to an old-school shump, once you run out of lives, its game over and you have to start over from the beginning which is not bad being five stages, but the frustration will kick in once you're close towards beating it. I also like the multiplier system for Joint Strike in which the closer you kill enemy ships, the more multiplier of points you get. Along with missiles (single-player only) and bombs if you're in a tight situation, the Joint Strikes are the main reason this game is meant to be played on co-op with another player locally or online with different attacks like a joint shot or a chain of lightning which allows more ways of taking out the opposition. Speaking of online, it runs smoothly from what I played with minimal lag, but it doesn't mean you might run into some disconnects at random times.As for the graphics, 1942: Joint Strike looks good for a shump in this generation of consoles. The bloom and World War II-like filtering may be distracting for some players. Other than that, the game runs smoothly with rare cases of slowdown. Presentation-wise, Capcom and Backbone nailed the World War II theme with the look of the planes, the sounds and music, as well as the environments of the skies, a seaport, forests, and a city in ruins. Other than that, Joint Strike looks great keeping the 1942 spirit along with the HD facelift.As another HD remake for Capcom, 1942: Joint Strike delivers on that front of retaining what was great in the old 194x games gameplay-wise along with the improved graphics. While it is a short game and can be beaten in less than a hour, the challenge is there along with the replay value of beating it with the three different planes and the four difficulties (Wing King being the hardest). Other than leaderboards and achievements ranging from getting lots of medals (that are picked up during the action like the old games), to getting a high score for completing the game, Joint Strike won't be your XBLA rotation for too long after getting all of them. The online co-op is great as the recommended way to play with the Joint Strike special abilities even though single-player can be a blast alone. Of course there are better shumps in Xbox Live Arcade, but this new 1942 is worth checking out if you're a fan of the genre and the franchise in the 80s.Pros:Has the 1942 feel nailed downCo-op is the recommended way to play this game with the ability to do Joint StrikesHas enough replay value with different planes and difficultiesGreat in short burstsCons:Short game (can be beaten in less than a hour)The bloom effects and WWII filtering might be distracting for some playersRepetitive boss battles and enemy sets\",\n",

For all it's innovations the game still consists of the same missions as all the GTAs, only in this game there is less ground to race over and less vehicles and ways to do so. But this is all for the sake of refinement; I hear you shout. Granted, crossing the deserts in San Andreas was a pain, but it was the sense of epic that made it fun. Spawning a jet and dogfighting your way to murder someone with a dildo was massive fun, what\\xa0 I wanted was more of the same, only bigger and better.Oh and the multiplay is horrific. Clunky to operate, derivative gametypes, less freedom than I'd have expected and the worst community on anything I've ever played lead to a terrifying experience that shouldn't have been attempted.Overall though, I will say the story and characters are fantastic, and I won't bash the driving, after completing all the races a dozen time I like the new system as much as the old. I loved GTA4 and so will you, I'm glad this game has been made, but now the dust has settled from the frenzy of hype on release, and I wish rockstar made the GTA I love and left realism to someone else. I simply don't think anyone can carry the baton like Rockstar could.\",\n",

I suppose the background is perfect to show the contrast between the colorful scenery, and the darkness and gloominess of what's actually happening to you, which has a bizarre effect on you, instilling a feeling you can almost associate with claustrophobia. Why no 10? Because I, like many, had to play this game on a standard television. No high-def to be found within the confines of this abode, I simply can't afford it. You can imagine my frustration when having to squint and struggle to read messages that are vital to your progression. The audio: 9.0The audio is amazing in this game. The elevator music-style jingles playing throughout the mall compliment the gut-wrenching sounds of busting heads, slicing flesh, and spurting blood. The distant rock music that starts playing when you enter the park area almost makes you stop and realize the frantic situation you're in, and make you really feel like you're completely alone with no one to help you...but then you just proceed to kick soccer balls at zombies' heads and laugh about it too. Gameplay: 7.0This game has a lot of potential, and is still really good, when you're roaming around just finding things to beat zombies over the head with. The problems occur when you go to save, or start a mission. The Save system almost seems like it's there just to taunt me, I mean, what were they thinking?? One save slot, and that's it. By the way, the game's story mode runs in real-time, meaning you have to get to each mission, side quest or main, on time. If you save, without realizing you've got 30 seconds to get to the next story mission, you've got a big problem. If you miss a story mission, the rest of the story is impossible to get to. That's right newcomers, I said it. If you're late for a mission, you cannot proceed, and must load your save file to continue playing the game, but OH NO, you f*&%cked up because you had 30 seconds to reach that mission when you saved, and the quest-giver is at the other end of the massive mall. So guess what? You have to restart from the beginning. At least the developers had the courtesy to let you keep your characters stats when you restart, so you're not a complete whelp all over again, but if you're actually in this situation, this feature is hardly appreciated. After being late for missions several times, I basically stopped playing the game, maybe mid-way through the campaign. But that's more than enough to write a review on everything except the story, which I wouldn't spoil any way even though it's not exactly compelling. This game is good, but it's exactly that. Just good. If the gameplay mechanics remained, but the save and quest systems were just a little more forgiving, it would be fantastic! The chances of a re-release for the 360 are slim, which disappoints me (If you own a Wii you're in luck. The upcoming Wii version promises to address a lot of these issues) . It's a little hard to recommend a purchase, since despite being an older game, it's not that cheap. I got my copy new for 40 bucks slightly before christmas of '07. So yeah, if you're still interested in this game ,which you probably should be, give it a rent.\",\n",

       "   'description': 'Positive: - great graphics - excellent sound effects and voice acting - animated cutscenes look very nice - controls are sharp and work perfectly - full of lovable personality - dialogue is hilarious every minute of the game - great quality overall - Negative: - a couple annoying camera quirks here and there - Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is definitely an awesome game. With quality around every corner, witty dialogue, great voice acting, excellent graphics and sound, and fun gameplay, Rayman 3 is a true winner both within its own franchise and the whole gaming world. Before you even start to play this game, you will notice just how high the quality is. The introductory cutscene (before the title screen) is awesome. Then you get to the title screen, and in the background it flies around the game\\'s first level! Then you get to the menu, which is pretty cool and fits the game perfectly. But then you start the actually game... The story in Rayman 3 is really funny. It starts off with Andre the black lum (a little black fuzzy ball with little wings) flying around turning the red lums (little red balls with wings) into an army of more black lums so he can take over the world! His lums then become hoodlums and he starts off on his quest to the heart of the world. Then you find Rayman, peacefully asleep, when a guy named Murphy (I don\\'t actually know what he is, he\\'s green, pretty small, and has a full body and can fly) comes and starts him off on his adventure. After getting your hands back from Globox (Rayman\\'s blue, funny friend), you give chase to Andre as he makes his way to the heart of the world. However, after a couple levels, a cutscene plays and Andre flys straight into Globox\\'s mouth and gets stuck in the blue man\\'s stomach. The game then turns into a quest to find a doctor who can cure Globox. However, each doctor refers you to another doctor until the fourth, where all the four doctors join forces and get Andre out at last. Then, Andre sets out to take over the world and destroy Rayman because the group failed to contain him after his exit from Globox\\'s body, and so Rayman sets out to stop him... again. So the story is pretty different than you\\'d expect, but the main part of it is just how funny it is, and the superb voice acting and hilarious cutscenes make it enjoyable every step of the way. Rayman 3 has some pretty memorable levels to go along with the story. The highlight of the game for me is definitely the part at the Desert of the Knaaren. I really feel that I should go off on this for a little bit, I just love this part of the game! The Knaarens are invincible monsters that live in caves in this desert where (for some reason) the fourth doctor\\'s office is, and Rayman encounters several of these that he must either run away from or stealtily get past, and this part of the game feels so tense and epic, it\\'s just awesome! These creatures are always saying things like \"Fresh brain!\" or \"tear off his flesh!\" which really scare and startle you every once in awhile, adding a cool effect to that whole part of the game. This area\\'s boss battle is pretty awesome as well, as Rayman takes down the undefeated arena champion, Reflux, who is pretty much 10 times his size. Rayman 3 is also a good game aside from its sense of humor: the gameplay is excellent as well. Moving Rayman around somehow feels much better than it did in Rayman 2, and the limbless hero actually throws his fists this time instead of stupid balls of energy like in the game\\'s predecessor. The game is fun to play overall and the controls are also sharp and work to perfection to help the gameplay. The enemy targeting system is nice and once you figure it out (which doesn\\'t take long) is rarely frustrating and works just fine.To vary the gameplay a bit, there are also different temporary abilities Rayman can get from cans that enemies drop upon defeating them. They do things like give Rayman a huge amount of power, shoot a guided missle, or fly a bit. These make the gameplay more fun and add the icing to the cake of Hoodlum Havoc\\'s gameplay. Rayman 3 excels in the area of visuals as well. The graphics don\\'t always look perfect, but they certianly look nice and sharp. The fully animated cutscenes also look great. My personal favorite things about Rayman 3 really revolve around the game\\'s superb sound. The sound effects add so much to the game as does the music, putting the perfect feel into the environments and events. My real favorite thing in this area has definitely been mentioned at least three times in this review already: the voice acting. I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever heard of a platformer that has done better in this area. You\\'d have to be a really hard person to please if you don\\'t laugh at the people like Globox, the doctors, or Andre. And I was also sad when Murphy stays behind after the game\\'s first few levels, that guy was totally hilarious. The voice acting is a big part of Hoodlum Havoc that keeps you laughing and holds your interest all the way through. Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is really an excellent game. It\\'s pure fun with quality all around. I\\'d recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Rayman 2 or anyone who wants to just have a good time with a game. I think Hoodlum Havoc has a lesson for all of us to learn and accept: not all great games get sequels. Gameplay: 9Graphics: 9Sound: 10Value: 9(this does not necessarily affect the overall score)',\n",

The driving is fast and exhilirating, Paradise City itself is simple gorgeous and burnout fans will love it, while Average Joe will be entertained.My problem is the air of falseness hanging over this title like a choking smog. The constant \" If only you had an Xbox 360 Camera(tm) then this would be so much better\" and \"Playing online and gaining rivals is really awesome, try it out now\" make this game much damper than it should be.The n00b friendly tutorials wind me up, as do watching the same, unskippable animations when I pick a car or finish an event. But worst of all is DJ Atomika. EAs attempt to communicate with the kids using a cheesy voice failed, his constant gibbering driving me to the point of insanity. His obnoxious jives when you lose anything and spoon feeding every drop of non-sequential info is so irritating I have knocked a star of just for that.The other star has been dropped for some shoddy gameplay. Paradise City is really just urban and rural, I\\'d have liked more variety, even Cars managed that. And I feel the whole town would have more personality with an active day system and history. The only character is DJ f***ing Atomika, and the only reference to the town is a reference to the cheap mayor not repairing potholes. It should have been more like GTA, with pedestrians, radios and self humour. How about explaining why half the town is private property on top of a train station and why ramps are everywhere. Why not have traffic updates when I showtime myself $1.5 millions worth of destruction.They could have thrown in more game-types while they\\'re at. The handful all take place on just about the same roads, finishing all events is an exercise in mindless repetition. Paradise is a great game and has all the material for a generous 4.5, but shoving stuff down my throat and oh-so-annoying faults smear this game all over.',\n",

       "   'description': \"If you're a fan of strategy RPGs, this is one of the games your collection can't do without. The grand scale of things in this game is just breathtaking, whether it be the colossal maps (sometimes spanning an entire country) or the endless number of enemies you face.   Where to start, where to start. For the sake of the review, I'll start with gameplay. As I said before, the game is just epic. The maps you explore will always take up about 20 screens, with the exception of the prologue. In the second chapter (first if you don't count the prologue), you invade an entire country. Aside from the epic scale of the game, all the elements come together perfectly. You control a small army (which eventually grows to about 25 or so characters), saving villages, killing enemies and conquering castles in what would seem like a normal strategy RPG. However, if a character dies in battle, they remain dead, thus giving you more incentive to keep all your characters alive. Another nice feature is the love system. Letting two characters of opposite gender stand next to each other long enough will result in the two falling for each other. Besides stat boosts and almost automatic criticals, the characters in the first generation almost need to fall in love. Making sure who falls in love with who will seriously affect the second generation's stats, equipment and abilities, adding yet another layer of strategy to the tactic heavy game as it is. The game also enhances some of the frustrating parts of the earlier installments. Instead of limiting which characters can promote and having to spend extra time levelling up the character to get the most of them due to the 2 level tier system, you now have a one tier level system and you can level said character to the lowest level possible for promotion and still have a good chance of maxing them out. Weapons no longer break with no hope of ever using that particular sword again. Now it's possible to have your weapon repaired...for a fee of course. Plus you can't infinitely level up your character in the arena; now you have a limit of seven tough to face characters. However, arena abuse can still be managed through RNG abuse. Besides that, some elements of the game seem broken. For example, you can only let certain characters talk at certain points in certain chapters or miss it. Plus if you just happen to let an enemy get to your conquered castle, it's just destroyed with no hope of ever re-conquering it. Plus the game can be really short, especially for those who have already played games in the series. This is most noticeable at the beginning of the second generation, where all your characters have the potential to become powerhouses. You can blaze through chapters pretty quickly except when the AI corners you or you are one of those damn perfectionalists (like me) who insists on getting every character and item in the game. Despite it's shortcomings, it wraps up nicely into a great game that should last you at least 30 hours.  The graphics also got a nice overhaul compared to it's older brother, Monshou no Nazo. The overworld sprites (and the overworld) no longer look like the were easily done in a Paint program. They seem more like a painting rendered on the Genesis. The game's portraits have matured greatly. Whilst the last game had a children's Saturday morning cartoon feel, the portraits in Seisen no Keifu have a more seinen (teen anime) feel to them. The battle graphics, however, seem to be on even ground both in terms of artisticness and creativity. Whilst the overlapping features like forest edges are a nice little improvement, the graphics can't be compared because they both try to pull of different things. Whereas Monshou no Nazo had a realistic yet vibrant feel to the graphics, Seisen no Keifu seems to have a more cartoony look with realistic animations.  The sounds contribute greatly to the experience. Instead of hearing the same sound effect for each weapon, certain weapons are accompanied with different sounds. Whilst this is more prevalent in the spells than in the hand weapons, it's still nice to have that little feature. Whenever a character dies, a grunt (male) or a shriek (female) is followed after their death speech, something surprisingly absent in the American installments of the series. The music is also a vast improvement over the previous games in the series. Each score is much more involved and complex than the other installments. Whilst it predecessor merely had a hideously wretched melody repeating over and over, this game has a much more fitting theme that changes almost every chapter.  The story is very well written, but at some points it seems hard to follow. It also becomes hard to understand early on as it overindulges itself in politcal escapades that most people simply can't comprehend. The overload of events and mention of political terms you most likely will have to look up in a dictionary are a bit cumbersome. If you can manage to keep up with the events, there's a great story underneath the overload of events and mysterious words that plague the RPG genre.  If you're willing to put in the time to import the game and learn Japanese, by all means get it. \\t\\t\",\n",

       "   'description': 'Back in 1987, a small company named Square released Final Fantasy, an RPG that they had put all their sweat and blood into as the note they\\'d go out on. Who knew the series would become such a success? The series would go on to spawn many games, spinoffs, and even its own rock band. Almost every entry in the series (spinoffs included) is highly anticipated by the fans and becomes an instant classic, beloved by critics and gamers alike. However, the latest entry in the series, Final Fantasy XII, is one of the games in the series that falls short and is a disappointment, made more painful by the fact that it is an entry within the root series, rather than any of its spinoffs.  Despite some horrible flaws, the production values in this game are phenomenal. The graphics in this game use every trick in the book that one can think of. The characters look well animated and constructed, and the environments are incredibly lively and detailed. Textures look decent and the game makes excellent use of lighting and fog effects. However, Final Fantasy XII isn\\'t without its faults, and the graphics are no exception. While the character models look realistic, the characters\\' appearances sometimes look rough and rushed, sometimes as if they were pasted on (Vaan\\'s face and \"spray on abs\" come to mind). The game also has problems rendering NPC characters on a noticeable basis. While they usually render at the appropriate distance from the player, they will sometimes render late and randomly appear in front of you. Sometimes, an entire crowd of people will spontaneously generate in front of you.  Much like the graphics, the game\\'s music seems to be incredibly well done. Each rendition is fully orchestrated and sounds beautiful. The voices for each character are also done wonderfully. Although you may only recognize a few names from the roster of voice artists, the whole cast performs their roles greatly. The samples sport a plethora of emotion and convey the message quite eloquently. In fact, there are no real major problems with the game when it comes to the audio.  But where the game seems to fail the most is the gameplay. Its philosophy seems to be summed up best when an oft-mentioned quote from the game itself is paraphrased: to see the reins of the game away from the hands of man. Final Fantasy XII plays like most typical RPG\\'s. You move a single protagonist around a 3D environment, the properties of it dependent on the location. Towns contain NPC\\'s that can give helpful information or just seem to give you a quip that gives them more than a shallow personality, shops that sell weapons, armor, magicks, techniks, items, or gambits (part of the game\\'s battle system), and very often a key character/location that advances the game\\'s story. Towns also frequently contain a bar, where one can register for hunts, and a save crystal that restores your MP and HP (and, depending on the color, will let you teleport to other like crystals across the overworld). Dungeons and the overworld, behave quite similarly. While there may be a small stop to restock your supplies occasionally, they are not to be expected, with the same concept being applied to save crystals. What does populate the landscape are an incredible amount of monsters you battle. Unlike many RPG\\'s, the enemies can be seen and are battled on the same plane as the one you explore. You are also able to choose your battles as you please, narrowly and evasively dodging your foes.  A lot of this sounds good, right? However, the game starts to crumble with the battle system. As just about every gamer knows, no two Final Fantasy\\'s play alike when it comes to the battle system. Final Fantasy II had a cause and effect system that catered to your specific playing habits per character, and VI included altered stat progression and a spell system based on whatever esper your character happened to be holding at the time. The twelfth entry includes a \"gambit system\" that essentially lets you program your characters to do certain things based on the climate of the battle. For example, if one character\\'s HP falls below 50%, a character will cure them with an elixir (if they\\'re programmed to do so, of course). However, this system seems to steal the responsibilities of the player away from them so that the game may play itself. Thought-out gambits aren\\'t required, as one set of gambits may require little to no change throughout the entire game, allowing one to run from enemy to enemy and watch the battles, taking no part in the actual fights. The gambits aren\\'t necessary to play the game, but the game seems to pressure you into using them. Without them, battles become fairly tedious sessions of casting the right spells/using the right items at the right time. However, even with the gambits disabled, Final Fantasy XII will still attempt to take power away from the player by enacting its own hidden gambit that forces a character to keep attacking once you initiate battle.   Another major part of the battle system is Quickenings, a system that shares many similarities with the Limit Breaks of the Playstation installments. Once a certain character\\'s magic bar reaches its maximum capacity, it will glow orange, giving you the cue that you are able to use a Quickening. However, like the rest of the game, you\\'ll have little role in actually performing the attack. The amount of characters you have out at the time (limited to 3 at max) increases the amount of Quickenings at your disposal, reliant on which characters have them and if their MP is full or not. During the sequence when Quickenings occur, you can either initiate another or Mist Charge another character, allowing them to initiate their own Quickening. During all of this, you are at the mercy of the roulette, something that can be cycled through with R2. However, the chains of Quickenings soon become a mundane process of cycle through with R2 and Mist Charge/initiate another Quickening and watch the game handle the rest. Not only do they stick with the theme of wrestling the reins of the game away from the hands of the player, they can also make boss battles brainlessly easy. On that thought, boss battles in the game can range from incredibly, incredibly easy to frustratingly difficult. While some bosses can be destroyed with one or two Quickenings, while others seem to be almost immune to them. Add to this the tendency of many bosses to have (and use) attacks that take up their own cinemas and cannot be dodged, and the big fights of the game amount to an unbalanced atrocity.  Weapons, armor, and many aspects of the game are, in a way, acquired with the other namesake of Final Fantasy XII, the license board. When you purchase a new sword or spell or technik, you can\\'t use it right away. To use it, you must acquire the corresponding license on the corresponding character\\'s license board with license points gained through battle. More powerful equipment, abilities and status boosts are placed farther along the borders of the dual license and generally cost more license points. The whole system plays like a puzzle game, and while not as much of a nuisance as other aspects of the game, can place restraints on your characters that may make battles harder than they should be.  But why does this game seem to not want the player to play the game and instead opts for self play? For the most part, it appears that it wants to tell its own story to you to the point of removing the gameplay from the picture. This would be acceptable if the story was enjoyable, but it just simply isn\\'t. What the game has instead is a pretentious story that\\'s incredibly self absorbed. Final Fantasy XII at first follows the tale of Vaan, a street urchin who, along with his friend Penelo, work for a dinosaur creature for a living, having lost their parents to a war between two empires, their country caught in the crossfire and taken over by Archadia (one of the two empires). But through a short sequence of events, the story soon becomes your typical \"save the land from the clutches of the evil emperor\" story with a not often used Roman environment, ripe with corrupt judges and a Senate hell-bent on wresting power away from the emperor and into their own hands. All of this is told through a confusing political narrative that has an annoying tendency to use a language consisting of words that are either rarely used outside of an SAT composition or have literally fallen out of modern use. Such words include sunder, cacophony, and intercession. On top of this, not all of your characters get equal screen time, with the story fixated on Lady Ashe and her struggle to restore her fallen kingdom and conflict with power. Vaan and Penelo step aside almost completely, having their own conversations occasionally, but rarely affecting the storyline in any major way.   The villain of the story, Vayne Solidor, is perhaps the least evil villain to ever grace a Final Fantasy. Rather than come off as a dark warrior obsessed with achieving god-like status like Sephiroth, or an insane and twisted individual with a god complex like Kefka, Vayne attempts to politically justify his actions and is rarely seen interacting with any of the characters directly. Granted, the game builds up immensely in the end, with an easy to understand and emotionally driven narrative and a villain that truly comes off as evil, but the amount of time and work the game asks to get to this point seems outright criminal.  While the game does feature some amazing aesthetics, it couldn\\'t pull out any gameplay to match the quality. With gameplay that distances the player and a confusing, pretentious story, Final Fantasy XII caters only to loyal fans of the series.',\n",

       "   'description': 'Perhaps one of the best games for the Gamecube was Super Smash Bros. Melee. It reached to the far ends of the Nintendo universe to bring together some of the best fighters possible. Understandably, some of these characters are rather obscure and unknown to many people who own the game. Popo and Nana (referred to as the Ice Climbers) are two such characters. However, the source material of this deadly duo is far from the cult classic that Super Smash Bros. Melee would have you believe.  Like most games of the era, the story is paper thin and only serves to transition into the gameplay. The two explorers, Popo and Nana, have to get back an incredible amount of vegetables from a condor that placed them on 32 mountains. The obstacles that stand in their way are icy/brick platforms, arctic animals, and the deadly concept of gravity. Your goal is to climb to the top, retrieve 4 vegetables during the bonus stage, and get to the next mountain safely. Ironically, the evil condor can help you achieve this by grabbing onto his talons (not of his own accord, of course). In the co-op mode, doing so will give you a point bonus. However, a number of gameplay flaws keep this from becoming a decent game. Much like in Metroid and Kid Icarus, the advancement is vertical instead of the horizontal scrolling of most games at the time. But like other games, there is no turning back when the screen scrolls up with your avatar. This could be passed off as making the game legitimately difficult if not for the travesty that is the jumping controls. Popo and Nana jump up just fine, but move very little on the horizontal scale when airborne. The only way to make some of the tough jumps is to get a running start. However, some levels will place you on tiny platforms that don’t allow for much running room, if any at all. This becomes even more problematic when playing with a friend, as much like in Contra, the screen will scroll up, regardless if both players are high enough for them to avoid death. Such a faux pas only serves to add insult to injury in a game with a vertical focus.  The music is somewhat indicative of the time it was released. The soundtrack is meager, consisting of a pathetic four medleys played throughout the entire game. In 1985, this was acceptable so long as the soundtrack was memorable and superb, with games like Super Mario Bros. setting the standard. However, the songs in this game consist of minimalist pings and low-key notes that span only a few beats. In summation, this is not the melodious quality that you’d expect from a large company like Nintendo.  The graphics aren’t any better. Each character only has a few frames of animation, with the enemies having about two or three frames on average. But perhaps one of the most noticeable blunders comes within the bonus stage. The words “Bonus Stage” do not fade away as one might think, but rather are engraved into the background. The timer also suffers this affliction, as instead of scrolling up with the player, two simultaneous timers are etched into the background, painfully evident in the introduction to the game. On a lighter note, the game does have a cute charm that some early Nintendo games had. While the animations may seem limited and the mistakes noticeable, this game has a somewhat redeeming quality in its graphics.  So all in all, this is not the all-star hit that you would believe. Monotonous gameplay combined with grating music and flawed jumping controls in a game with a focus on vertical ascension kill what could’ve been a sleeper hit of a game.',\n",

Going hand-in-hand with this is their first video game console, the Neo-Geo (both a game system and an arcade cabinet format), which was saturated with fighters and shooters. Some notable examples include Fatal Fury, known for its dual-plane fighting system, King of Fighters, a product of the former, and Samurai Shodown, which set itself apart by combining the zooming camera system of the earlier Art of Fighting and its own weapon-based gameplay. Perhaps Samurai Shodown gained the best footing of the three, being both easy to play and incredibly fun.  The game is set in the late 18th century, mainly in Japan. The semi-fictional Amakusa has come back from the dead to destroy the Tokugawa for killing him, and makes a deal with the devil in the process. Although you eventually face him as the final combatant, your main goal isn\\'t always to destroy him. In fact, fighting him seems to be incidental. Unlike many other fighting games where one has to win some type of tournament and become the best fighter in all the land, each character in this game has their own unique motivation, often times not tied to becoming a better fighter at all. The ambiguous ninja Hanzo, for example, merely wants to find his long lost son, while Nakoruru, an Ainu girl from Japan, wishes to restore the tranquility of nature, which seems to have been disturbed by Amakusa. The only character that doesn\\'t seem to fit into all of this is Earthquake, the giant punk biker from Texas who seems like he\\'d fit in better in Hell\\'s Angels. And the translation doesn\\'t seem to help convey the story nicely. Amakusa will refer to his enemies as \"crazy funsters\" and his cohort, the devil, is just referred to by the painfully simplistic moniker of \"the dark guy\". Regardless, Samurai Shodown has a better story than your average fighting game.  However, story is rarely the entire focus of a game, especially a fighting game, where fast paced action and awesome special moves rule the landscape. Fortunately, Samurai Shodown has this base covered as well. Like just about every fighting game, you pick from a wide cast of characters (yourself included) and fight against the other characters in their respective homelands. You swipe at them with your weapons and kick them until their life bar empties. As is the unspoken rule for this genre, you can pull off special moves that vary from character to character by inputting a short sequence or tapping a button rapidly, often times more powerful or useful than your typical move-set. The techniques often set themselves up for some fairly good combos, which adds a bit of variety to the game and generally quickens the pace. Speaking of variety, many of the game\\'s features distinctly set itself apart from the competition.   Perhaps the most famous of the features is the extensive use of weapons, each character having their own specific weapon. However, this feature does create a bit of imbalance between the characters, as the ones with the longest reach will have a bit of an advantage. In fact, the final boss, Amakusa, is incredibly overpowered, able to teleport around the stage at will, launch attacks after said teleportation, and generally dodge your attacks at the last minute. This advantage can be taken away by a duel where each character tries to knock the other character\\'s weapon away from them, something that can heavily change the tide of battle. Actually, much of the game has features which can drastically alter the match quickly. A ninja in the back will randomly throw items onto the battlefield, which can range from gold that increases the frivolous point count, food that heals a fighter, and a bomb that will deal some heavy damage. Suddenly, the winner will be on their toes, or suddenly backed into a corner. The only major problem with the gameplay is the hit detection, which can completely ignore your hits from close up. This isn\\'t a common occurrence, though, so it\\'s nothing to worry about.  The game\\'s presentation is just as good as the gameplay, using the Neo Geo to its fullest capabilities of the time. The graphics are stellar, with detailed characters and backgrounds that are usually more active than your typical fighting game. The game prides itself on the small details, like how citizens will cheer you on, animals will scurry about from time to time and elaborate waterfalls will run in the background. But one feature in particular sets it apart from the droves of Street Fighter clones. The camera zooms out to allow more battle space (like Art of Fighting before it). The zoom transition is seamless, the sprites shrinking fairly well. Overall, the game\\'s graphics are among the best on the platform (at least for 1993). The music is just as good, ranging from traditional Japanese flute music to more modern rock. None of it feels out of place or awkward, each rendition fitting the theme the stages demands.  Overall, Samurai Shodown is a great game, and the Neo Geo version is ultimately the best. Each port has something wrong with it, like the Genesis\\'s bad sound and compromised presentation, and the SNES permanently zoomed out, but the Neo Geo feels exactly like the arcade game (which isn\\'t surprising, given that the Neo Geo has the same makeup as the SNK arcade cabinets). With detailed graphics and an easy to use fighting system, Samurai Shodown is easily among the best of SNK\\'s fighters.',\n",

       "   'description': 'I\\'ve been playing video games for almost as long as I can remember. As of this review, I\\'ve beaten 572 and played many more. Perhaps one of my favorite games so far is Super Smash Bros. Brawl. OK, it\\'s only in the top 3, but that\\'s still quite a statement. But why do I love this game so much? Brawl attempts something different when it comes to fighters. Rather than depleting your sole opponent\\'s life bar with arcane button and joystick sequences which fire fireballs from your hands , you bash your opponent senseless over large and intricate stages that can twist, turn and threaten you with instant death, until their percentage is high enough for you to knock them off the stage and into oblivion.   The characters in this game are incredibly well balanced, well varied and quite easy to use. Gone are the arcane button/joystick sequences I just referenced, as all characters perform their moves in the same manner. For example, the B-up moves of most characters act as a third jump to keep you from falling to your death. To compensate for the balanced character roster, the items are far more chaotic than in the previous iteration, Melee. Almost all can quickly turn the tide of battle, like the force of a falling Warp Star or the devastating power of each character\\'s Final Smash. Speaking of that, Final Smashes are perhaps the biggest change to the fighting system, as the focus of all players in a match will quickly change to the frantic beating of the orb until it allows you to unleash fiery death on your foes.  You\\'ve probably caught onto the fact that the game is best played with multiple people at this point. There\\'s an ungodly amount of modes to play, from team battles and custom matches to co-op affairs and player made stages. But worry not, lonesome readers among you, as Brawl allows you to play online. Yes, using the Wii Wi-Fi, you can play against people all across the globe (except Europe and Australia, where it has yet to arrive). Lag, however, can be a problem. Some matches can be silky smooth, others being so rough as to make the play think it\\'s been tossed down a gravel road only to later fall down a cliff. Overall, though, online is still pretty good and a good alternative for those who can\\'t organize a four player killfest.  Super Smash Bros. Brawl also offers quite the single player experience, too. You have events, Classic mode, Subspace, All Stars, and a plethora of other modes that can also be played with a buddy. The only one that especially stands out amongst the crowd is the Subspace Emissary, the game\\'s story/campaign mode. The basic story is that an Ancient Minister is blowing up areas into nothingness, and characters from all over the Nintendo universe (and even beyond) have some role to play in it. What I absolutely love about this campaign is that the tale is told without a single word uttered throughout the entire duration. That takes an incredible amount of talent, whether it\\'s the emotion portrayed when all the ROBs are ordered to suicide bomb the heroes or the humor of Princess Peach obliviously going out for a Sunday stroll while being fired upon by enemy ships (and then inviting others for tea). Subspace also wins me over with classic platforming levels influenced by some of the best of the genre, like Donkey Kong Country and Kirby\\'s Dreamland (not surprising, considering the same person designed the two games).   Classic and All Star seem to have suffered to a degree, though. The randomized order of each has been replaced with a pseudo-random one that can be predicted and planned out, which can remove a bit of the difficulty of a system that never turns out anything near the same result twice. Target practice is no longer custom per character, but rather by difficulty level and certain characters (essentially the villains) aren\\'t well suited to these trials.  You may think that\\'s quite a lot to say about how a game is played, but that\\'s just a testament to how large the game is. Perhaps the only thing within it to rival the high amount of ways to play games is the soundtrack. Brawl contains over 300 songs from Nintendo to Metal Gear to Sonic the Hedgehog, and you\\'re bound to find something you\\'ll fall in love with, like the \"ripped right from your Sega Genesis\" Sonic stage themes to the instrumental version of With Mila\\'s Divine Protection (from the Japan only Fire Emblem Gaiden). Truth be told, the game contains a few duds (essentially anything with lyrics), but the game has the courtesy of allowing you to prevent those failures from ever appearing if you don\\'t want them to. Ever.  Finally come the graphics, which definitely show signs of improvement over Melee (which itself looked fairly good). The characters show more detail than the somewhat flat models of its predecessor, and the game is generally appealing to look at. Quite a lot can be happening on screen at once, but it doesn\\'t slow down for anything (except during online matches, but that\\'s a completely separate issue I addressed earlier).  As you\\'ve probably guessed by now, I love Super Smash Bros. Brawl. It is easy to pick up and get into but hard to master, the music is a godsend to gamers who loved their older systems and the myriad of modes and unlockables still has me playing it long after its release. This is a game every Wii owner should have in their library, if they don\\'t already.',\n",

       "   'description': \"I had mgs4 in my grasp a lil late than most this time since i had some annoying complications with EMA and I had to start Old Snake's journey 6 days after release.Naturally watching all the video reviews and reading the now flooding amount of player reviews not having for myself was eating me up inside and frankly was almost considering intimidating GTA and robbing a game shop then admitting GTA made me do it...While i doubt any game will get me that wound up except maybe Resident Evil 5 it really was a chore to just sit and wait while everyone else was enjoying the greatest MGS to date.I obviously managed to get it and because of that i skipped almost week of college just to have some alone time with my lil precious :P.Feeling skeptical about the amount of 10's foating around almost as much as GTA4 i thought this might be another major dissapointment and luckily I actually agree with the majority of the critics about how fookin brilliant this game is. Actually calling it just a game would be quite an understatement considering how many messages and cinematics there are, the MGS series as i see it are very much unique and no company has tryed to copy its methods ide expect probably cause there too intimidated or just have too much respect for this outstanding series (very closing to tieing with the Resident Evil series in my taste's).Instead of starting my review early like some who only reviewed after around 3 hours to give it the verdict of the greatest game since games began, I played through the whole 18-22 hour long story to have a clear view of how i think what it really deserves.And i can see why through the first few hours people would see it as the biggest event since Jesus' 2nd coming since the first hours have some of the greatest gameplay yet.As Snake, or approprietly called Old Snake for this run thanks to his accelerated ageing, your called out of a hard lifes of Metal Gear destroying to have Cambell almost beg for you to take down the biggest threat the world has ever seen, Liquid Ocelot. I spose as far as the story goes thats the prob the best i should leave it because 1. just how large this story is and 2. just how many twists occur throughout. Though its no secret that 'alot' of old friends are returning there roles in the story will surprise you indeed and it makes it all the harder to say goodbye to some of them. Being sadly the last of this awesome series you can expect to find every loose end tied up and every story element explained to some incredible results. From why Vamp just won't die to the true founder's of the Patriots, everything that left you hanging in the past MGS' is found out in MGS4.Though with such a massive story and an even larger roster of characters to fill it with i expected it may fall a little and might feel a lil over-whelming like maybe they could of left somethings out, but luckily everything works perfectly and the story like the MGS predeccesors is the main motivation to keep going.The other main reason is of course the outstanding gameplay, what i especially love is unlike most of the 4th's these days MGS4 didn't completely revelate there gameplay schemes and merely improved extremely on the old ones. The main new additions is finally being able to move while crouching, the new over the should view teamed with the first person view (which you can move while in said view's) being able to roll left+right while aiming and a playing dead ability. Everything else is basically what you've already seen except much easier to pull off or just alot more fun to execute, which I'm extremely glad for since the MGS gameplay didn't really need much improvement in my opinion anyway. Though not being able to interrogate soldiers anymore is abit of shame but won't be surely missed.Though the styles now seem much more even, in the sense that shooting everything in sight doesn't secure death by insane amount of numbers this time around, infact the soldiers are now so much easier to battle with sometimes stealth isn't really needed. Stealth is still a fun option with loads of options and ways to sneak through, though the presence of an ongoing war in the first levels make both the stealth and the shooting much easier to get through as one faction of the war can actually become very useful allies for getting around. Though as the game goes through the stages, you might need to rely on stealth abit more since you will eventually end up on your own though also with much less soldiers to deal with.Another reason why MGS4 seems maybe leaning towards more the 3rd person shooter is because of how many scripted parts require you to blast your way through especially nearing the end, which makes the amazing variety of weaponry to come across a very welcome addition.Weapons in this game is much much much more varied than just one handgun, one assault rifle and just one type of book to distract the guards with.Theres around 45+ weapons to play around with and really give you the choice of what weapon set suits you best, be it a desert eagle along with an m60 and RPG or maybe a silenced pistol along with an automatic silenced sniper. Another great addition to the weapons is customisation, while some guns have more customisations than others around 80% can have some sort of attachment be it a suppresor or a torch or even a grenade launcher. So the amount of weaponry and how to use it spells quite abit of reply value just to play through again with a different set of weapons.Being MGS title of course sets you up with also a huge amount of cutscenes to sit through (and enjoy) and some interactive flashbacks to watch aswell. Yet again though after about the 20 hours it would take you to complete the game at least 9 hours of that is cutscenes, not like its problem for MGS fans since if you've lasted this long with the franchise the cutscenes have to be one of the reasons why you love these games, I can honestly admit even though maybe compared to more of a movie the story alone deserves the game a 9/10. Sometimes gameplay and cutscenes can also combine in a splitscreen mode to make a very intense and sometimes even tear inducing experience due to watching what everyone is going through while your doing your job.With so much to watch its a very warm welcome for the beauty of the graphics as it easily the greatest looking game i have played ( i haven't seen much of crysis but from what i've read there even better than that) with some top notch animation work and almost unbelievable enviroments. The characters of course look perfect and resemble some high budget CGI movie models, well the whole games looks like your very own interactive CGI movie in fact. MGS4 truelly is what the next gen of gaming should look like, its very much like the representive of just whats possible.The sound is just as perfect as the visuals with perfect voice acting (well from most) to an approproitly epic soundtrack. Throughout you'll also encounter alot of dialoque from the past just popping up mid-gameplay if it goes with the situation or maybe when exploring a certain Alaskan base or just for some quirky humor and can really bring some nostagia and also helps with tieing up the amount of loose ends.Like no game though in my opinion MGS4 isn't exactly perfect, there's not as many boss fights in this one and all are much easier than say the teeth grinding boss' in Snake Eater, don't get me wrong there still fun just a few more boss' to own would of made up for it. Also the game in general (on Solid Normal at least) is much easier this time around especially due to Old Snakes much improved moveset with the shooting.Also the Ipod which is just one of the random gadgets to expect from a MGS game doesn't live up to its entertainment value since you can't have any other item equipped while listening to some tracks from the predeccesors themselves, though can come in handy when your just hiding around and would prefer something listen to other than the alert theme.I haven't tryed the online play all that much though i do know first hand it is quite a pain for how long it can take to get started but at least your character customisation is decent enough to wait for. Since i haven't got a headset I still tink i'll leave online play alone though for now.That typed though this game is the very meaning of a must buy for the ps3 since it really does blow all the competition away and while i can see why people everywere are slapping 10s althougher it i can still think it could of maybe bin a little longer since as i said theres still not as much gameplay as you'de like.\",\n",

       "   'description': \"Like majority of the GTA fanbase i feel gta4 is a few years old in terms of variety.Waiting through the 10 minute installing process i never expected to get this impatient and was literally counting the seconds. Then after the pretty impressive intro to the next-gen look of gta and the cutscene i was left sitting in the car for a few minutes trying to figure out how the bloody hell i drive this contraption?!?After getting used to the new driving controls i was expecting this game to last quite a while, and it has although mainly for me starting to give up on beating those japanese high-scores on DMC4 :S...In control of Niko (who i have to agree is my favourite gta protaganist so far)i browsed my crap-hole of a flat, knocked over a few chairs was impressed with the simply push open door to get outside feature and took my first steps in the immersive world Liberty City.My first reactions like everyones I'm sure, even the one's that have given it an unfair 5, were breathtaking. Graphically I'm not really hard to please (still lovin the old school graphics of resident evil) and i thought the game looked great. For the most part, until your forced outa your first safehouse due to a very easily hateable antagonist i started to feel the repitition souring through me and even get a little bored with the mission goals.So thinking i might just try a few side missions to let me get over and eventually be begging for the story missions, it didn't work as well as i hoped. Yes i did go back to plowing through the story but because thats all there is!!!! No more car modding, no more taxi missions (well besides the occasional and pointless trip lifts for your cousin) no bicycle's not even any gangs to look out for. The improved vigilante missions however do really work well and are incredibly fun though theres only so many which leads me to another problem, theres no reward for doing 'anything' in this game, no more guns spawning at your limited amount of safehoues no unique vehicles to unlock nothing. Even the new and ridiclously hard hidden package system without collecting them all won't get you much anyway.There is however a friend system which i initially welcomed and was actually glad when they would phone me to go out, since at first that lead me to believe they weren't just AI's and would just want to hang out. Though the activities available are all pretty boring with to me the only un activitie would be the pool. Going to places to eat seem wasted since you simply walk in....2 seconds later you've apparently just had the meal of your life. With the gfs they even explain how much of a conversationist I am :S though of course theres no way to back it up since its all between them. Sorta made me feel like I was left in the dark missing out the most thought provoking conversations of my life...Even getting drunk isn't as satisfying as i hoped, listening to the conversations is funny enough and trying to get back home does have a small amount of entertainment to it, though again you don't see them actually downing the poison, just them walking in sober then sludging out pissed. I would of expected some sort of minigame to accompany it like a chugging contest or at least a small cutscene.Another main thorn that sticks deeply is that when driving drunk the police will go after you, which is obviously to stop all the bleeding 'concerned' parents to sue for not giving any consequences for drunk driving....but it doesn't make much sense when you can drive around sober like a total nutter and as long as you don't hit a cop car your in the clear....but you actually drive rather slowly and even on the right lane but if your pissed you'll still the boys in navy blue chasing you down. So you can ram through as many cars and bikes as you like as long as your not drunk while doing it....mmmmkay.Another huge flaw is the money.....there really is practically no use for it besides weapons and spending abit of small cash on your nights out.I must have given around 10,000 to hobo's cause i just have no use for it.There's no business' to run not even extra safehouses to buy...just a small amount of weapons to procure (no flamethrower!!!!!!) and limited amount of ammo to buy with it. There are clothes to buy (and that too is very limited) though about halfway i had already bought them all.Onto to the main focus (or only focus) of the game, the story, that is still very entertaining to play through though as i stated can become very reptitive. The morality choices you make (while having only little affect to the game) really give the game a nice add off rpgness (which is ironic considering how much of rpg play they took out of it) and actually made me think before pulling the trigger. Though as the story nears the end it gets very intense but doesn't pay off since the (both) endings pretty suck. Both aern't exactly a good ending and leave alot to pitch up and just leave you back at the same spot as you were in the beginning....some hired muscle but with noone to employ you.Though the DLC does sound to hopefully add alot more content i doubt 10 hours worth would match up whats missing and even with the DLC it'll probably still just raise my score to 9.0.The online play however does have potential to be very fun, though sadly everyone i know has a 360 so I'm left with a bunch of retarded cow mongeror's who thinks its funny to total your car in the co-op missions and quit when there losing in the competitive missions.Thats of course if I can get through since the ps3 version at least has alot of bugs and is really a game of chance if I can actually get through a game without a bleeding 'Lost connection to one or more players'So could of very much bin game of this year but honestly wouldn't even match up to game of last year.Summing up my favourite parts would be the cell-phone, just as handy as it is in real life (well to me anywhoo), the great new shooting system, graphics, much more varied radio selection (now whenever i listen to 'goodbye horses' it thankfully reminds me of running down hobo's in a mafia-sentinal instead of Ted levine's shemale pube exposing dance thingy) and the sheer realistic take on everything from the physics to the bloodstains that begin to show all over Niko and of course the vehicle damage and no blowing up when tossed over.The negative for me is definattely fueled by the repitition of the missions, sure car chases are pretty sweet the first 40 times your involved in them but can get rather boring. The shoot-outs are the same, insanely fun at first so much you want to actually go out there and buy a few dozen rpg rockets at your local gun shop and and just go around sending prostiteuts flying.Everything that was removed that made San Andreas the example of what a sand-box game had. No gangs, limited to everything and really just not that appealing after the storys finished. \",\n",

       "   'description': 'Where to begin, well, well Monkey Island 2 LeChuck\\'s revenge is a graphic adventure game by Ron Gilbert, and is the 2nd game in the Monkey Island Franchise and another game to use the SCUMM engine..Once again we take control of the Unfortunate Pirate Guybrush Threepwood, who entertained many the gamer back in the original Monkey Island, and im happy to say also made this true again with this installment and in my opinion did it better.However even though the game does very much revolve around its comical nature, (although i was sad to see no Insult sword fighting in this game) it is not its only saving grace, because as fans of The secret of Monkey Island will know, we also come to Monkey Island to challenge our brains.Now this game brought a new feature to the franchise, multi difficulty, The full puzzle game, then another mode called Monkey Island Lite. Monkey Island lite mostly follows the same story with a few minor differences naturally, as many puzzles are cut from this version,\\xa0 however both games come to the same conclusion.It was sad to see that much of the translation from full to lite was confused such as, references to places not accessible in Lite still being mentioned. To add to this someone who has completed the full game on \"Hard\" may be confused with the changes to a few main puzzles, missing characters and missing items.Now onto the actual game, the puzzles in this game, i found to be more interesting than its predecessesor, taking place in a few more environments and engaging with more whimsical and crazy characters, such as Governer Phatt, Largo leGrande, Captain Dread and Wally.\\xa0 In game like this elements such as the character is crucial as nobody wants to sit and go through puzzles with no real reward or incentive, and because of this the game has uniqueness, with the only other game capturing this quality being Broken Sword.Graphically the game in not much better than Monkey Island 1, (which is to be expected as they were only a year apart), that horrid character screen from the original was wiped and a more cartooney feel was added, this suited the game much better, a picture was added to each item which was pleasing to see, although added nothing to convenience.Now you may be saying, \"well what good have you to say about it\" well i can tell you, ALOT!The dialogue is ingeniousThe characters are entirely uniqueAll in all wraps up what a graphical adventure game should be like.Finally the score\\xa0I gave this game a 5/5 completely because this game is amazing to me, and as a fan of Graphical adventure games, is the best on offer closely followed by Broken sword 2, but never mind thats another storyFor fans of the Genre a must have 5/5Others can subtract 2 maybe 3 from this score',\n",

       "  {'deck': 'A pretty good remake with an interesting expansion.',\n",
       "   'description': 'Perhaps one of Capcom’s best known series, Mega Man has graced almost every system. In fact, most major consoles can be guaranteed two things: a few Madden titles, and a few Mega Man games. Even Sega’s platforms have had their own Mega Man games, such as Mega Man for the Game Gear, and The Wily Wars for the Sega Genesis. While the Game Gear title was merely a semi-remake of Mega Man IV for the NES, The Wily War was a compilation of the three best Mega Man games on the NES, and possibly in the entire series. The gameplay follows the formula that many Mega Man games before it have used: you select a level and progress through it, shooting down enemy robots and making tricky jumps, ultimately ending in you fighting the Robot Master of that level one on one and moving on to the next level after having bested him. While it may sound like another run-of-the-mill platformer when put as such, it does have many redeeming features that keep it from drifting into typicality.  For one, beating the Robot Master of a certain level yields you their weapon. Additionally, no one weapon is superior to the rest, as the Robot Masters have cyclical weaknesses, much like a larger scale of rock-paper-scissors. Outside of battle, certain weapons hold an auxiliary use, like Guts Man’s Super Arm being able to lift up rocks (which is how it is used as a weapon to begin with), or Flash Man’s Time Stopper being able to, well, stop time, allowing one to easily blast through the infamously hard laser shaft, where quickly blasting lasers will prevent your advance and kill you on contact. In the later two games, you also get items that can help you advance in ways that you couldn’t on your own, like the jet-like Item 2 of Mega Man 2, and the submarine-esque Rush Marine from its sequel. The game includes arguably the three best Mega Man games: the first three. It also includes Wily Tower, an end-game challenge that has you facing off against 3 Robot Masters inspired by Chinese folklore before, once again, taking down Dr. Wily. You are limited to 8 weapons and 3 items on your trek through Wily’s trial, making strategy and planning of the utmost importance. The level design is also pretty good, making use of many sprites and enemies from the other Mega Man games in a clever and challenging way.  The graphics are good, but don’t take advantage of the Genesis’ hardware to the extent that they could. The levels are vibrant and the animations remain true to the original games they depict. However, the graphics have a bit of inconsistency as to where they have new sprites and where they just update the old sprites. Mega Man has entirely new sprites, which is understandable due to him being the protagonist, but other major characters like Dr. Wily, Gamma, and most noticeable Protoman seem to be trivial updates to the original NES sprites. And adding insult to injury, Rush displays an odd graphical glitch that portrays him as Mega Man blue on the weapon select screen when in series the rest of the series (and on the field in this game) he is shown as crimson red. The game does have some noticeable slowdown, but this actually helps you due to the precision needed for certain bosses, like the Yellow Devil, Quick Man, or Shadow Man. All in all, the graphics are OK, but won’t wow you much compared to other games of the time. Perhaps one of the best improved and most well aged aspects of these old games is the music. Mega Man’s soundtrack was originally intended to be played on more modern instruments than the limited synthesizer that the NES had in 1989, and it shows. The Genesis’s 70’s suited synthesizers give the game a vibrant personality, especially in the psychedelic Gemini Man stage.  Overall, it’s a pretty good compilation that remains true to the original sources with little errors to find. If you find a cartridge of this game lying around on eBay, it would be a great addition to your gaming collection, both in rarity and game quality.',\n",

       "   'description': \"Many games in the era before 3D remained region exclusive. This is a real tragedy, as the entire world would have to wait until the advent of emulation and ROMs before they could experience true classics like the NES RPG Final Fantasy III, the SNES tactical-RPG Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War and perhaps the most famous example, the job-system-centric RPG Final Fantasy V. However, not every title to stay confined in a single gaming region is a gem. Some are just of average quality. One such game is Fire Emblem: Mystery of the Emblem.  The first game in the series, Fire Emblem: The Dragon of Darkness and the Sword of Light, was the first ever tactical RPG, and this game is both a remake and a sequel to it, so one would expect that the game does not offer as much depth as later games in the genre such as Final Fantasy Tactics and Disgaea. The game started the slight trend of games being both remakes and sequels with its Book 1 and Book 2. Book 1 is a somewhat watered down remake of the original game with updated graphics, music, and a retranslation of the game which reduces the somewhat OK script of the original to worn out archetypes and blunt, to the point dialogues. The whole book follows Prince Marth’s quest to rescue his sister Ellis (along with Princess Nina), obtain the Falchion, and stop the Doluan Empire from resurrecting the powerful Dark Dragon Medeus. Book 2, however, picks up from where the original left off and tells a new tale of how Marth must defeat his old ally Hadrian, the now Emperor and holder of an ancient relic by the name of the Dark Orb. But the translations currently available won’t help your understand any of this, as most translations have very little, if any of Book 2 converted into English. In order to fully enjoy the game, one must have a comprehensive knowledge of the Japanese language  Despite story differences between the two, they both share the same exact gameplay. As mentioned before, the game was based off the first of its kind, so an uncanny amount of depth is not to be expected. The object of all levels is to conquer the throne/castle (almost always occupied by a boss). You move units on a grid based map and can perform several actions from there. You can choose to attack your foe, recruit an enemy unit (an uncommon occasion that only works with certain units under certain conditions), trade items with units, or just plain end your character’s turn. Your characters level up after gaining 100 experience points and their statistics increase as one might expect. This may not sound like it is a very deep game, but it makes up for it in many other areas of the gameplay. For starters, death is permanent in this game. There are no spells to revive your characters, nor are there special items that do so, and even when they do exist, they have a one time use before breaking. As a result of this, the gameplay becomes much more strategic than most other games in the field. Within 30 minutes of starting up the game, you’ll soon learn when to charge head on, when to form a wall with your tank while slowly pushing onward and when to use the big guns like Volcannon and Starlight. The game also adds the Dismount command to the original’s arsenal, lending a bit more to the strategy. Sure, your character has better stats on a horse, but he won’t be able to use swords or enter buildings while he’s on his mount  A lot of this, however, does not mix well with the remake. The gameplay of the original has not aged well, and the original game was compressed by cutting down 6 chapters and getting rid of certain characters. The experience is not made better by the painfully simplistic maps and the fact that some of the new features, such as giving weapons and items their own sections for inventories and the previously cited dismount command, weren’t designed for the game to begin with. Book 2 is where the attributes of the game are used to their fullest. New maps and characters are introduced, the features seem to add strategic value, and the experience feels much more fleshed out. One flaw that both games share is that it is incredibly easy for those not familiar with the game to get lost and miss vital items to complete the games  The game’s graphics are where it seems to stumble a bit. Both games share the exact same looks, and the graphics themselves look as if they’re a compromise between the epic SNES RPG Final Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy III for the NES. The battle graphics do show some improvement over this, even if they do sacrifice consistency for good looks. Rather than appearing to be somewhat cartoony and exaggerated in appearance, the dueling characters look realistic move quite fluidly during battle. The turn based battles do make it look quite humorous that the opponents wait their turn to attack, but soon after starting the game, you’ll get used to and come to accept it.  While the graphics do somewhat disappoint, the music is a bit of a mixed blessing. As has been the case with most of the game, the original’s music is not an asset that has aged well. Most of the tracks in Book 1 are simplistic and repetitive. However, to cut the game some slack, it did come out on an 8-bit system to begin with. Book 2’s music shows a vast improvement over its predecessor. The tracks are much more complex, sound better, and help to further the story. And unlike Book 1, the map music will change several times before the end.  In conclusion, unless you've played the original game, steer clear of the poorly aged remake of it that is Book 1, as most of the game’s quality lies in Book 2.\",\n",

       "   'description': 'Mario, of Nintendo fame, has become the Renaissance man of video games. He has appeared in almost every genre from platformers to sports games and even RPG’s. His latest game, Super Paper Mario, blends the plumber’s platforming roots and RPG-style gameplay in such a way that no game before it can claim to have done.  The game starts with Mario and Luigi starting a journey to rescue Peach from Bowser. However, Bowser is not the culprit this time, and Mario ends up involved in a quest to stop the end of all existence, only stoppable by the seven Pure Hearts, found in seven separate worlds. In order to accomplish this, he must visit these worlds and travel through them in a manner reminiscent of older Mario platformers, especially games like Super Mario World. Taking a cue from his RPG skirmishes, enemies have their own HP count and often will not die on the first hit. When killed, they give off points, which go towards your overall score, another nod towards the plumber’s roots. However, their purpose has been changed to that of experience used to gain levels. To aid Mario on his quest are various Pixls, mysterious creatures with unique abilities. They serve almost the same purpose as your partners from previous Paper Mario games, such as Tippi, who can scan enemies and find their weak points, or Thoreau, who can grab objects and reach switches that Mario just cannot. Where the game truly excels will not be found in either of the components that combine to make this game. Mario’s special ability allows him to switch dimensions from 2D to 3D for a limited time. While in 3D, the plumber can find secrets only noticeable with that extra dimension, such as a different block arrangement or other characters and enemies. Over time, you gain other characters to control, such as Peach and Bowser. Neither of them can go 3D, but Peach can glide with her parasol and Bowser, along with being stronger, can breathe fire. What makes these aspects stand out is how well they work. Both have practical uses in both combat and puzzle solving (especially Mario’s dimensional flipping). For example, Mario may see a weak point on a boss or an entrance to a key area that otherwise would not have been seen. But the game does not completely abandon its RPG roots. You still get to use items that damage enemies, and they still require some sort of user input (shoot at targets on the screen; shake the controller to fill a meter, etc.). However, the game is far from perfect. For one, Tippi’s scan move is handled awkwardly, as it requires that the user switch from holding the Wii-mote horizontally to the one handed position and point at the enemy they wish to scan. Even after that, the game may not always register this move, and somewhat faster motions make for a rough movement that has the fluidity of a slideshow. The game is also notably short, being finished in the average rental period. These flaws do not detract from the fun that is Super Paper Mario, and is still a great game.  The story, as is the case with most of the game, holds onto its Mario heritage, but not entirely. It starts with an unexpected twist: Bowser and Peach at the altar, ready to be married! This unholy union is a scheme by the game’s villain, Count Bleck, to create the Chaos Heart and fulfill the nihilistic predictions of the Dark Prognosticus. However, there is hope. Mario, the hero of the Light Prognosticus (antithesis to the Dark Prognosticus), must collect the seven Pure Hearts and use them to thwart the plans of the evil and somewhat egotistical Count Bleck. The story is accompanied by a healthy dose of random humor, sometimes at the expense of those who play the game. While the humor is just as good as past Paper Mario games, the plot seems to deviate from the rest due to the seriousness of the tale. The most obvious example of this is the villain’s goal, which is not to gain some sort of ultimate power or thwart Mario, but to erase all of existence. Each chapter also features an interlude explaining the story of Timpani and Blumiere, two lovers driven away by fate, their relevance revealed near the end of the game. These elements make Super Paper Mario feel a bit more like a Square game, reminiscent of Super Mario RPG’s somewhat deeper plot compared to the games to fall in place.  Of course, Super Paper Mario would not be a Paper Mario game if it did not have the cartoonish storybook graphics of its predecessors. The game does indeed feature these graphics, and they are just as beautiful as before. The characters and environments are vibrant, full of color, and animate fluidly. It does look like The Thousand Year Door, but not much could be improved from that game in terms of graphical capability. However, the game sets itself apart from its forerunners with the looks of the 3D mode. The lush, 2D environments transform into beings that are more detailed. Environments become larger and expansive, bosses become larger and foreboding and linear pathways can adopt twists and turns that otherwise would not be seen.  Perhaps the best aspect of the game could be the music. Put simply, each melody exhumes personality and portrays the feeling it attempts to. For example, Dimentio’s leitmotif gets across his manipulative, insane, jester-like personality (much like Kefka of Final Fantasy VI fame) and the musical number that complements The Green Thunder comes off as awkward and bumbling, yet attempting to be evil, traits that all fit him. All of this is amazingly fit into the MIDI format, amazing because of the quality of it. Each song resonates an orchestral feel that almost sounds like the real thing.  Overall, this is a game not to be missed. The graphics are adorable and vibrant, the music is full of personality, and the story is quite intricate and humorous. But most of all, the gameplay is truly superb and like nothing seen before. Truly, this is a game not to be missed by anyone who enjoys Mario RPG’s, or even video games in general.',\n",

       "   'description': 'Earthbound, released in 1995 to the Super NES, is arguably one of the more inventive RPGs to date. Rather than a fantasy epic, involving Princesses and dragons, Earthbound is set in a more modernized world with skyscrapers, telephones, and ATM machines abroad.  Set in the year 199x in the world of Eagleland, your character, Ness, awakens one morning to the crash of a meteorite. Upon investigation, Ness discovers that the meteorite actually contains a bug sent from the bleak near-future. According to this bug, only with the help from three friends he\\'s never actually met and power gathered from key locations across the world, can Ness defeat Giygas and save Eagleland from impending disaster.  Though the graphics aren\\'t technically impressive, they certainly fit the mood of the game. The interaction between NPC characters will often leave you laughing, and Earthbound consistently provides goofy situations that would mostly be taboo in other RPG games. One of my favorites is the psychedelic town of Moonside, where you\\'re attacked by electric guitars and saying yes actually means no. With a healthy sense of humor, it\\'s hard not to fall in love with Earthbound\\'s quirks.  The game mechanics are very similar to Dragon Quest. In battle screen, you face your opponent in a first person view, where you you can simply choose to Attack, use Psychic powers (PP) to heal or attack, use goods in your inventory, or defend. With a click of the button, your means of attack is easily registered. However, if you\\'re attacked by an enemy, depending on your characters\\' vitality, you can prolong your death. For instance, if your character is \"mortally wounded\", your health will steadily trickle to zero. If you\\'re fast and able enough, you can either heal before your HP hits zero, or you can frantically try to defeat your opponent before your own HP is depleted. This adds a nice twist to otherwise tedious battle moments. Enemies are often of the wacky variety, such as the Unassuming Local guy, an evil circus tent, or the New Age Retro Hippy.  There\\'s no character customization in Earthbound, which may be classified as a detriment to the game. From the get-go, Ness has a limited range of psychic powers, but as you encounter enemies and level-up, your arsenal of abilities steadily increases. Ness mostly has healing and status-affecting abilities, and is loaded with HP. Your first ally, Paula, may be limited in health points, but she has a lot of psychic points (PP) to disperse attacks such as Fire or Freeze. Your third ally, Jeff, doesn\\'t have any psychic points. However, Jeff can repair broken items to be used in battle, and can also fire heavy-hitting bottle-rockets with ease. Your fourth ally, Poo, is merely average in all departments. He doesn\\'t have a lot of HP or PP, though he can \"mirror\" enemy\\'s abilities and does have one of the stronger psychic attacks in the game. Each character can hold a total of 14 items, which seems somewhat limiting, especially in the early on, when you only control Ness.  Earthbound never truely takes itself too seriously, which is definitely refreshing for the RPG genre. Despite this, due to some excellent pacing and a strange, if enduring storyline, it\\'s hard to put the controller down. The soundtrack complements the game superbly, with music that perfectly fits the wonders and humor of the setting. If you can admire all of Earthbound\\'s quirks, you will fall in love the characters and the world you travel in.',\n",

Everything from its cruel  and punishing difficulty to the maelstrom of fire hurling towards you, is only  offset by your own skill. I would not have it any other way.Original a  2001, Japan only, arcade release, Ikaruga's unique twist on top down, 2d  shooting is acclaimed as some of the best in it class. Ports also made it to the  Dreamcast in 2002 and then to the Gamecube in 2003. Now it is the Xbox Live  Arcade's turn to have its shot, so what is new?Not much really. However  this is not a bad thing. Ikaruga's main mechanic is the ability to reserve the  crafts polarity to absorb and fire bullets of the same type. There are two  types, black and white, with each type doing an increased amount of damage  against the other type. In other terms, black bullets damage white enemies  better that white bullets do, and vice versa. Simple in theory, however theory  is a traitorous thing and this allows the designs to input some truly devious  puzzles to pilot your way through. It also provide a surprising amount of  tactics to the game, giving the player the option to go all out offence, whilst  dodging all the incoming fire, or absorb and play it defensively. All this is  coated with a superb synthetic sound track, creating a truly satisfying  experience when you finally kick that boss in the shins.With the 360  version, the visuals have been cleaned, with a sharper, brighter presentation.  The games set pieces now look more stunning, creating that 'OH, damn!' from  start to finish (or whenever you die.) Online co-op is included for up to two  players, however beware: at time of writing, there have been numerous complaints  about lag over the Live service. Despite all of this, the real jewel of this  version is the replay function. This option allows players to upload replays of  there game to Live (similar to Halo 3's file sharing,) for others to watch and  gorp at the players skill, knowledge and manual dexterity.Anyone that  likes shooters should try this one out. Simple mechanics and gameplay combine  with a difficulty that punishes and much as it rewards, creates one hell of a  shooting experience that needs to be played to be believed. \",\n",

It\\'s Probably the best skateboarding game on the Nintendo DS, considering there\\'s only three skateboarding a games out there, and one in development (Technically there\\'s only two, because Tony Hawk\\'s Downhill Jam is more of a racing game than a straight up skateboarding game). I believe they did a good job with the graphics, considering they had to be Nintendo 64 quality (maybe a little less), that the levels are fairly big and they could fit them all on there. But hey, technology is amazing these days. The only thing is that the trees look rather \"junky,\" I know this is a Nintendo DS game, but I think they could have done a better job with the trees then what they had done.There really is no storyline other than you\\'re a new skateboarder, you just opened a skate park, and Tony Hawk magically appears to be in town. After you do what you have to do in you\\'re skate park, you then go to Philly, then it just keeps going on and you have to complete specific goals to pass the level. Basically the so-called \"storyline\" is the same since Tony Hawk\\'s Pro Skater 4. With the exception of Tony Hawk\\'s Downhill Jam.The gameplay is the same basic gameplay from all the past Tony Hawk games, except that you have the \"special\" tricks that you can pull if you tap their image on the touch screen. The environments are just as good as the past Tony Hawk games, but they are somewhat smaller then the new ones in games such as American Wasteland and Project 8. But hey it\\'s a handheld game for Pete\\'s sake!Some people may be wondering about the character customization and how good it is. It\\'s good, you can design your clothes and your skateboard deck. But what I\\'ve noticed is that the shirt customization has one problem, it has to be a long sleeve shirt. It can get pretty aggravating when you have a great idea for a short sleeve short, you make it, and suddenly you remember it has to be a long sleeve short. Then with modifying the shirt to be a long sleever it can be either better, or worse. But other then that one problem, it\\'s great.In summing this review up, TH: PG is a solid game that can be recommended to either the hardcore Tony Hawk fan or the casual gamer that wants to go on a Tony Hawk video game ride',\n",

Flashes of memory are sporadically shown through brief non-interactive FMV sequences when you complete certain objectives which keeps the story moving along at a good pace and provides all the twists and turns you’d expect from a UBI Z game.You’ll be starting off in a cage after being captured by the humanz which follows on nicely from the previous adventure, once here you’ll go through the controls tutorial and generally get acquainted with the new interface. Several events will appear at different times of day that are dealt with in a series of functional mini games, for instance shredded paper is dropped into your cage that you have to try to assemble into order before you soil it. Most mini games are controlled through the touch screen and are pretty intuitive, but don’t really stand out from all the other mini game collections we’ve seen. The one mini game that really does stands out is the water drinking game where you have to drink from a mounted water bottle by licking the DS microphone which is both innovative and creepy. Once you escape from the tutorial cage the house opens up to you and you can pick and choose your objectives, Hamsterz 2 really owes a lot to GTA in this area with the fetch quests and race missions which you’ll have to find using your ‘Hamster sense. Occasionally you’ll run into a boss battle, which can be incredibly tough and sneak up on you without warning. If you’re prepared and have found the Hamster ball power-up things get a whole lot easier as the hunter quickly becomes the hunted.Graphically Hamsterz is no slouch, FMV sequences are crisp and smooth and unlocking the different regions shows you new areas with their own graphical touch. The most major complaint is the bland open spaces in the middle of most areas which can leave you feeling like your lost in space, especially with the Hamsterz short eyesight which gives off a convenient distance haze.Sound may as well be non existent except for select rooms where you’ll find radios left on, once you learn the climb ability you’ll be able to get up and switch the stations, but I’d advise switching radios off entirely, or better yet just turning the DS sound off, you’d really not miss much here.Gameplay is where the game shines, the open-ended nature gives you a real feel of what it feels like to be a hamster in the wild. The hamster ball controls much like the morph ball in Metroid and it’s genuinely fun to chase those cats around the house. Other new mechanics such as the cheek system provides convenient storage but it takes some getting used to. The list goes on, including a mini game where you have to caption cats in various poses, half the fun is finding these crazy ideas, so I won’t spoil too much here.To summarize, people who want a family friendly GTA feeling on a smaller scale should definitely consider not checking this game out, as sadly Hamsterz will give you a more of a tiny Nintendogs feeling. But then a hamster in a morphball isn’t for everyone.',\n",

       "   'description': 'The first time I was introduced to the Devil May Cry series, it was DMC 3. I was instantly hooked. The fast paced action kept you on your toes. Dantes jokes would me laugh real hard, as well as Jester. And on top of that it had a great story. I\\'d just watch the cutscenes again and again (Special Edition).Then I got DMC 1. It wasn\\'t as fast paced as the third, and the jokes were minimal. At first I was kinda bored, but after an hour or so I loved it.Then, despite the bad reviews, I got DMC 2. It didn\\'t hold a candle to the other two, but on it\\'s own, it\\'s a decent game.And then came DMC 4. I was afraid that I would be dissapointed. I wasn\\'t. I won\\'t spoil the story, but let me just say that it\\'s just as good as the third (gonna compare to the third, as it reminds the most of the third), but it didn\\'t have the same impact. The music is great. It doesn\\'t get anoying hearing it again and again. But personally I still prefer \"Devils never cry\" (main theme in DMC 3), but that\\'s just me.Obviously the newcomer nero\\'s got some different moves than Dante. And don\\'t worry, he\\'s every bit as good as Dante, while playing completly differently.\\xa0The Red queen (his sword) has\\xa0got a load of moves, as do the devil bringer (his arm). And Blue rose (his revolver) can charge up to do massive damage. But don\\'t think Dante\\'s left out in the cold. He can now switch styles on the fly, and carry three guns and three devil arms. He now upgrades his styles buy buying a new level.Some other stuff you should know. Unlike previous DMC games, you can now sell a move if you don\\'t like it. You still use red orbs for blue orbs, purple orbs and items. But moves are bought sepeately using \"proud souls\". Also\\xa0Dante and Nero share Health, red orbs and proud souls.To sum it all up. I don\\'t like the story and music and story as much as in the third, but thats a matter of oppinion. Dante isn\\'t as fun, but can still put a smile on your face. Now does this mean you should just get the third? No. This is a great, fun, AWESOME game. You should get\\xa0DMC 3 and 1 first if you care about story. Though it won\\'t be impossible to understand it.I apologize if you haven\\'t played DMC before, and didn\\'t understand all the things I said. I\\'ll make a DMC 3 review soon.',\n",

       "   'description': \"You really cannot get much more niche than Wartech since it\\xa0is a fighting game with the mechanics of a shoot-em-up. \\xa0 While it sounds confusing it boils down to shooting the other ship until it explodes. \\xa0Naturally, there is a bit more too it than that. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Am example of a player going into B.O.S.S. mode To take down your opponent, you have an assortment of weapons at your disposal. \\xa0 You can, of course just mash buttons and  bullets will come out. \\xa0 Like any fighting game, certain combinations of buttons allow you to perform special techniques and rewards strategic thinking to defeat the opposing player. \\xa0 With eight characters and two variations of attack with each character there’s a ship for most every style of play. \\xa0One gameplay element that Wartech brings is the ability to essentially turn into a shoot-em-up boss during the match a limited number of times by activating what it call B.O.S.S. mode. \\xa0 You sacrifice mobility and energy to attain more firepower and overall general coolness. \\xa0This sounds like an overpowered mechanic, and for the first time play it very well is, but the bullet patterns are set and you can only change their angle as in boss mode. This in turn makes it so that an experienced player can stand up against a boss on near equal footing.\\xa0This is just basics and the mechanics are much deeper and beyond the scope of a review.\\xa0 \\xa0This is in fact a dude While the gameplay might please fans from both genres, it also brings the weaknesses from both fighting games and shoot-em-ups. \\xa0 The story is convoluted and not good; though if it does hook you for some reason there is a section in the game that explains the story for you. \\xa0 While not a big knock on itself considering the target audience for this game, this game is very much mired in stylistic anime aesthetics to the point where the males leads look like girls. \\xa0 If you thought Bridget from Guilty Gear fame was a trap, you haven’t seen anything yet. \\xa0 Fans of both genres shouldn’t mind the flaws though. \\xa0 In fact it’s almost become a characteristic of the two styles of games. \\xa0\\xa0The modes of play are straight out of a fighting game: Arcade, Story, Practice, and Online. \\xa0Good luck trying to find other online fighters however. \\xa0The graphics do what you expect them to do, neither horrendous nor stellar and your usual anime mech fare. The electronic/techno soundtrack to\\xa0Wartech\\xa0ranges from forgettable to being quite catchy. \\xa0Also,\\xa0as of this writing, you can get Wartech brand-new for about ten US Dollars so the price of entry isn't bad.\\xa0Wartech:Senko No Ronde is admittedly not for everyone, after all it caters to two very niche audiences here. \\xa0However there are very few games like it out there and for ten bucks, you could much worse.\",\n",
