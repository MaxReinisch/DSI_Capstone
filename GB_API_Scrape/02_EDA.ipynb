       "  'description': 'Rambling on about one of my favorite games. Nerd alert.It\\'s funny you know, I have this amazing gaming PC at home (my work machine on the other hand is a Mac) and despite it being able to put my xbox 360 to shame I find myself regularly loading up a 2D based RPG released almost 4 years ago by a legendary, though now defunct studio. What has me playing Icewind Dale 2 instead of Oblivion (which is a great game that I still haven\\'t finished)? Party-based gameplay, best of genre strategic combat and the most varied character creation of any game ever released. Years later I still can sit for hours thinking up clever names and picking portrais for my sad band of pixelated hereos.I remember seeing Greg give it an 8.3 all those years ago and completely agreeing with the score. It was a great game, but there was virtually no story and even then its Infinity Engine graphics were below par for the time. Neverwinter Nights was released around the same time and IWD2 was seen by the press as this last gasp funeral for people that just couldn\\'t let go of games like Baldur\\'s Gate. NWN and Bioware were supposedly taking us to the future of RPG gaming that would bring the genre to the mainstream. Little did we know that it would be another old-time stuido, Bethesda, that would usher us into that new era with Morrowind and Bioware would start making neutered Star Wars games.Since 2002 I have played Morrowind twice, NWN and it\\'s expansions once and Icewind Dale II six times. I have played virtually every single-player PC RPG released in the past 4 years and found that nothing comes close to IWD2\\'s depth or fun factor. Somehow this old \"8.3\" game has provided enough replayability for me to load it up year after year and take a party of 4 to 6 characters (with silly names like \"Kelgar\", \"Dash\" and \"Vicor\") across a bloodied tundra of 40 hours of non-stop fighting.At this point I\\'ve figured out why I love IWD2 so much and why I\\'ve continue to come back to it. The game is both very hard and very fair at the same time. Unlike most hard games you don\\'t feel like the game is cheating you or unfairly assisting its monsters in some way. When you lose in IWD2, you lose because you made a mistake or you weren\\'t thinking about how to attack a situation. This is true regardless of your party\\'s composition, and because of that it is always fun to play. Of the six times I\\'ve played it through, I\\'ve had a completely different party that needed to utilize different strategies to get through the same difficult scenarios. I\\'ve died dozens of times on the famous \"bridge fight\", a battle that finds you flanked on both sides, running out of spells midway through the fight and relying on some clever positioning to keep all your characters alive.The best way that I can describe the variety of combat to someone who is used to RPGs, but may not have played IWD2 per se is that in IWD2 your most powerful spells have nothing to do with damage. Although there are a lot of RPGs out there that give you lots of spells most of them end up being worthless; you end up just spamming the high damage spell trying to kill a single character. Not so in IWD2, your most powerful spells are things like sleep, color spray, grease and ray of enfeablement. While you\\'ll use that fireball at some point, it\\'s only after you\\'ve neutralized your enemy that you\\'ll even bother to attack them.Why is this strategy (which is super fun and stressful) so common in IWD2 but not other games of its type? Simply because in this game its not uncommon to fight over a dozen enemies at a time. If you tried to just attack them you\\'d be overwhelmed. Unlike Oblivion you can\\'t just run around the arena with your shield up casting fireballs at those 2-3 powerful guys, there\\'s no where to run in this game, the enemies are coming at you in large numbers and there\\'s nothing you can do about it but lay down some debuff spells, hold that holds half of them off and then concentrate your damage at what is now a pretty fair fight.The tension and skill you find that comes out of these types of battles is intense, and because your party is always so different with each new game, your way of combatting the situation will always change.It\\'s a hell of a ride and one I will likely return to again next year. If you aren\\'t afraid of a challenge and don\\'t mind looking at a bunch of sprites I highly recommend you check it out. That 8.3 might have been true for its time, but like a good wine, Icewind Dale 2 has aged quite well.',\n",

       "  'description': 'There’s something to be said for single-minded purpose in game design. Gauntlet Legends is a perfect example to be used in the argument, no matter on which side you might be. It’s an unapologetic dungeon crawler. You hack. You slash. You level up. It doesn’t aspire to do anything more. It may not do a whole lot but don’t take that to mean it’s not worth playing. It does what little it does do very well and if you’re looking for a hack-and-slash RPG in the classic sense, this would be a fine choice - especially if you have some friends wanting to join.Gauntlet Legends is revolves around the story of a big bad demon named Skorne, who was summoned by an eager young mage long ago but then turned on his new master and spread 13 runes across…ah, who cares? The story in Gauntlet Legends serves no purpose other than to provide you with a bad guy to fight at the end and a bunch of little bad guys to fight along the way. You fight those bad guys in four different worlds with about 5-7 stages in each world. Each of the worlds is certainly distinct from one another but the stages within those worlds tend to bleed together.You fight as one of the four characters from the original Gauntlet: the warrior, archer, valkyrie, and wizard. There really isn’t much of a difference between them, though. Each plays about the same way with main variance between them being how the characters’ attacks look. They also have slight stat difference but too slight to make a difference. The highlight of each character is their power attacks - devastating attacks that recharge as you play. These impressive attacks annihilate everything on screen (and off-screen if you’re lucky) with matching visual flair. A number of items spice up combat instead of a variety of moves. There are amulets to strengthen basic attacks, multi-shot items to proliferate your ranged attacks, and hourglasses to stop time. The items are a blast to use and who doesn’t like growing huge like Apache Chief and obliterating some dudes?Legends looks alright but it’s nothing special. The aforementioned power attacks look fittingly impressive but can cause some slow-down when used if the screen is filled with enemies. The catch is that the attacks are most often used when the screen is full of enemies. Oh well, can’t have everything I guess. Some environment textures can be pretty blurry as well but the player characters are better detailed.And with Gauntlet Legends, the more of those characters being used, the better. This game thrives on co-op play. The arcade roots of the game have obviously remained intact on the transfer to consoles. It’s at its best when you’re stomping through a few levels full of demons with three of your buddies.What’s on display with Gauntlet Legends might seem too simplified for some, but that really is the game’s strength. It’s single-minded, it knows it, and it does well the one thing it sets out to do. It doesn’t bring anything new to the dungeon crawler but that’s not a bad thing in this instance. It’s a great example of the genre and easily recommendable to anyone looking to knock around zombies, lizards, and skeletons with some friends.',\n",

       "  'description': 'The last and best of the MVP Baseball Series, MVP 2005 represents a spit-shine of the franchise. Due to the Take-Two third-party exclusivity agreement with the MLB, EA’s brand of baseball ends with this installment. It’s a shame really. Growing out of the Triple Play series, MVP has come to represent some of the best in simulation baseball. The main new features for this installment are Owner’s Mode, mini-games, and Hitter’s Eye. Hitter’s Eye is a system to tell what kind of pitch is being thrown before the ball actually leaves the pitcher’s hand. This is done through the ball flashing different colors corresponding to a specific pitch, as in white for fastball, red for curveball, etc. Hitter’s Eye really doesn’t have much of an effect on the gameplay, however. It can occasionally offer a good tip while on offense but I often found myself paying little to no attention to it. Owner’s Mode is an addition that fans of the series have been clamoring for since 2003. Its absence from MVP 2004 was certainly conspicuous due to the inclusion of similar modes in other EA Sports titles, like Madden 2004. Owner’s Mode gives complete control of an organization to the player by allowing them to build their own stadium, hire/fire staff, set ticket and concession prices, run promotional giveaways, and other decisions that the suits behind baseball teams make. All of this is stacked on top of the existing Dynasty Mode framework, resulting in an exceptionally deep season mode. It’s also fun on top of being deep. Building your team and making money (even if it’s fake) becomes very satisfying and addicting. The mode can become entrenched in micro managing, however, resulting in too much time navigating menus and not enough time on the field. Also, beginning with a major league team in a minor league ballpark is just kind of weird.The mini-games may seem, at first glance, to be a throwaway addition. In fact, they contain some of the most fun to be had in MVP 2005. The batting mini-game consists of a field with various ramps and obstructions placed on it. You receive points based on the distance of your hits. On top of that, each pitch is delegated a certain part of the field to be hit to and, sometimes, a fly ball or ground ball trajectory. The pitching mini-game is basically a baseball version of Bejeweled. The strike zone is divided into a series of rectangles, each with a color. That color corresponds to a certain pitch and the player receives points for throwing the correct pitch in the right location, with larger groups of rectangles rewarding more points. The mini-game has timed and untimed varieties, of which the timed version is superior due to its gleefully frantic nature. Both of the mini-games offer a surprising amount of fun and can also affect gameplay by being used as stat-boosting activities during Spring Training of Dynasty/Owner mode.Gameplay-wise, MVP 2005 doesn’t stray far at all from the 2004 iteration. This is a very good thing. The unparalleled amount of control given to the player previously still remains unparalleled.\\xa0 Small tweaks have been made to pitching (a more forgiving pitch meter), baserunning (more difficult stolen bases), and hitting (the ability to move around in the box and the inclusion of foul tips), but the core game has remained intact. Pitching still consists of the golf swing meter used to determine pitch speed and accuracy. A small tweak has been made this year, however, by making the sweet spot of the meter slightly wider in order to be more forgiving. Hitting remains based on timing and the direction the analog stick is pushed. Fielding and baserunning keep the diamond-based button layout with throwing using a simplified swing meter. Everything adds up to result in some of the best gameplay conventions in the business. Graphically, MVP 2005 looks excellent. The many player models look authentic. Star players each have individually modeled life-like faces with a number of generic, but still well done, faces filling in for everyone else. Player bodies, thankfully, look in line with reality with no players looking so pumped full of ‘roids they could explode. Stadiums, as well, look authentic with notable landmarks like the fountains of Kaufmann Stadium looking lovely. But animations are the star of the show when it comes to MVP 2005’s graphics. Everything benefits from the inclusion of thousands of new animations, particularly hitting and fielding. Hitters react realistically in the batter’s box following swings and foul tips. Instead of returning right back to their stances like some kind of batting robot, hitters will get mad at themselves after bad swings and mosey about after foul tips. Strikeouts are another showpiece for the animation, with appropriately dejected or angered reactions. Fielders have a wide range of ways to make plays on the diamond because of the variety of animations. Diving stops and leaping grabs? Yep. I’ll-get-to-it-when-I-feel-like-it plays? Yes’m. Sunday hops to infielders? Uh-huh. Each of these plays is then followed by an assortment of throwing animations. Game after game, you can still see new plays happening in the field. In short, the players move like baseball players are supposed to move.In the audio department, all the sounds of baseball are present. EA Sports has done a wonderful job of capturing the atmosphere of the ballpark with everything from the hecklers to the hot dog vendors. On the field, the crack of the bat and the smack of the ball in the glove sound very genuine. The main knock against the audio presentation is the commentary. The duo of Duane Kuiper and Mike Krukow do a passable job of play-by-play commentary but it’s nothing to write home about. Kupier reacts similarly to most plays, be it a single through the hole or an inside-the-parker. He remains relatively flat and unenthusiastic throughout. Krukow provides much needed contrast to Kuiper by offering some animated color commentary. Often he’ll get so excited that his voice even seems to break. Another gripe against the commentary, aside from Kuiper, is the repetition of phrases like “this guy” or “that player” instead of using player names. It begins to stick out like sore thumb after awhile.MVP 2005 supports online play, as well, save for the GameCube version. There isn’t really much to say about it other than it’s online baseball. If that’s what you’re looking for, that’s what you’ll get; though, it does boast some nice features like custom rosters and tourneys. The quality of the online play really depends on the quality of your and your opponent’s connections. Bad connections can lead to borderline unplayable games and certainly not enjoyable ones.MVP Baseball 2005 is one of the best baseball simulations around, even still to this day. Games since its time have looked prettier and flashier; none have played better.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Need for Speed: Most Wanted acts as an injection of freshness that the series needed after the Underground games. Those games, and other franchises, have stretched the tuner scene pretty thin. They also lacked any real police presence, a key feature of earlier series entries and an omission that didn’t do the games any favors. This latest iteration rectifies that mistake and puts a good foot forward for the new generation of consoles.In Most Wanted, you play as a no-name racer in Rockport taking on the Blacklist, a collection of the 15 most notorious street racers in the city. The game starts off with you taking on Razor Callahan, who occupies the 15th spot. But it’s never a fair fight. Razor’s cronies mess with your car before the race causing you to not only lose the race, but lose your car and get arrested to boot. You’re back in the saddle soon enough, though, with help from a woman named Mia. \\xa0The incredible FMV cutscenes scattered throughout the game are also introduced at the beginning. These cutscenes aren’t incredible for their visual panache (though they do sport a cool look by combining live actors with CG backgrounds) but instead because of their performances. The acting on display here would put William Shatner to shame. The characters are so absolutely chomping down on the scenery that you can’t help but laugh. Whether it’s intentional or not, it’s still hilarious. However, most of the story is conveyed through text and voice messages from the various characters for the remainder of the game. These contain a good amount of hamming themselves; nevertheless, the cutscenes take the cake.The game’s career mode sprawls out from there. You’re tasked with taking down Razor, and since he’s now #1 on the Blacklist, everyone else along the way. You accomplish this by beating each member of the Blacklist in races, but you first must prove yourself worthy to face them by completing a number of other challenges. These include driving game staples like circuit, sprint, drag, and knockout races. Checkpoint races are present in the form of tollbooth races and speed trap races place a number of radar guns around the track that clock your speed with the racer with the highest total combined speed at the end of the race winning.Besides the races, you have to reach milestones involving the game’s biggest adversary – the cops. These range from getting a set number of cops involved in a chase to accruing an overall bounty through various illegal acts. Police can get involved both during and outside of races. However, chases outside of races are where the real fun is. They begin small, with only a few squad cars, but as your heat level rises, the big guns get rolled out. Spike strips, roadblocks, helicopters, and federal Corvettes start bearing down on you. At this point, eluding them can get pretty complicated, requiring you to get and stay out of sight. Oftentimes, just when you think you’re safe, a patrol car will come screeching around the corner to blow your cover. It’s maddening and nerve-racking and thrilling all in one.The core racing through which all this takes place, for the most part, is fun. The computer tends to keep races close by exhibiting some rubber band tendencies. However, this isn’t as detrimental to the game as it might initially seem. In fact, it accentuates the experience, especially when the police are involved. There’s more bumper-to-bumper racing in those situations than you’ll see in any driving game. But it can be annoying near the end of races when the computer immediately pounces on little mistakes, making you start the whole thing over again, but the trade-off is worth the gripes.The graphics of Most Wanted go a long way to enhance the experience through detailed car models and a good sense of speed. The varied environments in the city of Rockport and flashing police lights reflect off car models in convincing fashion. But sometimes all the visual flash can be too much and causes the game to stutter. It’s not a huge problem but it certainly detracts from the visuals. The audio portion of the game is largely excellent. The aforementioned voice performances are great, at least depending on your viewpoint. Engine roars and tire squeals are high quality too. But the police chatter is, by far, the highlight. It makes you wonder if they just stuck a microphone up to a police scanner; it sounds that genuine. Meanwhile, the music that accompanies the gameplay is rather generic. A lot of hip-hop and rock with some techno mixed in for good measure plays in the background, but a decent chase-y theme kicks in when the fuzz get involved.Need for Speed: Most Wanted doesn’t do everything perfectly. But it does most things very well. Especially the police sections, and that’s a good thing given that putting “Most Wanted” in the title without nailing the police chases would be inexcusable. All in all, this game offers more thrills than most racing titles and is certainly worth checking out.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Grand Theft Auto in my eyes is one of the best game series of all time and is destined to be a classic remembered twenty years down the road and beyond. It was to my great joy that Grand Theft Auto IV was hinted at some three years ago and what a journey has it been. Thankfully on Tuesday, April 29th 2008 the game I waited oh so long for finally came out after a couple of mind numbingly annoying delays. I had huge expectations from this game as it garnered the first 10 from Gamespot and IGN in a decade and had critical acclaim from media outlets that had previously bashed it. Let me just say that my expectations of an amazing game were not just met but were shattered. This truly is the best Grand Theft Auto game of all time and it truly earns the first perfect review I have given.  Let\\'s start off with one of the highlights of GTA IV, the wonderful graphics. I have never been so amazed by a games graphics in all my life. This game literally was the first game to make me say, \"Wow\" when I first feasted my eyes upon it. The game has some very technologically proficient graphics courtesy of the RAGE engine upon which it is based. For the first time in GTA history the characters function as life like humans, each finger has its own motions, the characters express a variety of facial expressions, and the world is living and breathing. The water has also become beautiful in its own right and of course Liberty City is one of the most beautiful landscapes ever rendered into a game. The sheer amount of detail that was put into cars and civilians simply is amazing. The cars look in my opinion near life like and look as good as the cars in any racing game, and that\\'s not even the main focus of the game. The car damage has been vastly improved as well to make it more realistic. The civilians and other people in the environment look just as great as Niko and I have yet to see the exact same person twice. The city is a living and breathing metropolis. Perhaps the most amazing graphical achievement I have seen in this game is the explosions and gunplay. Every bullet hole is seen on a wall and gunfights just look great. Shooting up cars now displays to you cracked window shields with blood in the cracks and it just looks good. The explosions are the highlight of the graphics in my opinion, each one is amazing and the smoke bellows and the fire send an inferno within a large radius. These truly are mind shattering explosions. The physics engine is really put to use, for instance blowing up a police car with five officers around it will send all the police flying in different directions flailing and screaming for their lives. It\\'s just satisfying and brings a new sense of realism and is an amazing achievement in the game.  As far as game play goes Grand Theft Auto IV has fixed and changed many things about the game, despite these changes though the game still has the unique feel of a Grand Theft Auto game and not something totally different. Perhaps the most important game play change to mention is the new and redone combat system. Apart from improved aiming Rockstar has also added in a cover system. All of this works very well and it\\'s a blast to get into gunfights knowing the combat will be seamless and easy to get the hang of. I have never had a problem with combat though I understand some people have. I don\\'t blame them for having these problems but I think what they complain about is trivial. The combat system still has slight room for improvement but it is much better this time around and I really had a lot of fun. The melee combat is also a lot different now as it is far more complex and deep but still a lot of fun. It has made the melee combat a lot more fun and a lot more brutal. Another excellent game play element is the cell phone which is probably the best new feature in the game. I absolutely love this thing; you can arrange dates with your friends, take pictures, play multiplayer, and take calls from mission givers. It\\'s just a great feature and feels seamlessly integrated into the game. It doesn\\'t feel tacked on but rather it feels as if it\\'s always been apart of GTA. In a sense it has as cell-phones were used in the past in Vice City and San Andreas but never to this level of depth. The other new features in the game play are all great but somewhat negligible to mention as they don\\'t add a lot to change the experience but certainly if you access them they make the game a blast. Some of these include being able to go to comedy clubs and cabaret clubs which are amazingly funny and entertaining.  The sound of Grand theft Auto IV is top notch. The soundtrack in my opinion is amazing and Rockstar really did a good job of using licensed music in the cut scenes and to set mood. The radio stations are all great and I was happy to see Rockstar taking risks with the types of music they chose to put in. This soundtrack is my favorite yet as it didn\\'t distract me like it did in previous Grand Theft Auto games but rather made me feel more into the game. It was also great to hear plenty of new music I never heard before. Unlike San Andreas or Vice City where I heard it all before Grand Theft Auto IV allowed me to hear plenty of new stuff that I surely enjoyed. The script is also top notch; the dialogue is snappy, smart, and funny. Niko is the most real character yet thanks to his dialogue and the other characters are brought to life through excellent writing and excellent voice work. One notable change in the voice work was no celebrities were brought in this time around unlike in other Grand Theft Auto games. This is a welcome change and I didn\\'t miss them one bit, the voice actors in the game were amazing and I thought they did a better job then any of the Hollywood actors did in the past. The sound in the game is of the highest quality and should be a bar that all games should shoot for.  Grand Theft Auto IV is in my opinion simply the best game ever made. Previous to it my favorite game of all time was Grand Theft Auto San Andreas but this game easily tops it. It highly deserves a ten score and all the critical acclaim it has garnered from various publications. Its value is excellent, the single player clocks in at around 50-60 hours with all the side missions you can do and the multiplayer lasts forever with 15 modes to play around with. This is a game I will have fun with for a long time and I am glad I bought it opening day. Paying 60 dollars for this game is a steal of a price as it is worth a ton more. Buying this game isn\\'t a choice but rather an obligation at this point as this is quite possible the best game I have ever played, hears waiting for Rockstar\\'s next entry into the Grand Theft Auto series. In the meantime I\\'ll be playing Grand Theft Auto IV until my eyes fall out, simply outstanding from start to end.',\n",

       " {'deck': 'MGS4 blurs the line between cinematography and gameplay. ',\n",
       "  'description': \"Metal Gear Solid has always been praised (and sometimes bashed) by it's long cutscenes, movie-style cinematography and mind bending plot twists. Metal Gear Solid 4 continues this trend by not only reaching this goal, but by blasting it into hyper-space. But what hasn't been done well in a Metal Gear Solid game is a perfect control system, an in-depth and varied gameplay and intense action, to which Metal Gear Solid 4 not only improves upon these elements, but perfects them.Snake's final chapter begins in the Middle East, and he is tasked with the extermination of Liquid. With nanomachines controlling and surpressing soldiers emotions, and Snake's curiously rapid aging, you know things are going to go horribly wrong from the beginning, which leads to Snake jetting off to South America, Europe and some other exotic and not-so-exotic locales. All loose ends get tied up in MGS4, such as the FoxDie virus, the mysterious Patriots and the fates of characters like Raiden, Rose, EVA, Vamp and Meryl Sliverburgh being some examples.If you couldn't make sense of the above paragraph, then MGS4 is certainly not the game for you, as it has a convulted story that doesn't require you to have played previous games, but it sure helps a hell of a lot. Even with the fantastic gameplay, if you didn't like Metal Gear because of it's story before, then Metal Gear Solid 4 isn't going to change your mind.But if you are one of the many that enjoys Metal Gear Solid for it's story, then the fantastic gameplay is no longer an optional extra. The gameplay is now an integral, exciting and, most importantly; fun part of the game. With new additions such as the Octocamo, a suit that changes it's colour and texture based on the surface Snake is pressed up against, and the Metal Gear Mk. II, sneaking around the environment has never been more fun.But if you're the type of person to go in gun-ho, then you're not punished by it, and in some cases, rewarded for it. Not only does it offer a nice change of pace to sneaking, it can net you some Drebin Points (a form of currency used to buy and upgrade weapons) and you can ally yourself with the local militia, who are intent on taking down Liquid's private army.All of this looks and sounds fantastic. War-torn buildings and gritty textures populate the Middle Eastern setting, lush jungle environments with towering trees and beautiful rivers reside in other countries. With the sound of bullets whizzing past Snake's head, pummeling explosions and heart-stopping gunshots, you'll need to remind yourself that you're not playing a movie.MGS4 is one for the fans, but newcomers will find something they like. Although it has little replay value, and some may find Kojima's trademark humour a little tasteless, Metal Gear Solid 4 is an epic, action-packed, heart-pounding experience. Though there are some parts of the game that you are guaranteed to dislike, the clever boss battles, and some intense on-rails sequences will surely win you over. \",\n",

The story here is a alien race invades earth typical for a sci-fi game. The game starts out slow. You are in prision for an untold reason and is \"liberated\" by your comrades. You start off by either picking traning. (which i recomnd your do) or go straight to battle. The enviroments are PRETTY..Best graphics ive seen so far on my 360. Gameplay is usually fast and tactical..Hiding and firing from cover our you can rush the enemy with your chainsaw attached to your gun. Sounds are amazing. Great voice overs done by actors. The game is 59.99 and 69.99 for collectors edition but the game is worth it. I recmond all 360 owners get this game. If you like Really fast paced games probley not for you but if you like a mindless killing from behind cover kind of game then this is perfect for you. There are some collision issues.

       " {'deck': 'Mario Kart Wii is more Mario Kart, no more, no less.',\n",
       "  'description': 'In 1992, the Mario Kart series was released on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Since then, it has become one of Nintendo’s most popular series, along with Zelda, Metroid and the Mario series in general. The Kart series has made the racing genre much more accessible for everyone. Over the years, the series has been fine-tuned while still retaining its easy-to-pick-up play style. Now, with the introduction of the Wii and the motion-sensor controller, the Mario Kart series continues, and guess what? It’s more Mario Kart.  As previously mentioned, the Mario Kart series has been around since 1992 and since then, has grown to six games (eight if you count the arcade GP games.) With this many games out, the series is bound to repeat itself in a few areas, and for the most part, that’s fine. The Mario Kart series is known for it’s ability to be played with friends on the same console, which means there’s always plenty of fun to be had. Each Rainbow Road is as difficult and exciting as the last, and even unlocking the characters by yourself can be interesting enough to keep you playing for quite some time.  But this time around, Mario Kart Wii just seems like more of the same. As mentioned before, while this isn’t a bad thing overall, returning players will notice a lot of the same tricks and tracks designs from previous games. Some tracks almost feel like the same track from a previous game, but with a different theme and looked at through a mirror. While it’s not expected that each track be completely original and unique, it just feels like the designers copy and pasted a few tracks.  While some of the tracks may give a feeling of deja vu, there are 32 of them to pick from, so at least there’s a large selection. 16 of the tracks are new, while the other 16 are from previous Kart games. While the ability to choose is nice, some of the “retro” tracks that were selected aren’t all that popular from the previous games, so there isn’t much of an incentive to play them a second time around, since they weren’t all that great the first time around.  That being said, the retro tracks haven’t come in untouched. While many of the tracks (mainly the SNES/GBA tracks) have been translated into 3D, most of the previous 3D tracks feature some new additions to make them more in tune with the new additions in Mario Kart Wii. But while they have been modified slightly, the tracks will still look and play just as you remember them.  In addition to the 32 tracks, there are 25 playable characters in Mario Kart Wii, most of which you’ll have to unlock. Doing so is a great example of the kind of audience that the Kart series caters to. For some of the characters, you must simply finish the Grand Prix modes and finish in the top three. But for others, you must complete tasks that most Kart players wouldn’t even consider completing, which means there is a nice reward for the hardcore Kart players.  While Mario Kart Wii may cater very well to the hardcore player, it also tries to maintain it’s pick-up-and-play mechanics, which doesn’t cross over very well in a number of different ways. Especially in the 150CC races, the items become ridiculous, knocking a first place racer all the way down to 12th in a matter of seconds. Even though this may work to the players advantage, it mainly gives the AI the upper hand, since they have a greater chance of being behind you.  Even with the item problems, the algorithm behind the selection can seem off at time, especially during 1-on-1 races. Even though the player in second place is technically in last place, the game still gives them items as if they were in second place, giving them little or no chance to catch back up. This can become frustrating, especially if the gap between the players is quite large, making your defeat almost imminent.  On the topic of multiplayer, the Mario Kart Wii still retains the great local multiplayer that the game is known for. However, Battle Mode is now broken down into two teams, and when these games are taken online, they’re played on maps built for 12 players, rather than the four that are allowed. Also, when playing with three or more people on one console, the game cuts its frames-per-second in half, making it look not nearly as smooth as when one or two people are playing.  Outside of local multiplayer, online play has been introduced to the console Kart games, and it’s a vast improvement over previous Nintendo titles. Games begin quickly, and there is virtually no lag at all. You can race worldwide, in your country only or simply against a few friends. The friend code system is still in place, which means you’ll have to swap codes if you want to play with friends, but the whole experience is so much quicker and easier than previous attempts, that it can almost be overlooked.  In addition to playing online, there is also a new Mario Kart channel for your Wii that comes with the game. It contains leaderboards and stats from yourself and all of your friends. You can compare time trial scores, along with simply spectate current online matches. The channel works without the disc, which makes keeping up with the game rather simple.  Another thing that comes with the game is the wheel, which is one of the main draws of the new Kart. Most of the previous racing games make use of the Wii remote itself, but this time around, Nintendo has included an accessory that makes the experience that much more authentic. Along with the wheel, players can use the Gamecube/Classic Controller, along with the Wii remote and nunchauk. It’s all up to your preference, but the new wheel works just fine, especially since it comes free with the game.  The last large addition to Mario Kart Wii is the introduction of tricks, not to mention motorcycles. The trick system is quite easy, and gives players a short boost when they land one. There are jumps all over the courses to ensure that players will make full use of this system, especially when it comes to 150CC.  Also, bikes have been added into the series, and they feel completely natural. While karts can receive a second ‘level’ speed boosts, bikes can pop a wheelie on straightaways and recieve a slight increase in speed. Also, drifting is no longer determined by players jiggling their joysticks, which eliminates ’snaking’, giving new players a much better chance at winning online against experience players.  Aesthetically is where Mario Kari Wii shines the least. It doesn’t look much better than the version before it, and even the bystanders in stands, who consist of Miis from your console, are rendered in 2D, which shouldn’t really even be an option at this point. While a few details have been fine tuned, and the game itself runs very smooth, it just isn’t a large enough step ahead to be considered up-to-par. Audio-wise, Mario Kart Wii sounds like every Kart game before it, although the character sayings do begin to feel repetitive after landing tricks over and over.  Overall, Mario Kart Wii is more Mario Kart. No more, no less. The addition of online play is a nice addition, and in itself is worth getting the game for. So in the end, it comes down to one question: do you like Mario Kart? If the answer is yes, then pick up Mario Kart Wii, because it stays very true to the Kart formula and has plenty of replay value, but don’t expect to be amazed. If no, then I would still recommend looking into it. It’s a great game, and definitely a must own for the Wii owner who loves to party.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Ice chunks form on all sides of your ship, commanding all the attention of your crew for the task at hand. The quota has to be filled, but your boat also needs to stay afloat, so your crew is safe from your wrath–for now. After the ice has been cleared from the boat, you and your crew get to the real task at hand: fishing for crabs. Don’t get too excited, but don’t get too cynical either. It’s hard to sell a game about crab-fishing to groups of gamers that are used to action-packed games like Halo 3 or Metal Gear Solid 4. At first glance it seems akin to offering vegetables to child. Why would a testosterone-fueled 18-34 male want a game about fishing? Short answer is that Mr. 18-34 probably doesn’t. But a deeper look into the game reveals surprising depth for gamers out there that want to step back from action and have a more chilled experience. After a lengthy tutorial gets you acclimated to controlling the boats, you’re not ready to set sail for the Bering Sea quite yet. Crew members must be hired and provisions (bait, gas, fishing pots) must be purchased. With fresh supplies and an experienced crew, you plan out your fishing strategy. Checking your plotter, a device that allows you to check crab population, you map out your strategies to hit areas with the highest density. Marking your map with your planned strings, (swaths of sea where you drop your pots to “soak”) you and your crew make haste for that location. Once there, your crew gets to work, as do you. Getting the boat into position, you ring a buzzer, giving your workers the green light to drop the pot into the sea. You continue this strategy for a while, and your employees are starting to tire. Yet, you need to get these pots down as soon as possible. Meeting the quota is paramount to any sleeping concerns of these peasants. Not soon after, one of your workers makes an error, resulting in a steel pot being dropped from a crane and onto a fellow employee. The aftermath is not good–the injured employee was your deck boss and your most trusted and experienced crew member., who is now out for the season.The effect is much like a weigh scale. On one of the arms you have the need to meet the quota, and then on the other, the need to protect the safety of your crew. Finding the right balance is the challenge. Even with a key crew member down, you’re still able to continue. Completing your fishing strategy, you head back to harbor to find a replacement for your fallen deck boss. Luckily, there are still some unemployed, willing hands, which you promptly hire. Getting back to sea, you begin to retrieve your hauls. The first couple of hauls only bring in a miniscule number of “keepers” (adult crabs) and it continues along most of your strings. Frustrated, you radio other fisherman to see how they’re haul has been going. Listen closely, because not all of them are looking to help. This particular fisherman tells you that their fishing has gone great, even though they might have been fishing along the same strings you have been. Knowing how the fishing has gone for you, you make note to disregard whatever they say in the future. As you’re about to finish picking up the last of your ill-fated pots, something happens. Everything stands still. You figure it’s just a temporary lock-up. Tapping the guide button multiple times proves fruitless, so you reluctantly turn off your 360. It’s just bad luck, and hey, you saved just before the freeze, so everything’s kosher. Minutes later, it happens again. And again…ad nauseam. Progressing through a complete season of crab fishing seems impossible up to a certain point because of the technical difficulties that continue to muck up your experience. Glancing at screenshots of the game, shrugging it off as a quick, sloppy cash-in on the TV show would be an easy conclusion. Nothing looks particularly good and there is plenty that looks bad. Hauling in your catch of crab, the detail on the fish passes scrutiny while in the pot. But when dumped into the catching tray for your crew to sort, it becomes this amalgamation of brown slime and gunk that looks laughably bad. Re-creations of the different boats seen on the show are faithful, but technical prowess is something Deadliest Catch does not have. Graphical limitations aside, Deadliest Catch is surprisingly competent. In so far as games are vehicles for excitement and action, the game falls on its face. Where it finds its footing is in its unique setup that is unlike anything else on the market. Unique might not mean great or even good, but you could rent much worse.',\n",

       " {'deck': 'Sin and Punishment: A Flawed, but Worthwhile Shooter',\n",
       "  'description': \" With every generation of console games, there are always a few definitive games which, while classics, are never released outside of the land of the rising sun. Up until recently, Sin and Punishment was one such game. Coming out at the tail end of the lifespan of the Nintendo 64, the most exposure it had received until recently was within the hardcore gaming circle, within which it became a rather legendary game. Indeed, Sin and Punishment is yet another worthy shooter from critically-lauded development house Treasure. Although it may have serious issues with the amount of playtime and a lack of real difficulty, the game is otherwise a diamond in the rough which shouldn't be neglected by those of the Nintendo 64 generation.  Superficially, Sin and Punishment is not unlike a lot of Treasure's other offerings. A lot of time is spent simultaneously running and gunning numerous enemies in the hopes of reaching a level's end. In addition, the convention of a small, but memorable cast of characters used to tell most of the game's story is implemented once again. And of course, the battles are of a grand scope. To say that the game is therefore similar to Treasure's past offerings is hardly a stretch. However, it still stands on its own quite well, as it mixes several unique elements to create a brand of on-rails shooting not quite like anything else.  The most emphatic of these elements is that of Sin and Punishment's wonderfully diverse settings. Each stage takes place in completely different areas, which range from underground lava flows to desolate cityscapes to even beaches. To top it all off, every area plays host to epic, large-scale battles with plenty of things happening at any given time. As if that wasn't enough, though, the ways in which the battles are fought, much like the stages, vary from area to area, with each stage playing host to a unique method of doing so. In one moment, players could be fending off beastly bugs and other unsightly creatures by slowly creeping through a New York subway, while another will have them fighting Gunstar Heroes-style in a side-scrolling stage. This flair for individual style in the battles, as well as the usage of completely unique areas throughout the game's entirety, help make Sin and Punishment easily memorable long after finishing it.  What helps the game succeed in those regards, though, can be mainly attributed to the game's graphics. Put simply, without the help of the Nintendo 64's expansion pack, Sin and Punishment is one of the system's best-looking games. Not only does everything look sharp, considering the system's capabilities, but it all holds up very well. As mentioned earlier, there can be plenty of action on the screen and, thankfully, Sin and Punishment's frame rate is up to the job. It stays smooth even in very hectic situations, enabling the action to occur as it was intended. The graphics are also the piece which help make the levels feel cohesive and connected to each other. Even as players switch from one area to the next, the style in the game stays consistent, providing a reminder that, even if some of the gameplay has changed, it's still the same game. Plus, the game actually does a good job of making the scenery just as attractive to look at as the action on the battlefront.  To complement these characteristics, Sin and Punishment's sound design is also unorthodox for a Nintendo 64 game in that it uses a relatively prolific amount of voice acting. It may not be the only game on the console to do so, but it's one of the few where every line of dialog is vocalized. While the quality of the acting itself may be solid at best, the fact that quite a bit of it was crammed into an N64 cartridge is an achievement in and of itself. Oh, it's also in English with Japanese subtitles, as if there weren't enough elements which set the game apart from its brethren as it is. The other parts, the game's sound effects and music, aren't quite as unusual as the voice acting, but they get the job done, if nothing else.  The controls of Sin and Punishment also do a good job at keeping things relatively intuitive. Movement of the characters is done via the d-pad, while the control stick is used for the targeting cursor, the shoulder buttons are reserved for jumps, and the Z-button for shooting, as well as sword swipes for up-close encounters. It's a setup which, while fairly unusual, doesn't take long to get accustomed to and means that little fumbling ultimately takes place. In addition, there are two methods of aiming with the A and B-buttons, one which involves locking onto enemies and the other having manual aiming. Which method is picked affects how much damage each shot does, although that's about as deep as the differences between the two go. If there are areas in which Sin and Punishment could have improved, though, then they are most certainly in the game's difficulty and breadth, or lack thereof of both. The problem with the former is that it's overly easy, especially considering the genre in which it inhabits. Many of the enemies, even the bosses, can be taken down with ease. This is compounded by a liberal dosage of continues and health packs, which ensure that it shouldn't take no more than several tries to pass a stage, should one actually manage to die. For a game which has epic battles throughout the entire story, it just seems odd that the difficulty wasn't upped a few notches. In fact, it's completely possibly to beat the game without ever having to restart from the beginning. It's simply that liberal in its generosity. The bigger issue, however, is in the latter. Getting to the end on the default difficulty doesn't take much longer than an hour, even if the stages themselves don't feel overly brief. Although it ensures that Sin and Punishment doesn't wear out its welcome, the addition of a few more levels could only have been to the game's benefit. Just because the game may feel highly arcade-like in nature doesn't mean Treasure should have felt obligated to keep its time allotment just as meager.  Even with those issues, however, Sin and Punishment is still a game worth playing or even buying. As one of Treasure's few forays on the Nintendo 64, it's an excellent one which does a superb job at showing off the system's capabilities. With a combination of extremely diverse gameplay, great, rock-steady visuals, and voice acting, Sin and Punishment leaves quite a favorable impression that never fades during the brief playtime. It may have some serious problems with difficulty and brevity, but because those are really the game's only hindrances, it still comes out as quite an achievement and as one of the Nintendo 64's most memorable games in its roster. Gamers from that era, as well as on-rails shooter fans, shouldn't hesitate in picking up this gem, regardless of its cultural roots. \",\n",

       " {'deck': 'Vib-Ribbon: The Charming, if Somewhat Lacking Rhythm Game',\n",
       "  'description': \"The conventions employed by games within the music genre tend to be consistent across the board. Regardless of the catalytic instrument used, the gameplay ultimately boils down to simply matching some rendition of notes and/or beats with proper timing. In that respect, Vib-Ribbon is no different. However, a quick glance at the vector-style box art should be enough to indicate that Vib-Ribbon is really not that much of a conformist. It's a PlayStation import that not everyone will necessarily be able to enjoy, but those that have the right tastes will find a game whose charm makes up for its deficiencies.  What differentiates Vib-Ribbon from most of the other modern music games on the market can be found in the way in which Vib-Ribbon presents its content. Instead of solely being packaged with pre-programmed songs that are tweaked according to difficulty, the game lets players import any song they please from a music CD. There are indeed several songs from Japanese indie group Laugh&Peace included in the game which serve as introductions to Vib-Ribbon's content, but the vast majority of the value stems from using one's own music collection. Thankfully, Vib-Ribbon does a good job of being able to make its levels from the material with which it is provided. Although the game engine has a tendency to draw upon the bass, it'll also occasionally call upon vocals and other parts to mess around with timing. It's not a completely perfect implementation, but it's still well-done overall and makes the game worthwhile in that respect.  Vib-Ribbon's actual gameplay is probably its most defining characteristic outside of the music importation feature. Whereas other music games simply rely on hand-eye coordination involving abstract symbols, Vib-Ribbon uses the music to generate obstacle courses. The player, as the main character Vibri, has to successfully overcome several types of obstacles by using the shoulder buttons, down on the d-pad, and the X-button. Easy levels only include four different types of obstacles, which consist of a loop, a jagged line, a gap, and a rectangle and crossing them is simply a matter of hitting one of the previously-mentioned buttons correctly. Harder levels, however, also have combination obstacles, which incorporate two types of obstacles. Crossing them is a matter of determining which parts make up the combined obstacle and then hitting the respective buttons. It's an elegant control setup which becomes natural after several play-sessions and, indeed, getting familiar with the nuances of interacting with Vibri's hindrances is a must for harder songs.  All of that is essentially the core gameplay and doesn't change from song to song. However, the inherent difficulty level which certain songs may have can also bring about other mechanics. Faster songs, for example, may make the obstacles rotate while the camera is at a certain angle, which can make timing a tough matter. Other songs, however, may change the speed at which certain obstacles approach Vibri. At one moment, one might expect that a jagged line is the next thing to cross, but a rectangle may actually speed ahead of it and become the next target. The game also changes which direction Vibri is seen running, which is done mainly in intermissions which the game generates during a song to grant the player a small break. (That, however, is something which only shows up in the music CD-generated levels.) If necessary, the game also changes the tempo in timing with the music and makes the shapes move accordingly.  All of these mechanics can make for a harder experience in theory. However, most of them don't tend to pose much of a threat in practice. However, the difficulty can feel somewhat sporadic between songs. While some guesstimating can be done beforehand, it's not set in stone until the game actually starts running. The only indicator which the player receives beforehand is Vibri's pace. But because that takes place just moments before each song actually commences, it's usually too late. Thus, some surprises can show up when trying out different songs. Over the course of testing, there were a few instances where fast piano solos generated harder levels than things such as punk rock riffs. It's not too much of a detraction, but it can still be an unpleasant surprise nevertheless.  On a completely different note, the aesthetics of Vib-Ribbon are among the most unique in the PlayStation's offerings. Instead of colorful sprites or textured polygons, Vib-Ribbon opts for a simple vector-based style. Absolutely everything in the game, save for the development studio's logo, is done entirely with very defined white lines. Because it's a style which has virtually no presence in today's gaming, the meagerness of it doesn't actually hurt the game at all. The visuals also give Vibri a quasi-personality in and of itself, as no rabbit would be typically rendered in the manner that she is. (Depending on how well the player does, however, Vibri may either become something better or worse than a rabbit over the course of the game. Each of these different forms lend their own unique appearance with the vector lines as well.) In the end, it's a very modest graphics engine, but it's sufficient enough to convey what the game wants to get across as well as simultaneously give it plenty of flair to boot.  When considering that the game is a musical one, it should come to no surprise that it tackles that department well. The abstract sound effects and main menu music play just fine, as do Vib-Ribbon's packed-in songs. There also happens to be some very interesting voice acting for Vibri, which is done in jolly and psychedelic manner. Music which is imported from CDs also plays just fine and the audio quality sounds on par with any other CD player on the market. All told, Vib-Ribbon's music and sounds are good and solid, a task which is critical for a game within its respective category.  If there is one main gripe to be had about Vib-Ribbon, though, then it's the fact that the game is devoid of any real depth. The game's entirety consists of jumping over obstacles and listening to music and while those things may have been implemented well, the absence of other things to do robs it of a little value. Although a lot of motivation for playing it can come from seeing how it interprets one's own music, there's otherwise no other real reason to play the game. It's unfortunate in that respect. However, what is there does manage to be compelling and it compensates for that one major fault.  In the end, Vib-Ribbon is one of the more unique music games to have ever been conceived. Although its premise may ultimately be very short and sweet, it's one that is still rarely done in the industry today, let alone done well. Not everyone will necessary like this game for very obvious reasons and the main fault does hurt the game's potential. However, for those who are big music buffs and/or like their games developed on the more surreal side, Vib-Ribbon is a game worth playing. Just be sure to go into this experience knowing full well what this game has to offer.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Bullets whiz over your prone body as you sneak through the forest. Mortar fire can be heard in the distance, screeching above. The mortar strikes the ground with force, kicking up dust, dirt and debris, eliciting a wince. You keep going–after all, you’ve got a job to do. You continue your long, slow crawl through the muck. From the east comes a squadron of militia fighters who do not notice you hiding in some high grass. They push forward while you follow close behind, careful to not arouse suspicion. Soon enough, the rebels begin to engage private military corporation (PMC) troops that are entrenched in their base. Amidst the chaos, you start to circle around the battlefield, but soon find that your initial pathway is cut-off by a machine gun that will surely tear you to shreds if you continue on. Pulling back, you quickly check your map for another way to evade these two factions. Confirming that a hill to the west will do the trick, you slither to your destination, successfully evading all combat. Soon after, you’ll meet up with Drebin, a cool, calm, no non-sense kind of guy who will be your supplier of all sort of explosives, weapons, ammunition. Having access to Drebin’s shop will allow you to tailor your battlefield experience a bit. To be sure, Metal Gear Solid 4 is a stealth action game first and foremost, but there are some concessions here for someone who likes to run-and-gun, first and foremost being the tighter controls, while Drebin keeps you supplied with enough ammunition and firepower. After purchasing some much needed supplies, you forge ahead. Using your Solid Eye, which allows you to view where enemy forces are, (radar and binoculars) how concealed you are from them, as well as allowing an infra-red option to help you in the darker locales, you spot two PMC soldiers patrolling a road that you need to travel along. Swapping to your tranquilizer pistol, you take aim for the first. A shot to the neck drops him in one fell swoop. His partner turns around, puzzled at the sight of his fallen comrade. Before he gets a chance to investigate, you plug him with two tranquilizer shots…just to be safe. Staring at your pistol, you’re shocked at how easy the controls are than in past missions, and you’re thankful you’re not fighting from an over-head, top-down viewpoint. Laying still, you allow your “OctoCamo” suit to readjust to fit the terrain that you will be traversing up ahead. You move forward. Coming up to another PMC base, you take shelter behind a concrete block. You try to take cover behind it, in the hopes of being able to take pot shots at the enemy, then ducking back down into cover. Sadly, Snake wasn’t equipped with this seemingly basic ability. After infiltrating a compound for a person of interest, you make your way around another battlefield. A bulldozer for the now friendly militia (because you did not fire at them in previous parts of the game) is destroyed, slowing your progress to find this “person of interest.” Destination points on your mini-map direct you to destroy two doors that seemingly lead to where you have to go, though, it is clear after many attempts to bust down the doors that your map is mistaken. Instead, you will have to go elsewhere, as you mutter under your breath about the poor direction. This will not be the only time that poor direction will cause some discomfort, most noticeably when you encounter certain boss characters in the game. Not only poor direction, but an extremely “gamey” cheesiness comes into play during a specific boss encounter, where the solution does not necessarily logically flow. Through persistence, constant Codec calls to Otacon, or through a desperate search of online guides, you’ll eventually find the solution, but wish that the challenge was in the fight, rather than finding a convoluted weak point. This is the weakness of the second half of the game, which is heavier on boss fights and plot, rather than intense battlefield situations. For fans of Snake’s saga, this will not be a problem–for fans of the excellent gameplay that Metal Gear Solid 4 provides, it’s a bit of a let down. Inevitably, you’ll stumble into a cut-scene or two, which is where the bulk of the story unfolds. The game represents a wide swath of genres, from action, comedy, drama, romance, science fiction–Metal Gear Solid 4 has it all. In terms of pure cinematic quality, Metal Gear Solid 4 arguably has no equal in games. In terms of narrative quality, there can be some points of contention. Both melodramatic and insanely hard to follow at times due to the intricacy of the story that is being told, (especially to franchise rookies) the plot may turn off those that can’t suspend disbelief. Characters will commit acts that shatter reason, even within the context of an already “out there” storyline. Still, I could not help but to be thoroughly engaged in the way it was presented. The melodrama and the plot belie the realism that Metal Gear Solid 4 can provide. From snow covered areas under white out conditions that considerably hampers your vision, to the emotion that characters show in their face, Metal Gear Solid 4 presents a believable world. The intensity that you feel in your gut while you’re sneaking past enemy troops, or the shiver that goes up your spine when you’re spotted is very real. The landscapes, the sound of two competing factions barking orders at their fellow troops, the guns firing–all these components add to the gameplay in ways that are immeasurable. That’s really what Metal Gear Solid 4’s essence was about: the intensity of the fight. There are story elements that will please the hardcore MGS nuts and there are deeper, real-world themes explored here (though very beneath the surface, and it will vary from player to player what they get out of it) but the engaging cut-scenes are not what made Metal Gear Solid 4. It was fear. Fear of getting spotted. Fear of having to fight. Fear of failure. That intense, gut feeling powered the game throughout, and the story and well crafted cut-scenes round out an excellent game. Fan or not, Metal Gear Solid 4 deserves to be played. ',\n",

The game is pretty addicting you move around 10 diffrent worls with 100 missions each and deliver food to people with stealh and ninja like skills. You start out in a construction site giving Biscuits away. There is no story line accept there are some hungy people that need food. So your charcter is \"the king\" himself. Gameplay is very fun using Splinter Cell like tactics (without the violence) to get past people to get to your target. the game looks horrible and the sounds is not much better either. but the game is 4.99 and fun so go to burger king and buy it.. If you can get past all the ban sounds and graphics you have a fun stealth based game. ',\n",

       " {'deck': \"Okami: A Swan Song Most Worthy of Clover's Name\",\n",
       "  'description': \"Created in a time when venerable developer Clover Studio was on its last legs, Okami is a game which naturally burdens itself with a number of expectations. Not only does it come after a line of well-loved Viewtiful Joe installments from the same developer, but an uncanny resemblance to other recent action-adventure games also raises the stakes for the quality which is to be expected from this game. Thankfully, though, Okami not only meets these standards, but often far exceeds them. The game may not be overly innovative, but thanks its method of following and executing genre trademarks extremely well, Okami turns out to be Clover Studio's most solid title to date. Additionally, its highly stylized visuals, beautiful soundtrack, and incredibly well-written localization show that it not only stands well against similar games, it's among the best in recent years. Make no mistake: Okami may superficially appear to be like many other games. But at its core is a very, very different beast.  Okami is one of the few games to hit western shores which is utterly steeped in Japanese mythology. Few moments ever pass throughout the entire game that remind one that it is indeed of Asian origin. While this would normally be an impediment for the average gamer who isn't versed in such tales, Okami does a superb job at making sure everyone is on the same page throughout the entire story. Characters and plot sequences always receive their due explanation, allowing the unenlightened to catch up very easily. On top of that, the mythology is introduced only in bite-sized pieces. This enables players to become familiar with what they know over time so they can then move onto other facets of the mythology more easily and, by the end, feel utterly immersed in the world which Okami has created.  The technique is introduced from the get-go. The beginning of the game starts off basic enough. 100 years prior to the game's beginning, Amaterasu, the Japanese sun god, as a wolf, defeated an eight-headed snake named Orochi (with some help) in order to free Kamiki Village from the task of annually sacrificing a maiden. Consequentially, though, Amaterasu died in the process and a memorial was set up in her place inside the village. However, when a bloke inadvertently lets Orochi loose again, Amaterasu is subsequently reincarnated to once again do the work she performed a century ago.  There is, however, a major difference between the old wolf and the new one: The latter lacks special powers she had when fighting Orochi. These powers form the fundamental foundation for what helps to define Okami's gameplay. Instead of being typical godly powers a la superheroes and the like, these powers are activated through the use of a brush. When used correctly, this brush can perform a variety of things that no mortal could ever dream of doing, at least easily. Amaterasu, though, has lost virtually all of these powers and must search for them again in addition to her Orochi-related duties.  The game is kind, though, and relents the first few powers early on. Things such as restoring broken or lost things and slashing are soon accessible in the beginning of the game. Over time, Amaterasu acquires other abilities to use in tandem with her brush, such as lightning strikes, wind gusts, and cherry bombs, among others. Each power is well-used and has its own applications both during times of exploration and combat, as they get used in very clever ways throughout each portion. Activating these powers is extremely easy, requiring only the tap of a button to bring up a canvas and then proceeding to draw the desired symbol. Using the brush takes up ink and only a limited amount of it can be used for each drawing. However, it does regenerate quickly enough and usually runs out only when the powers are used liberally in a given situation.  The brush isn't the only tool at Amaterasu's disposal, though. Several different types of weapons, ranging from blades to chains to shields (yes, shields) are available. Each weapon in the game can either be equipped as the main weapon or as the sub-weapon, which has implications on the weapon's abilities in battle and vary greatly depending on how they're assigned. Because the amount of ink the game grants players is limited, even after upgrades, one will be relying heavily on these weapons during combat. The combat itself is what one would expect from a modern action-adventure game, consisting of running up to enemies, hitting them, blocking their reply, and repeating the process. Brush usage notwithstanding, the mechanics of Okami's combat will be very familiar to anyone who has played similar games. With the brush, though, an extra spice is added and, oftentimes, using the brush is a requirement when fighting against certain enemies, as they are weak to certain powers. These weaknesses can often be found just by using some logic after looking at their designs and it adds a very rare element of puzzles outside of the exploration aspect of such games. There are other nuances to the combat, such as item collection, but much of it optional and not experiencing them doesn't detract from playing the game. Fighting is usually a rather easy affair in the game, though. (It's very possible for one to not even die once throughout the entire game.) But, as a consolation to those who may want to avoid possible tediousness, one can get out of many battles, although this has consequences of its own.  The exploration part of the game is also reminiscent of other action-adventure games. Okami provides a very large world to delve into and even the beginning areas where players are confined to are vast and rich with secrets. Over time, other areas are unlocked, each one being more unique than the last. Before the conclusion is reached, Okami shows locations as different as a quaint village and an underwater city, as well as many other imaginative places in-between. The game also has its share of dungeons. However, unlike games such as The Legend of Zelda, dungeon crawling is only a relatively occasional affair, showing up just often enough to show that it's there without being overdone. Even amidst such scant showings, though, the dungeons are just as excellently designed as all of the other areas in the game. Each one has its own very distinct theme which often defy the stereotypes commonly seen in other games. The puzzles, even with their low difficulty, are very creative and fit in well with its respective environment. Not one looks unnatural in its setting, allowing the dungeons to be distinct while still feeling a part of Okami's world.  While the combat and exploration aspects of it may be derivative of games which have come before it, few games implement both so well. The mechanics driving each are so solid that the idea of fixing what isn't broken is something which actually works to Okami's advantage. It doesn't toy with the action-adventure formula of today, but instead uses it as a very steady foundation and it does an excellent job at doing so. This is one of the few games which doesn't need innovation to be truly enjoyable, since the familiarity is so finely executed that it raises the standard for which other games in the future should follow should they choose a similar path. Okami is that enjoyable; it makes one forget that it doesn't innovate the gameplay in its own genre.  This is not to say that Okami doesn't pioneer areas in gaming other than gameplay. Visually, the game is one of the most artistically striking games this past generation. It embraces its Japanese background in every conceivable manner. This is most easily seen in the game's employment of cel-shading, which evokes a style commonly seen in old Japanese paintings. Each model and texture is outlined in a thick black, with colorful palettes to boot. Absolutely everything receives its due artistic treatment, allowing the reality to immerse anyone in its mythological setting with ease. Okami also happens to be one of the PS2's most beautiful games to date. In fact, it's almost even too hot to handle for the system. The graphics push the system almost near breaking point and, in one area, this is clearly seen in a very slight frame rate drop. But beyond that, the system handles the game like a charm, granting an easy ticket to a world of eye candy.  The sounds and music of the game are also done with an equal caliber. The former does its best to make sure everything sounds the way it should, while imposing its own flair at the same time. Dialog, while text based, has each character vocalizing their lines in a unique jargon, much like Animal Crossing's animalese. But unlike Nintendo's game, Okami uses this speech to help make each character unique without ever saying an actual word. One can even pick up imitations of things such as French accents through this use of quasi-speech. As for the latter, Okami's music uses a full orchestra and utterly everything is done in this manner. Even tiny ditties garner such quality. The lengthier musical pieces are where the high quality really shines above all, though. Theme songs, background music, and the like all have excellent compositions on par with even the best in other entertainment industries. Many of the major pieces are also used sparingly, too, preventing the music from ever growing repetitive. But, like Okami's graphics, what its music really does best at is embracing its Japanese background. Japan-centric instruments are often key players in the game's music and are used to their full potential. It works just as hard as all of the other fundamental pieces of the game to establish this myth-centric world and it most certainly succeeds in that objective.  Okami also has mastery over something much less emphasized in most games: localization. Few games that receive a translation today get one which goes above and beyond doing the straightforward. This is arguably what is most memorable about Okami. Every line of text, every speech, and every description has a level of polish which shows that time, effort, and love went into making the game accessible and appealing to non-Japanese audiences. Besides simply making the mythology understandable to the uninitiated, the localization defines one's experiences with Okami's denizens. Every single character, from the major to the very modest (including unnamed ones), receives their own word style and feel very developed. In particular, Issun, a character who tags along with Amaterasu on her quest for much of the game, is one who shows how beneficial a thorough localization can be for players. His speech overflows with his bubbling, vivacious personality that never fails to entertain throughout the 30-plus-hour-long journey. Touches like giving life to the characters is why Okami's localization is something which ought to be lauded as much as its more external characteristics such as graphics and sound. It's just that excellent.  Okami is an wonderful swan song for Clover. It takes everything which an action-adventure game should be and executes it beautifully. Combine that with almost near-perfect quality in graphics, sounds, music, and localization and you have a game which needs to be experienced to be fully appreciated. Don't be bogged down by its mythological background or its lack of substantial innovation. For every minor issue which Okami has, it more than makes up for the flaw elsewhere in spades. This a game which truly does have something for everyone to enjoy. Simply put, Okami shows how far gaming can go not only artistically, but also in terms of fun. If you have a PS2 and even the slightest inkling to experience something very unfamiliar in seeming familiar territory, then Okami is most certainly going to be your cup of tea, and a superb one at that.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'After my scathing review of the demo, and various other reviews I did afterwards, I guess I don’t have any hate left to spare for this game. I enjoy it tons, for some reason. And in case I have not enough reviewed this title… Some things I have not yet covered (shocking, I know). I dig how you can replenish lost grenades and ammo by running over a dead foes supplies (ammo through specific class only); the limited splash damage (which emphasizes precision); distinct classes; and persistent and constant accomplishment (wildcards, patches, and trophies). I think Bad Company handles challenges and rewards the best out of itself, Call of Duty 4 and Rainbow Six: Vegas 2. I never get tired of the sound effect and dangling reward. Just for the uninitiated, the game rewards you trophies for accomplishing tasks (i.e., 3 kills with an anti-tank mine, 5 kills with transport vehicle, healing team mates, etc.). Patches unlock by fulfilling multiple trophies (Bronze Support Patch is dangled after fulfilling 2 kills as Support, 1 LMG efficiency trophy, 1 medic trophy, and 1 combat engineer trophy). If those weren’t enough, BFBC also features Wildcards that unlock and dangle by fulfilling rare and exotic tasks (i.e., 100 headshots with any sniper rifle, destroy 3 vehicles of same kind and 2 of another, 50 Avenger trophies, etc.). By allowing these accomplishments to be acquired multiple times infinitely, it rewards play and extends gameplay. I think the Call of Duty series should adopt it. I also appreciate how knife kills must be earned and earn a reviewable database of dog tags. The points system is also preferable featuring special points for avenging team mates, destroying vehicles, healing team mates, and other various tasks. I read reviews that state this distracts from objectives and encourages the lack of teamwork. I disagree. This is where the weakened firepower benefits gameplay as kills must be earned. Since kills are not guaranteed, working to accomplish an objective, say arming a charge, is a good way to score points (30 guaranteed points for successfully destroying a crate). An improvement would be adding more default guns per class. Each team has a different gun design but those guns share the same values. Only unlockable guns (promotional and progressive) offer more variety amongst gun values. More progressive unlockable guns would also be appreciated; more multiplayer modes would be also be nice. While an initial grievance, the weakened firepower works with this title. If the guns were more powerful, it would unbalance gameplay. What does need to be tweaked is the range of a few guns. The shotguns need less range, for instance. Bad Company is a nice way to spend time waiting for World at War, SOCOM, and Gears 2. Now, if only they’d soon release the damn update said to improve the party mode, offer clan support, and other fixes and updates.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Does running around blowing things up, riding helicopters, jumping from car to car and parachuting from jets in a 10000 km squared tropical island sound good to you? Well, then this is the game for you. It does lack a serious, long story and is flawed, but is still fun in many ways. Let me start with the story. The setting is great; a tropical island ruled by a political tyrant. But once you actually get into the story it isn\\'t so fun with a boring script, an unlikable main character and pretty underwhelming cinematics. So the story isn\\'t great and it doesn\\'t really spoil the game, but hopefully in the second game they will improve this small hindrance. So the campaign is satisfactory at best and it quite easy to get through, but instead of getting harder as you get through, it just gets longer. It also involves a lot of getting from point A to B and then to C and back to A. Getting from the different missions can take a while, even by plane, but Avalanche have inserted a nice touch where you can either get your \"agency\" to drop you a vehicle wherever you are or get them to pick you up and drop you off at one of the numerous bases or campaign mission starting points. The side missions, involving helping the guerrillas and the drug baron, are different. While helping the guerrillas you liberate villages and towns by creating havoc, which is quite fun. But the rest of the normal missions (as well as the drug baron missions) get boring and unoriginal fast. Though I have been complaining a lot there are some fantastic ideas and other stuff which work really well. Being a one man army is great in some ways, because you can survive barrages of bullets and fall from great heights, you can jump out of a plane and hang on the tail or you can get in a super fast bike go off and cliff and pull out your parachute just before falling to a bloody mess. Being able to always fling yourself into the air makes you feel like a kind of superman, with guns. The game looks fantastic especially when the sun rises or sets, and there is only about a 10 second loading screen at the beginning with no stopping for buffering as you fly through the huge island. If anything I would like to see the amazing engine sold to some other publishers. I think Avalance have put a lot of effort into this but they just haven\\'t put it together, this could have been a classic. All they really need is a better mission structure and perhaps a more detailed and smaller island with more going on. Maybe even a better story. Also, the gameplay is okay and not fitted really for keyboard and mouse and so if somebody has an xbox 360 as well as their PC, get the xbox 360 version instead.

       " {'deck': 'ICO: Simplistic in Design, Yet Profound in Implementation',\n",
       "  'description': \"In a genre which has been as consistently crowded as the action-adventure for years, it can be incredibly difficult to make a game which not only stands out, but also has mechanics which work well and make the experience a rewarding one. Whereas most start with the category's basic foundation and then build upon and elaborate on that, ICO often does quite the opposite to great success. Eschewing complicated systems and instead preferring a vast amount of simplicity, the game tasks players with only the absolute bare necessities at all times and takes care of the rest itself. The resulting piece, while definitely on the short side, is a superb example of where successful implementation of a game's vision is most important for its overall effectiveness and quality. ICO certainly knows what it is doing in that respect and as such comes out as being something wonderful which needs to be experienced by any and all who truly understand the unique abilities of the video game medium.  The premise of ICO and the primary motivation for moving onward are simplistically one and the same. Having both been trapped in a castle for their own respective reasons, the titular character and his companion, a girl by the name of Yorda, must find a way to escape and go out into the world. That alone may not necessarily sound thoroughly original, but the game's minimalistic style of storytelling allow it to still nevertheless feel unique. What it lacks in depth is made up for in spades in immersion, as the player is given the chance to weave their own sub-tale of sorts as they become more and more attached to Yorda.  The literal version of that attachment is actually one of the two defining aspects of ICO's gameplay. As one traverses through the castle, they are often holding hands with the girl in an effort to stay together. This is especially a necessity during times of combat, in which the castle's shadowy minions obsess over retrieving Yorda and preventing her escape from coming to fruition. Moments when she is forcefully separated from the player are incredibly tense ones, as everyone's livelihoods ultimately rest on her survival. Even when there is not any actual fighting to be done, though, moments when there is not direct contact with Yorda are still anxiety-inducing, as being away from her has its own shares of implications, even when it is needed in order to proceed forward. A bond is formed between Ico/the player and Yorda to such an extent that it is difficult not to care about her. This is despite the fact that it is impossible to verbally communicate with Yorda because she does not speak the same language as the protagonist, further emphasizing the need to be together as often as possible.  The other defining facet of ICO's gameplay is its almost complete reliance on environmental puzzles. While certain mainstays such as the movable block are present, many others are more natural to the game's setting and as such require that creativity be used during the solving process. It all looks as though it is part of a castle, first and foremost, and while few puzzles require a lot of thought, none of it is overly blatant, either. From the purposes and abilities of each acquirable weapon to what can be used as climbing surfaces, the player must often derive the underlying context of why something is there in order to get past the current obstacle and proceed to the next one. Thankfully, the process is consistently smooth with little backtracking whatsoever, making ICO a fairly linear game despite initial appearances.  What really helps set ICO vastly apart from virtually every other game in the action-adventure genre is its attention to detail in a number of oft-overlooked areas. Yorda is where a lot of this can be found and, if she's given enough mind, can be the source of minute awe-inspiring moments that are not directly related to the gameplay. If left to her own devices, for example, she may go off on her own and look at the scenery or watch some bird fluttering about in the current area. Or, if the player inadvertently hits a wall with their sword or stick, she might yelp in fright. She always manages to consistently show depth in areas where other tag-alongs in video games have been historically lacking. It is these and other such nuances in the game that ensure that the game's minor things stand out just as well as its major ones. They add plenty of spice to a flavor which is already highly exotic.  Graphically, ICO emphasizes its environments and animations over everything else. The former, while having clearly aged since the game's 2001 release, still hold up very well stylistically. They do not necessarily push the PlayStation 2 to its breaking point, but they are still well-crafted and deserve plenty of applause for ensuring that nothing ever looks monotonous despite the singular nature of the setting. ICO's animations are a very nice extension of its devotion to detail, as they often capture even more little things which could easily be missed without a close inspection. From the hesitant delicacy which Yorda clearly has before clearing major jumps to the manner in which clothing is toyed around by the wind, the animations in the game are very well crafted. Other parts of the game's visuals such as character models do not have quite such lofty standards, but nevertheless manage to be stylish in order to make up for that fact. The frame rate also stays steady for the majority of the gameplay, with only slight falters in very few instances.  ICO's sound design can only be accurately described as very deliberate. The majority of the playing time is spent without music, leaving the ambiance up to the environments. When it actually is present, it is always very low-key, being well-composed without overstepping its bounds and breaking into something overly (and unnecessarily) symphonic. Despite its seemingly obvious absence, the music is not something which is missed over the course of the gameplay, as those previously-mentioned ambient sounds succeed at immersing the player in the game's world. The game also employs a small amount of voice acting. Fictional languages are used for the verbal portion and they too do not go above and beyond their limits, which works perfectly fine. Corresponding subtitles are issued, although it should be noted that Yorda's are not in any earthly language whatsoever.  The scope of ICO's achievements are profound. Few games before it have been able to abide by a minimalistic design mentality and actually have that work to their benefit. But because it always knows exactly what it wants to do in every conceivable area, ICO's vision shines through very vividly and because of that fact, its merits allow it to stand tall as one of the few games whose essence truly will endure historical wear and tear. It is not only a testament to the legacy which the PlayStation 2 is bound to leave behind, but also a testament to the unique characteristics which only video games can wield. Consider it a must-play for anybody interested in how flexible the medium can be and how that affects its profoundness in myriad ways.\",\n",

You start out as a \"special forces\" soldier tasked with \"special high risk jobs\" It starts out buggy right at the beginning. You are in your room on your ship and they call your name over the loudspeak to come to the commander for a \"special mission\" to turn the power back on by pressing the f key. After that you are deployed to the ground. Then the game crashes. 3 patches AND IT STILL HAS NOT BEEN FIXED!!! You can bring the game back up after that. One very cool thing about this game is over 1000 bugs coming at you at once. Very good graphics and guns and bugs are detailed. Take a look at your friends. There faces are small blocks with a 2 dots and a line for a mouth. WTF is wrong with the designers at Stranglite where they high when they made this game.Sounds sucks. The guns sound like water pistols the people have the same voice and the bugs make one sound. The game is a cheap 20 bucks and comes with a cool poster and art book.The good. 100s of bugs at once,lots of goreThe bad: everything else accept what i said above. ',\n",

       "  'description': \"There are not many who lament the loss of the arcade space-shooter. With the great advances in visual technology over the years, it seems a strange choice for a developer to step back a couple of decades and hearken back to a simpler time. But that is exactly the premise behind Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved, as the popular Xbox Live Arcade game makes the transition to the PC.As expected Geometry Wars' graphics are nothing to write home about. The style is reminiscent of retro games, but it has been given a modern makeover. Featuring a simple 2D perspective it places the focus much more on game play, although this isn't necessarily a bad thing. In recent times, the emphasis for developers has been on creating the most visually realistic experience possible, the basic vector graphics featured in Geometry Wars therefore may put off many a modern gamer. Despite this, it does still look incredibly aesthetically pleasing; the bright neon colours contrast well with the space-theme backdrop, and the explosions look impressive.Simple but addictive game play is what's on offer here and it pays off in abundance. Many hours can be whittled away playing Geometry Wars; it really does have a lot to offer. This has a great deal to do with the variety of different enemies you come up against, each of them behaving in a different way. The learning curve is particularly harsh, with enemies spawning at a faster and faster rate in a short amount of time, but this only serves to get you more hooked once you have mastered the basics. You will battle against an abundance of adversaries, from the electric-blue diamond shapes that hone in on you, to bright-red black holes that suck in anything around them until they explode, unleashing a wave of debris that swarms over the screen.The music does get repetitive after a couple of hours of play, but more often than not it is drowned out by the torrent of laser fire. It does serve the purpose, however, of effectively accentuating the futuristic setting, it blends in well. The soundtrack also helps to build up the tempo of the game making for a more engaging experience. The audio feature serves as an integral role in the game as each enemy emits a different sound effect when it spawns. Because of this, it means that Geometry Wars engages you on multiple levels; it is difficult not to become immersed in the experience, a worthy accolade for any game.Unfortunately, the PC version lacks a great deal of features that made the Xbox 360 version so appealing. It doesn't have any form of achievement points, which means the game loses out somewhat in terms of the longevity factor. Moreover, the lack of online leader boards achieves the same effect. You lose the competitive aspect that was so prominent on the original, and as a result, the replay value of the game is affected. It is also rather cumbersome playing with a keyboard and mouse, the Xbox 360 version offered more freedom in this respect, the game is much more suited to playing with a controller.Whilst it is clear that this adaptation of the game is inferior to that of the Xbox 360, it has enough redeeming qualities to make it a worthwhile purchase for those new to the concept. With its blend of fun, exciting game play and simple graphics, Geometry Wars is a great tool for procrastination by anyone's standards.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Staring at the clock, you consider starting another match. “Hey, I’ll just set things up for when I play tomorrow!” you say. Three hours later, you’ve finished another Civilization Revolution match, and you’re left wondering where the time went. Sounds like a Civilization game, doesn’t it? If you’re a veteran of the series, that’s music to your ears. That’s always the concern with PC strategy games making the jump to consoles — does it feel like the PC game? Too many times gamers have been double-crossed by game companies selling them soy milk, claiming it to be “just like the real thing!”, only to have gamers take a swig of the soy milk, spit it out, get pissed off and run to message boards to bitch about the bad taste left in their mouth. (All apologies to soy milk fans) That is to say that Civilization Revolution wasn’t stripped down to be “like” the real thing — it is. Saying Civilization Revolution is a Civilization game comes with all the positives and negatives associated with the franchise. Civilization Revolution, like previous Civilization games, can be ridiculously addicting, causing you to lose yourself for hours and hours planning out how best to dominate the world. Because it’s a turn-based strategy game, it has the feel, much like an MMO, of “I can do this task really quick and then I’ll be done.” But after you complete that task, two more tasks come to your attention and it starts to snowball from there. The addictive qualities are thanks in large part to the in-depth strategy that the Civilization franchise is known for. There are four different ways for you to win: military, financial, cultural and technological dominance. Each of the four victory paths have different objectives for you to aim for (military dominance, for example, has you taking over all of the other civilization‘s capitals), so tailoring what you build and research is key to reaching victory.Keeping up with what units to build, technology to research, cities to attack, etc., can sometimes make newcomers to Civilization feel like a freshly hired waiter at a busy restaurant. You’re juggling two different trays, not trying to drop the customer’s food, while still trying to get there quickly in the hopes they give you a nice tip after they’re done feasting. Eventually, a customer with a full bladder gets up to go to the bathroom, bumps into you and makes you drop everything, killing all your work. Civilization Revolution can be the same in that way — you do a lot of work to set your army up, you plan out your attack on a neighboring city, and then the other civilization’s defenses are vastly superior to your expectations, crushing your planned “tip” for all that work. For newcomers like myself, learning what units to build and what technologies to research can be overwhelming at first, but when you finally get the hang of things and capture a city that you had been longing for, it makes the journey completely worth it — even if it was a bit messy getting there. In addition to the standard offline single-player, there are scenario missions and a “game of the week” — a randomly generated new scenario for players. The game of the week is the same for everyone, and each week you can compete with others to get the highest ranking on online leaderboards. Online multiplayer is also included for up to three other players, It runs smoothly and without any lag issues, but might not be ideal if you don’t have a couple hours to dedicate to the match. Audio-visually, Civilization Revolution is neither here nor there. The music isn’t memorable, and the characters speak in this Sims-like gibberish that gets a little grating. Visually, you’re getting a decent looking game considering the scope, but it’s not going to “wow” you. Surprisingly, though, I did experience some significant slow-down in the game on a couple occasions, leading me to believe my console had frozen — instead, the game had screeched to a complete halt for about 10 seconds. Although the slowdown was puzzling, it only happened twice and never got in the way of the game. The highest praise you could give a game like Civilization Revolution is to say that it plays like its PC counterparts. It might not be for everyone, but for the hardcore strategy fan, you finally have a console strategy game that isn’t broken and busted. Instead, you’re getting the same addicting, deep gameplay you’ve seen on the PC. Drink up — you’re not getting soy milk for once — you’re getting the real thing.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Unreal Tournament III was originally released in the fall of last year for the PC and PS3. Now, UT3 graces the Xbox 360 with its fast and furious gameplay, but is it worth shelling out $60 dollars for? UT3 for Xbox 360 comes with all the downloadable content available for the PS3 and PC versions of the game along with 2 new characters, 5 exclusive maps, split-screen multiplayer and Online Co-Op via Xbox Live.  UT3 offers multiple modes and options to choose from when you first boot up the game. You can go through UT3’s rather mediocre single player mode, own or be owned in the Instant Action mode where you make the rules and take on some bots or take the fight online in the fantastic multiplayer mode. The single player mode is mediocre at best and has a laughable story that is really there just to give you an incentive to keep pushing forward. The single player is split up into five main chapters and a tutorial. To be honest though, the entire single player experience feels more like tutorial then an actual campaign. Each chapter starts out with a cutscene and you choosing one of multiple “missions” which are really just multiplayer matches against bots. The single player is rather easy on the standard difficulty settings, but if you are up to the challenge you can try to complete the game on the harder difficulties. The enemy AI isn’t bad, but it isn’t great either. Enemies will take cover, but always seem to know exactly where you are. Your partner AI seems to be rather dumb at times. In Capture the Flag for example: your partners will rarely get the flag and even when they do you’ll often see them trying to kill the other team instead of making a run for your own base. Even when they aren’t they will rarely score a point. The single player altogether felt like it was put there just for the sake of having a single player mode, it’s nice, but was it really needed?   Unreal Tournament is a series known for its excellent multiplayer and fast and furious gameplay. UT3 on the 360 is no different. The Xbox 360 version of UT3 includes a split-screen multiplayer mode that is a fantastic addition to the game that works flawlessly and is great when you have a couple of friends over and just want to maim and destroy each other with Rocket Launchers in Morbias Arena. Getting into an online match is simple. Select the multiplayer option in the menu and either choose the “Quick Match” option or “find server”. You can change your search settings to match what you are looking for. You can also host your own matches with your own rules and settings. Once online, depending on the match type, you basically just frag the other team as much as many times as you can till you win. Boasting a ton of maps and multiple game modes ranging from your traditional deathmatch to the new Warfare mode, multiplayer is what really makes UT3 shine.  Unreal Tournament III, like its predecessors, has some very fun and excellent gameplay. Not a whole lot has changed since the last game, it’s still the same fast frag fest that you come to know and love. Classic Unreal Tournament weapons make a return in UT3, from the Bio Rifle to the Rocket Launcher. UT3 also has multiple vehicles that you can utilize on the battlefield. Turning in vehicles is very similar to that of Halo 3; you move your aiming reticule in the direction that you want to go and use the left stick to move in the desired direction. This can be a bit of a pain at times, but after some time you will get used to it. Unlike many FPS’s on the market you do not need to reload, you can carry more than 2 weapons and there are no grenades. Pick up a gun, some ammo and unload. As you pick up ammo it is automatically added to your gun so that it doesn’t slow down the overall pace of the game. Controls are you what you would expect. Shooting is mapped to the right trigger with the alternate fire on the left trigger, jumping to A, and switching weapons is done by either pressing the right bumper to move to the next weapon in your inventory or by holding the left bumper which brings up a weapon wheel which you then select the weapon you want to use via the left stick. UT3’s gameplay is fun for many reasons. One: it’s fast, two: it’s got many weapons and maps, and most important of all it’s fun as hell.  Unreal Tournament III runs on Epic’s excellent Unreal 3 engine. This engine powers many games that boast amazing visuals such as Epic’s own Gears of War and Unreal franchises, but also the masterpiece that is BioShock. UT3 looks absolutely gorgeous...most of the time. There are times where slowdown rears its ugly head, but this doesn’t really affect the gameplay as it only appears for a very brief moment or two. A lot of the texture work isn’t as great as it could be, but it’s hardly noticeable unless you decide to stop and look at something for a moment which will then be followed up by you getting blown up by a Flak Cannon, not recommended. There isn’t a whole lot to say on the audio side of things. The voice work is good, but cheesy and the music that plays during matches is a bit repetitive, but hardly noticeable as you’ll most likely only be focusing on not getting your head blown off by some guy (or girl) running around with a sniper rifle. One thing that the Xbox 360 version of UT3 doesn’t have that the PS3 and PC versions do is user created mods. This is something that the UT series is also known for and it is extremely disheartening that it didn’t make it into the game.  Bottom Line: Unreal Tournament III is a great first-person shooter with a fairly mediocre single player mode, but truly shines when you dive into the robust multiplayer mode that the series is known for. The lack of user mods is really disappointing (we can blame Microsoft for that one), but despite that, Unreal Tournament III is a great game boasting top notch visuals and gameplay and is something any FPS fan should look into getting.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Gameplay Basically the games consists of two type of gameplay strategy where you play as an angel shooting arrows to kill demons, performing tasks for the villagers and hack and slash where you as God himself kick demon butt using your sword and magic. The strategy works by first you choose a location to start on there will be a few demons and a temple you kill the demons which gives you more people you then direct the growth of the people towards the demons so they can seal them then the people will eventually uncover some sort of evil and you as God have to go down and finish the job! The hack and slash is pretty much self explanatory there is some light platforming in the levels and enemies are thrown at you but you never feel overwhelmed by them as your guy seems just powerful enough to take anyone down.  Graphics Graphically the game is quite stunning for the SNES the enemies all have different designs and the levels range from a desert to snowy mountains. Judging graphics for older games is hard as you have to try and put yourself back into the time it was released. Basically it’s like a quite high end GBA game.  Sound  The Audio in this game is great from the noises the demons make down to the music. The music is just what you expect from a enix game it’s really quite epic and they have memorable tunes you'll be humming to for some time.  Value Well if you’re a collector you’re definitely going to want and track this game down it’s a classic and something of a rarity. Plus there is some replay value to it experimenting with the development of people but only slightly as that aspect of the game isn’t very deep.  Overall anyone who is a fan of hack and slash games will definitely want to check this out as it mixes in strategy elements quite well, plus collectors are going to want to add this game to fill the void in their collection. This is one game to look out for on the Wii!\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Believe it or not, stealth action games haven’t always been around. Not until 1998 would the gaming world be set ablaze, with the now infamous Metal Gear Solid. The series itself spans the course of decades, and has since received both the praise and ridicule of many, due to its dialogue-heavy storyline. And just five years after its initial release, someone at Konami apparently thought it was a good time to release a remake of the classic tale—and thus Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes was born.The story of Metal Gear Solid is about as saturated and provocative as they get, so large that it couldn’t all fit within one game. Although the game starts out simple enough, don’t let it fool you; the plot quickly becomes a tangled web. The game puts players in the shoes of a government agent of sorts, attempting to thwart a nuclear catastrophe. As Solid Snake, you are forced out of early retirement and back into the field. A group of next-generation Special Forces has taken over a nuclear disposal facility on the Alaskan isle, Shadow Moses. They’ve taken some important hostages and are making demands, posing a nuclear threat to the United States if they don’t cooperate. To further complicate matters, they’re being led by the elite unit FOXHOUND, a group of complete nut-cases. This structure is really just a forefront to something greater, as throughout the course of the game Snake will grow as a human, learn to asses his surroundings, and shape his own destiny—as well as his enemies.The core of the gameplay pits you in a third-person perspective, where you take action against enemy soldiers patrolling the facility. It’s like putting a kid in a candy store, where everything is for the taking, which in this case is the life of your opposition. There are a variety of ways you can take out your foes, whether it be conventional or extraordinary. A quick bullet to the head can solve many a situation, but you may find yourself aching for more creative methods, such as knocking enemies unconscious or snapping their neck. But above all else, it depends on the situation.Making noise or being spotted is not a choice idea, as an alarm will be sounded and reinforcements will be called. The enemies are good at overwhelming you, so your best recourse is to stay out of sight. You have a better chance of surviving if you take the necessary precautions and—above all else—have patience. Until you get a suppressor for your main handgun, you’ll probably want to resort to the pistol loaded with tranquilizers. This puts enemies to sleep and allows you to pass unnoticed. Placing your back against a wall is a keen idea, as you can then peek around corners while remaining concealed, and fit into tight spots otherwise unreachable. Hanging off of ledges can also apply to a certain situation; just remember that you have a grip meter to keep an eye on. If an unfortunate turn of events happens to alert the guards, do yourself a favor and hide in a locker, or perhaps under a tabletop. If you’re interested in giving them a run for their money, try shooting pipes or other objects to slow their travel, or perhaps set a trap for them. These tense moments can really get the adrenaline flowing, but it’s important to remember the stealth aspect of the game, as Snake is better suited to the shadows.With all this emphasis on hiding and running away, you’d think that there wouldn’t be a lot of attention put on weapons…but you’d be wrong. The gear you amass throughout the game serves up a sizable inventory, letting you to tackle just about any situation. To aid your itchy trigger-finger are the likes of pistols, rifles, grenades and missile launchers—and several variants for that matter. Pistols are equipped with a laser sight, and are best for focusing on intricacies, which is made considerably easier with the inclusion of a first-person aiming mechanic. Rifles come in the assault and sniper variety, where one is for full-frontal battles, and the other is for picking off enemies from a large distance. Grenades come in many flavors (none of which are cherry), and can prove to be invaluable assets. Beyond the realm of weapons, you can also find performance-enhancing drugs, and the all too recognizable cardboard box. Heck, even the cigarettes Snake carries have uses other than blackening your lungs, as the smoke itself can be used to detect infrared beams; this man is clearly the MacGyver of the future!Solid Snake has more than just tricks up his sleeves, however. While he may appear to be your generic super-soldier (with his advanced sneaking suit and all), looks are incredibly deceiving. Though he’s definitely a killing machine, the thing he does more than anything is ask questions. Poor Snake was sent into his mission essentially blindfolded, and it seems that no turn of events ever unfolds as expected. As you progress with the game and learn of new plot twists, chances are Snake is learning with you—making the relationship between character and player that much more seamless. His voice itself is synonymous with the character, and—while gravely and over-acted—provides yet another layer of depth to the man of the hour. His past is something to marvel at, and by the end of the game chances are that your outlook on him will have changed significantly. The supporting characters themselves only add to the experience, as they all have their own dark history to deal with.Perhaps the most compelling acquaintances are the ones you meet on the battlefield. The members of FOXHOUND are quite the lovable cast, and provide some of the most memorable encounters in all of video gaming. What’s more is that they all seem to be linked to Snake in one way or another, not unlike an episode of Lost. They all have a specific gimmick to call their own, and more importantly, very distinct voices—which make them all the more recognizable. Sniper Wolf is an immaculate sniper with an obsession for whoever her target may be, Psycho Mantis has a knack for telekinesis and reading peoples minds, and Revolver Ocelot wields…well, a revolver; he also has a thing for torture. But perhaps the most important antagonist of all is the leader of this organization, Liquid Snake. He bears a striking resemblance to our hero, but has long blonde hair and a decidedly English accent. Throw all that in with a cyborg ninja and a giant robot and you’ve got yourself a game.Much like the stars of the show, the game itself screams individuality. It’s comforting at times to know that a story with as much weight as Metal Gear Solid’s can find the time to take a break. It’s very self-referential, and at times can become laugh-out-loud funny. Pull out your pack of cigarettes, and prepare to be lectured on the dangers smoking can cause to your health. Does Colonel Campbell seem familiar? Look no further than Rambo. Easter eggs are also in major abundance, and are just waiting to be uncovered. The re-playability is immense, as the game contains a glut of bonus material—you just have to look between the lines to discover it. Just messing around with the enemy sentries can be very amusing; a cardboard box and a bottle of ketchup is all you need for a good time.Times are good indeed, as in case you’ve forgotten—this game has been remade. For one, all of the voice-work in the game has been completely re-recorded, so everything feels fresh for veterans. In light of the additions Metal Gear Solid 2 brought to the formula, some gameplay tweaks have been made. The biggest of these enhancements would be the first-person perspective, which makes it much easier to aim your weapon at whatever you choose—be it a head or the occasional surveillance camera. All you softies will be happy to hear of the inclusion of non-lethal weapons, such as the M9 pistol and PSG1-T. And for maneuverability’s sake, moves such as climbing over obstacles and the diving somersault have been added. Yet the biggest improvement comes from the cut-scenes themselves, as they have been completely revamped. Now featuring stylish acrobatics, you better start getting used to Snake doing some incredibly huge back flips.No matter how cool Snake looks, he still can’t conceal all the missteps this restoration has taken. While the first-person view certainly provides some fun, it essentially breaks the game. This along with the M9 make the game extremely easy, as if it wasn’t enough already. This wouldn’t inherently be a problem, if the game wasn’t a direct port of its predecessor. Both enemy and weapon placement seem to be identical to the original, and the game design does little but shoehorn these new elements into something that’s not really built for it. Although most of the voice acting is substantial, it can be slightly disappointing at times. The performances on whole don’t seem as eccentric as they used to be, and this was one of the initial charms about the game. The dialogue is practically the same, line for line. Which begs the question: why were the voices redone at all? The voice actors themselves have aged, so it doesn’t make any contextual sense. On top of that, when battles get heated you’re greeted with a massive frame-rate drop—who knew slowdown could be this fun? The tip of the iceberg: The Gamecube controller is missing four buttons; basic functionality is hindered because of this. Pressing Start + A to open up the codec screen is about as intuitive as performing open heart surgery with your elbows.But hey, don’t blame it all on the Game Cube. One of the fundamental problems with Metal Gear Solid is just how dated it is. It’s amazing what used to be acceptable design philosophy a decade ago. The controls themselves are needlessly complicated, unless you find holding three buttons simultaneously while aiming and shooting intuitive. Battles with the crouching mechanic await you—as going prone by accident, crawling backwards, and spinning around in place is a common occurrence—especially during intense moments. To compliment Snake’s abstract snow-angels, are a wonderful lineup of stick figure-like animations. Climbing, running, crouching, and shooting—it all looks awful. How about those next-generation forces? If by next-generation you mean poky enemies with no peripheral vision. With the ability to see three feet in front of themselves, these genetically enhanced soldiers may need to get their prescription adjusted.In the end, Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes is essentially the same game with a fresh coat of paint. Of course, that isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as this opens up the intriguing world of Snake to an entirely new generation. What lies beyond the candy-coating is a powerfully gripping narrative, one that impeccably blends fact and fiction, crafting a unique method of storytelling. Once positioned as a phenomenally realistic experience, it’s definitely less “real” by today’s standards—yet remains unparalleled. While it certainly isn’t for everyone, you at least owe it to yourself to give it a whirl, as you might walk out an enlightened individual.- Michael Rivard',\n",

       " {'deck': 'Half Life 2',\n",
       "  'description': \"As a huge fan of the original Half Life, I was incredibly apprehensive approaching its sequel. Sure, I'd heard great things, but you hear positive consensus about a great deal of games that when you actually play, turn out to disappoint you. I was incredibly relieved to discover in my first few minutes of play, that Half Life 2 is one of those few sequels that manages to live up to the standard set by its predecessor.Half Life 2 again follows the escapades of scientist and unlikely hero; Gordon Freeman. Following his adventures at Black Mesa, a long time has passed. You are again called upon to save humanity and are plunged back into the fray by the mysterious G-man (a recurring character from the first game) to save Earth from the clutches of the evil Combine, a mysterious force that has managed to conquer the planet and enslave its population. Clearly the storyline gives the gamer a familiar scenario to overcome, but there is so much more to Half Life 2 than just that.What first hits you when you pick up and play Half Life 2 is the graphical difference between it and the original. Even now, a couple of years after its release, this game still has the power to blow you away with its breathtaking visuals. It is obvious that Half Life 2 is a work of passion, of love for gaming, as it really does go all out to deliver the best gaming experience possible. The diversity of levels is astounding, and the graphics perfectly complement this, capturing an essence of realism not unearthed to the same extent in the previous chapter, but all the while maintaining that traditional Half Life feel. From the bustling City 17, to the zombie-infested Ravenholm, to wide expanses of wasteland, the level design in this game is phenomenal, and it adds a great deal to the enjoyment that you experience. Such stellar level design makes great strides towards creating a sense of atmosphere that was so prominent in the original. A common feature of many FPS games is that they all have a similar art style throughout, and as such, many of the levels appear very similar, and get rather repetitive and mundane after a couple of hours of play. Whilst Half Life 2 does have continuity in terms of art style, each level is so vastly different to the one that preceded it; it feels like every chapter is its own game, adding greatly to the excitement factor, and keeping the gamer hooked from start to finish.In terms of gameplay, again, Half Life 2 pulls out all the stops. You of course have recurring elements of gameplay that have been carried through; bashing through openings with the crowbar, crawling through air vents, carefully manoeuvring around ledges. In many ways it is pleasing to see that they didn't deviate too much from the original game. Usually with a sequel, in an attempt to make the game look new and exciting, developers ruin the very essence of what made the games good in the first place. I was pleased to see that Valve has managed to balance the old elements with the new elements exceptionally well, as it doesn't feel like a clone of the original Half Life, but it feels like it belongs to the same family. Which is how, in a perfect world, all sequels should be. The game has a great deal of variety in terms of gameplay also, from basic shoot-em-up elements, to introducing puzzles and vehicle sequences, all of which captivate the interest of the gamer, and make sure that the experience is as exciting in the last minute as it is in the first. Simply put, Half Life 2 is a great deal of fun to play, and I was pleased to see that just as much emphasis was put upon delivering an enjoyable gaming experience, as was placed upon the need for nice, shiny graphics. Again, in this aspect, Half Life 2 appears to have got the balance just right.The great wealth of enemies available to fight was a great surprise to me. I expected what is the norm for most games; a few core enemies interspersed with extra characters every couple of levels. Half Life 2 goes above and beyond the call of duty, introducing a huge army of evil creatures, from the headcrabs and barnacles featured in the previous game, to new additions, such as the ferocious ant lions. The Combine soldiers also add a sense of familiarity, as you are fighting against soldiers, a common enemy of the genre, but one that is as adept and proficient in the use of weaponry as you are, which makes for some tense combat situations. This is aided by the fact that the AI in the game is top notch, as at some key moments you are really put up against it, and have to use a variety of tactics to come out on top.The story, I hasten to add, was somewhat of a disappointment. I touched on this notion previously, that while it carries on elements featured in the original, and features recurring characters; Half Life 2 makes little effort to fill us in on what has happened to Freeman since the debacle of the previous game. As an avid fan of the original, this annoyed me, as I expected the game to fill me in on certain questions that were raised previously. This does create a sense of mystery that works relatively well as an accompaniment to the storyline, but in reality it would have been better to see some elements of the story drawn to a conclusion, as you get the sense that Half Life 2 was merely paving the way for future sequels. The story that it does contain is hardly groundbreaking, the Combine are effectively futuristic terrorists, and in this sense Half Life 2 does little to move away from what is the basis of so many cliché FPS games. In this sense it is a shame that the developers weren't daring enough to introduce something as revolutionary as the gameplay and graphics managed, and instead opted to take the easy way out.That said, the notion of Freeman being the reluctant hero does work incredibly well, and the diversity of environments carries through what would otherwise be a pretty mundane and predictable adventure. There is little emotional development of the character of Freeman, which would have been nice to see, as it was a factor also absent from the previous game. This isn't aided by the fact that the character never speaks, or the lack of cinematic cut scenes. You would've thought that Half Life 2 would have been the perfect opportunity to flesh out his role a bit more, but this was not seized. I think that the reasoning behind this was that it was supposed to let the gamer take on the role of Freeman; we see everything from his perspective. However, in my view, instead of achieving this effect, it just made out what potentially could have been a very interesting character, into a rather bland one, devoid of all emotion. But that is nitpicking the concept of the first game just as much as this one, so it is hardly Half Life 2's fault for including this factor of continuity.Whilst the gameplay and graphics may be some of the best, and clearly show that time and effort have been put into the game, they are not as innovative as what was achieved through the original game. Half Life revolutionised the genre, in many ways it was unfair to pit the sequel up against its predecessor, but it is clear that Half Life 2 makes little effort to reciprocate this notion of trying out something new, and instead goes for the safe approach. This is a boring, but nonetheless understandable option. That said, there are new elements of Half Life 2 that do add a great deal to the enjoyment factor. Vehicles are a neat addition, and definitely help to break up the segments of blasting through hordes of Combine soldiers. The Gravity Gun also adds a whole new aspect to the game, flinging around crates and objects offers an extremely refreshing break from the non-stop action gameplay, and the game itself puts a great deal of emphasis on this weapon as an aid to help solving puzzles and defeating certain enemies. It also gives an opportunity to show off the remarkable physics engine that is in place. This addition I feel is one of the game's strongest, it really adds to the sci-fi aspect of the game and is just plain fun, an element all too lacking in games of the recent generations.However, another element through which Half Life 2 falls down is the actual difficulty of the game. This is not saying that the game is a walk in the park, by no means is that the case. Particularly on hard mode, you have to be an avid gamer, familiar with the genre, to make it through in one piece. That said, the game is incredibly inconsistent. I found myself frequently getting stuck on puzzles at early points in the game, which was made extremely frustrating by the fact that the learning curve was especially sharp. This was followed by incredibly easy parts that could simply be waltzed through with the aid of a shotgun or other powerful weapon. I think the duration of the game was sufficiently long, but Half Life 2 did not build up the difficulty throughout the experience, and I think it suffers as a result of this. The ending was pitifully easy; I don't know what happened to the frustratingly difficult bosses of old but I want them back. It felt like an achievement to finally complete the game, but it was a hollow achievement. I wanted the difficulty of the game, the time and effort that the developers put in, to culminate at the end with one terrific boss fight. Alas, this was not the case, and if you were expecting an emphatic conclusion, you will be sorely disappointed.That said, Half Life 2 is still an amazing game in so many different aspects. It is a masterpiece of the modern age, and I advocate that anybody who is even the slightest bit interested in the world of videogames would find something to enjoy in Half Life 2, whether you are a fan of the series, or just starting out. Pure gaming fun throughout; a brilliant feat of development, Half Life 2 would make an excellent addition to anyone's collection.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Mass Effect is an epic sci-fi action RPG from the folks at BioWare. You play as Commander Shepard, the first human to be inducted into the Spectres, a group of elite agents whose goal is to maintain galactic stability at any cost.  Your job is to hunt down Saren, a rogue Spectre Agent who, without giving too much away, wants to use old technology to do bad things. That\\'s the basic gist of the story. And I mean basic. It\\'s near impossible to sum up the story in a few sentences because the Mass Effect universe is just so deep.  You\\'ll constantly be learning new things about the galaxy throughout the entire game, and it seems you can\\'t go two minutes without it dumping a 5-paragraph essay into your Codex describing whatever you were just looking at or talking about in great detail. The Codex is basically an encyclopedia for Mass Effect, and it has thorough descriptions for pretty much everything, ranging from the thrusters on your ship to the reproductive processes of the races in the galaxy.  A lot of your time in Mass Effect will be spent talking to people, and this is where one of the game\\'s defining features comes into play--the conversation wheel. As characters talk to you, you get to select your reaction from a wheel of responses. It\\'s not quite as innovative as it was cooked up to be, as the general formula for most conversations seems to be, \\'select the top option for a nice, friendly response and select the bottom option to be a complete prick.\\' There are some parts of the game where your responses can affect the outcome of the story, but they\\'re usually clearly labeled so it\\'s not really much of a surprise. It\\'s a really cool feature nonetheless.  When you\\'re not talking to characters, you\\'ll usually be exploring the world or fighting, whether it\\'s on-foot or in the Mako rover. On-foot combat is really fun and the game\\'s cover system works well enough. You even have basic control over your squad with the d-pad a-la Rainbow Six: Vegas. Your squad can be a bit dumb at times though, just standing there in the open while enemies pelt them with bullets, despite the fact that there is cover just a few feet away. They also have a habit of stepping right in front of you and getting in your way while you\\'re shooting, which can be a bit of a nuisance. There were also a few bizarre happenings, like my squad not listening to my commands for part of a level, though these issues were few and far between.  While the on-foot combat is pretty good, the Mako combat could use some major improvements. The turret has limited vertical movement, so you have to be on the same level as your enemies to hit them. Problem is, the majority of the planets have constant elevation changes. It\\'s rare that you\\'ll be on the same level as your enemies without being right up in their face, making your vehicle an easy target to hit.  During one of the side quests I had to defeat a bunch of Geth Snipers, Rocket Troopers, and Shock Troopers, all surrounding two Geth Colossi. They were at the bottom of a small valley surrounded by mountains on almost all sides. If I tried to shoot at them in the Mako from the safety of the mountaintops, I couldn\\'t aim low enough to hit them, but if I went down there my Mako would be immediately pelted by gunfire and explode a few seconds later. I just could not pass this part using the darn thing, so eventually I ditched it and ran around on-foot with my shotgun instead (and it worked!). If a shotgun is, at times, more effective than a heavily armed APC, you know the APC can\\'t be that great.  The Mako combat isn\\'t helped by the fact that most of the planets you use it on are just downright boring. Pretty much every planet that isn\\'t a main quest planet is an \"uncharted world,\" meaning a barren planet that usually doesn\\'t have more than a few people living on it. The majority of side quests take place on uncharted worlds, so if you\\'re a completionist you\\'ll be spending a lot of time exploring these planets.  Navigating the worlds is fun at first, but by the time you\\'ve done a few of them you start to realize that they\\'re all the same. Every single one is just an empty, rocky environment with a different texture for the ground. Even the buildings on the planets are repetitive. You\\'ve got your square base, your circular base, your mine, and a few other structures. These buildings appear on the uncharted worlds and they look exactly the same. If you\\'ve been in one circular base, you\\'ve been in them all.  This means the side quests are very repetitive as well. The game may give you a different reason to go to each base, but in the end you\\'re just doing the same five things over and over again. Go to an uncharted world, travel to a base, kill some mercenaries, go back to your ship. The next side quest will probably have you doing the exact same thing, but this time the ground on the planet is green rather than brown, and instead of mercenaries there\\'ll be Geth inside the base. And that makes it completely different. No, really.  Mass Effect\\'s problems don\\'t stop there either. The game is also plagued by a hard-to-navigate inventory system. There is a 150 item limit, which will probably be hit about a third of the way into the game. From then on you have to get rid any item you pick up until you make room in your inventory. The inventory system has many small annoyances that make it a pain to use. You can only delete things one at a time, instead of selecting multiple things and deleting them all at once.  In addition, if you have more than one of the same item, it will be listed multiple times in your inventory instead of just once with the quantity next to it. It\\'s really annoying when you want to delete all ten of Item X and have to navigate the entire list to find all of them separately. The inventory also suffers from lack of consistency. When you delete weapons or armor, the cursor will stay in the same place on the list, but if you delete weapon or armor upgrades, the cursor will scroll back up to the top of the list. Since your worst items tend to be at the bottom of the list, this means when you\\'re deleting upgrades, you have to scroll to the bottom of the list over and over again for each item you want to delete.  The game\\'s last problem is the constant texture pop-in and slowdown. Mass Effect is one of the best looking games out for the Xbox 360, but when you\\'re talking to someone and see the background loading behind them it\\'s a bit of an immersion breaker. This is apparently a \"feature\" of Unreal Engine 3, but I own other games that use the engine and none of them have pop-in as prevalent as in Mass Effect. There are also frequent frame rate drops, though they aren\\'t bad enough to make the game unplayable, but once again, it\\'s an immersion breaker.  By this point I\\'m sure it sounds as if I hate Mass Effect, being that I\\'ve been ragging on the game for the past eight paragraphs, but that\\'s not true at all. I loved Mass Effect, but it had a lot of problems that need to be pointed out. In fact, despite all my whining, none of the issues make the game unplayable, and when the game shines, it really shines. Mass Effect has an amazing story and one of the deepest universes I have ever seen in any game, period. Having conversations with NPCs is surprisingly fun, and the combat is pretty good as well. Mass Effect has plenty of room for improvement in the sequels, but even with its problems it\\'s still an amazing game and shouldn\\'t be missed by anyone who even remotely likes story-driven RPGs.',\n",

( the brother of the charcter that helps the main charcter then turns on him in vice city orginal) He was in the miltary and his Commanding Office made him do drug runing missions ( whcih u get to play) and hide the drugs under your bunk bed. A nother officer cathes you and kicked you out of the miltary onto the streets.You go on a ruthless rampage working for southern hicks to big time drugs lords. Graphics are nice for a PSP to PS2 port.Sounds is good as always with quality voice acting and realistic car and gun sounds.Great radio stations but not so great of a soundtrack this time.The game is extremly cheap for a price of 20 bucks and comes with a cool poster and a instruction manual with funny ads to read.I think anybody who loves GTA our free froam games should pick this one up.

The game quickly pulls you in close and together you both share a special bond with each other. The fact that not only gameplay is supurb but aswell the storyline. Aside from those two the graphics are astounding with beautiful to destruction scenery. The game would not be classified as a game but instead as a memorable experience that Old Snake and you have gone through together from the start and end.My review must already be clear to you, I rate this game to the highest number there is. My reasons are mainly for the breath taking storyline. I laughed and struggled through parts of the story with Snake. Everything falls into place, no cliff hanging \"what if..\"s. I understood everything as I reached the final part in the story, even which they also integrated the Nintendo and Portable Ops storyline with this game. I am proud to say that I had cried at the end, not just for the last line of the Metal Gear Solid franchise but mainly for the storyline. I cried in front of my friend and my brother.Anyways, the new upgraded revolutionary type of concealment, OctoCamo suit which Octagon has made for Snake in his way to save the planet, is by far the greatest tool in stealth. Weapon laundering, which is introduced to you by the weapons dealer Drebin, and also \"pimping\" out your armory with a vass variety of add-ons is genious! All new additions completely go together like peas and carrots.My finale score is obvious..5/5',\n",

       "  'description': 'By now you are probably aware of the Lego phenomenon.\\xa0 Take one part great movie classic, and introduce one part fun, lovable construction toy.\\xa0 These games have taken the gaming industry by storm.\\xa0 Going from “Hey that looks like it might be interesting,” to “What will be the next Lego-ized IP?” (Batman)\\xa0 The simple fact is, like them or not, Lego games are here to stay.\\xa0 After the monumental success of the Star Wars games, Indiana Jones was the next logical step.\\xa0 Who doesn’t love the grail seeking adventure of Last Crusade, or the timeless and regularly copied boulder chase from Raiders?\\xa0 Well now you get to relive those and most of the other memorable scenes from the trilogy.\\xa0 Lego Indiana Jones: the Original Adventures takes you through all of the events from the trilogy in that same kooky and silent formula that made the other games so fun. (I suppose it might be worth mentioning that the new movie is not included in this game) \\xa0 This title sees Indy through his original adventures in all their glory, sans a few key scenes to maintain their ESRB rating to be sure.\\xa0 Those hoping for the classic face melting and heart ripping will be sadly left wanting.\\xa0 Other then that however, the game does a great job letting you relive the classic trilogy.\\xa0 The level environments are wonderfully done and the addition of the complete original music makes you really feel like part of the action.\\xa0 They add a particularly nice touch for the level loading screen which shows you the traversed path between level locations on a map just like in the movies.\\xa0 Indy and the cast have impressively well detailed movement animations that really go a long way in a silent game.\\xa0 They even go as far as to showcase a new character phobia mechanic where certain characters have these fears of certain things, like Indy and snakes.\\xa0 These fears force you to find other avenues to help get frightened characters across perilous paths.\\xa0 This adds a new layer of dynamic realism that helps get that complete movie adaptation across.\\xa0 A throwing mechanic has also been added, since we can’t all have force push powers.\\xa0 This mechanic is pretty spot on and includes an auto targeting feature so you can easily hurl a sword through a rope to gain access to a special area.\\xa0  \\xa0 Much like Star Wars, this title features different class types where certain characters possess certain abilities.\\xa0 This time around, the classes are much more robust.\\xa0 Abilities include an explosives expert who is essential in destroying certain types of Lego blocks to gain access to otherwise inaccessible areas, a glyph reader who can use his blue book to decipher secret messages on the walls, female characters who can jump higher then any other character and some are even able to break glass with their screams of peril, and of course Indy himself whose specialties with a whip allow you to manipulate certain environments.\\xa0 The shorter characters return as well to help you through the game along with run of the mill gunmen.\\xa0 Helping you to identify when special characters are needed, the game provides a small glowing patch of ground to indicate there is an interactive aspect near.\\xa0 This is also especially useful when using ropes.\\xa0 The ropes and vines produce a small circle of light to help you determine exactly where in the environment they are.\\xa0 Though this feature doesn’t make up for the terrible camera, (this is the next generation here and every game should have a player controlled camera environment!) it does help a little with prospective problems. \\xa0 A fixed camera is not the only problem that plagues this recent trip down the Lego aisle.\\xa0 Fans of the genre will note that the game still lacks in the playing time department.\\xa0 Sure there are a few (Three) bonus levels out there but that only brings the total up to 21, a far cry away from the standards these days.\\xa0 You are also going to miss that lightsaber in combat situations.\\xa0 Indy sports a newly revamped fighting system and though it is nice to look at, comes across more cumbersome then anything else.\\xa0 This is mainly due to everyone else having a gun and you left with a whip.\\xa0 Sure it is cool to fling your whip around, but let me tell you, your whip isn’t going to scare those bullets flying towards you!\\xa0 The frustration of this system becomes overwhelmingly clear when you continually find yourself being shot by someone off screen.\\xa0 And don’t look to your AI controlled counterpart for help, the only thing he or she will be good for is stunning a foe momentarily.\\xa0 The baddies always go for player one first, as apposed to the most prominent threat.\\xa0 This is due to poor AI programming or an attempt at throwing all the action at the player, you decide.\\xa0 If you are fighting with one of three guys, the other one or two will work on your counterpart (it is sort of like a dance seeing as neither one ever gets killed) then immediately following the demise of the foe you were working on, the others steer their attention away from your buddy and set sights on you.\\xa0 You have to wonder why the developer chose this almost infantile form of combat tactics.\\xa0 That doesn’t equal out to an enjoyable experience.\\xa0 Throw in a few annoying puzzles, not all of them mind you just a few, and you will have an idea of what aspects this game falls short in. \\xa0 If you thoroughly enjoyed the other branches in the Lego family tree, this one is sure to add an afternoon of excitement in your family home.\\xa0 It is nice to see how they can shake up their formula to incorporate different styles of gameplay specifically for different movie adaptations.\\xa0 Even though some aspects are bad, overall the game is still improving on the original foundations.\\xa0 Taking the limitations aside and looking past the obvious “milking the cash cow” routine, this game really is fun and the only thing that truly hurts it is that it is so dang short.\\xa0 One long afternoon is all you need to see everything it has to offer.\\xa0 Luckily they throw in a few bonus levels and characters, stretching it out to two afternoons.\\xa0 Maybe.\\xa0 Regardless, true fans of the growing phenomenon that is lego-ized IPs will no doubt be completely satisfied with this new addition and at a discounted price, it defiantly isn’t the worst game you could buy.6 out of 10 > \"Fun\"\\xa0 (I use a 10 point sytem but Giant Bomb uses a 5 Star system so I suppose this equals out to a 3)',\n",

       "  'description': \" Talk to any gamer old enough to have owned a NES, and they will invariably tell you about how much they loved Kid Icarus. The game is regarded as a classic, and rarely a day passes without someone on the forums clamoring for a sequel. Now that the game is available for the Wii's virtual console, it's tough not to wonder why the game is held in such high regard.  Kid Icarus is best described as a mix between a side-scrolling shooter and a platformer, incorporating elements of both. The angel Pit, your character, will have to jump from ledge to ledge and use his magic bow to fight off enemies from Hell itself. While the premise isn't all that original, it's decent, and nothing to hold against the game.  The rest of Kid Icarus is a completely different story. A sadistic difficulty level, infinitely spawning enemies, and low health are the most blatant offenders, although far from the only culprits. As Pit ascends from platform to platform he must fight off his enemies with his bow. here is where the problems begin: missing a platform and falling to the bottom of the screen means instant death. It's impossible to backtrack and pick up an item or enter a door you may have missed, and enemies will spawn infinitely until you advance past their spawn point.  Fighting off enemies is a simple matter of shooting them with your bow, but even that is tougher than it sounds. Pit's arrows don't travel very far, meaning to kill an enemy you must be practically touching it, which, for obvious reasons, doesn't end well most of the time. When killed, enemies leave behind hearts which can be used to purchase upgrades and items in the game's rare shops. Some of these upgrades (Such as additional health) serve to make the game easier, but they are so difficult to obtain, it's a moot point. The rest of the game is as afflicted as the basic gameplay. Small, bland, barely animated sprites that weren't all that impressive even back during the time of the NES comprise the graphics, which hold up horribly. A single-color background and some platforms to jump between is all the scenery you'll be taking in on your journey, and the chirping, repetitive music that accompanies the bland sprites certainly doesn't help.  Overall, Kid Icarus is a sadistically difficult game, that doesn't deserve it's reputation as a classic. Underwhelming graphics, even at the time of it's release, poor sound, and bad gameplay combine to form Kid Icarus. As if adding insult to injury, Nintendo has removed several of the cheat codes from the original game, and hasn't even bothered to remove the slowdown that occurs when multiple enemies crowd the screen. Kid Icarus was a mediocre game when it released in 1987, and it's no better now, 20 years later. \",\n",

       "  'description': ' Coded Arms got a lot of hype as the first First Person Shooter to be released for Sony\\'s PlayStation Portable handheld. The game was regarded with some uncertainty, as gamers were uncertain that the PSP could pull off a shooter without a second analog stick. As has been proven with more recent games, it certainly can; however Coded Arms is simply not a shining example of what the PSP platform can do.  The game does not allow for the controls to be re-vamped to custom settings, but it does however provide several control schemes for you to choose from. The default setting has you moving with the analog stick, and aiming with the face buttons. This setup is trash, allowing for little control or precision. The best option available is to move with the face buttons, and aim with the analog stick. It works decently, but then we run into the games next problem: it is very, very imprecise. Those who don\\'t believe FPS can be done properly on consoles would be having fits over Coded Arms. The game features sticky aim, akin to a rather weak lock-on, but even with that, it\\'s maddening to attempt to wrestle your reticule over your enemy, only to have them move again, and begin the whole dance all over. The control is not broken, but totally imprecise. You\\'ll get wasted by little flying bugs, who should be dispatched in seconds, because you simply cant target them. The PSP\\'s aggravating sliding analog stick simply compounds your problems.  This might be bearable, if you were traversing exotic locales and urban jungles, at least able to take in the scenery. Instead, Coded Arms insists on using randomly generated environments, so \"Every playthrough is unique.\" Honestly though, they should have made sure this game was worth playing twice, before they started worrying about it getting repetitive. And repetitive it is. The environments might be random, but they all share the same characteristics. Metal room with moss covered walls. Okay. Onwards to a... metal room with moss covered walls. The games graphics do an adequate job, but there really isn\\'t much impressive in Coded Arms. You\\'ll see some massive bosses, and some large enemies, but the imagery doesn\\'t really rise above average.  Coded Arms features some nice sounds for weapons, and some ambient sounds, but it\\'s music is really nothing to comment on. You\\'ll find yourself forgetting the tunes seconds after they\\'re played. Probably the most impressive sound you\\'ll hear in Coded Arms is the sound your metal boots make against the floor as you walk through a silent corridor.  However dull Coded Arms is, it still has some value, ironically due to the randomly generating maps which make the rest of it so bland. The game doesn\\'t bother with a story, besides a small paragraph or two in the manual, but you can play forever, not see the same room twice. Why you\\'d want to is another matter, but if you\\'re one of those people who likes to compulsively play bad games, the option is there.  Coded Arms is a bad game. There\\'s no way around it. It\\'s dull, it\\'s unimaginative, it\\'s horribly frustrating, and it never realizes the full potential of the PSP system. The game simply isn\\'t much fun. The controls are not crippling, but they denote the quality of the rest of the game, which is, to say the least, dismal. Coded Arms is bland, and aggravating, and does neither the genre, nor the platform, justice.  ',\n",

The game does feel tailored for consoles and doesn't feel like a bad port, but they did remove some key diplomatic features of the game like forming alliances and non-agression pacts, etc. and pretty much streamlined the gameplay to allow for quicker and hassle-free matches. You can no longer directly control workers, however you can still dictate the production of a particular city's resources, so you can opt for gold instead of production or leave it balanced at default, etc.Much of the core gameplay was left intact. You still have your tech trees that you need to progress through and building cities still rely on picking out a good location. The maps are always randomly generated which helps to keep things fresh through each playthrough but you can't pick the diverse settings of how the world will be shaped as like in the PC version. After a handful of matches, you'll start to notice that the world is generally broken into small-sized continents which can sometimes be too small for two or more civilizations to grow properly without fighting.The A.I. can be a tough opponent but after awhile you'll start to notice that most, if not all, are overly aggressive. Things might be peaceful for the first part of the game and then out of nowhere a civilization will demand almost all of your gold or a certain tech in exchange for x number of turns of peace. It's like having a peace treaty but before the war, so it doesn't really make sense and knowing how many turns you have left of peaceful conditions kinda ruins any peaceful intentions without feeling like being pushed around. Anyway, this type of gameplay was fun at first but it got annoying later on since all I was doing was defending / attacking other nations about 1/3 into the game.The multiplayer experience can be more of a challenge, like most games, and is built really well. The built-in VOIP lets you smack-talk, negotiate, smack-talk, plead for peace, smack-talk, talk behind someone's back, etc. which is a cool feature to have for a Civ game. The matches can be fairly long however, but if a player leaves the AI will just take over until the game is finished.Graphics are from the Civ IV engine but they still look good on the big screen. Sound and music are nothing to brag about but they serve their purpose. Animations are done fairly well and the engagements are always fun to watch thanks to the updated fight animations where each unit will scatter across the tile as they fight the enemy.Overall - This game is a nice breath of fresh air in the console market but if you're looking for a more complete, polished, and deeper version of the game do yourself a favor and pickup the PC version already.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'For anyone who has lost faith in the straight single player game in a world of online multiplayer madness, Assassin\\'s Creed is that glimmer of hope you may be searching for. Finally there is a highly satisfying, and richly developed game that has been designed from the ground up to be a solo adventure like non other. This game shows you what a \"current gen\" one-player game can be and raises the bar for what is possible. You will find yourself with many moments of sheer excitement as you play through the twisting storyline that Assassin\\'s Creed lays before you. Though it is not a perfect game, what little flaws it possesses are few and far between and don\\'t really affect the overall enjoyment of this tale.In Assassin\\'s Creed, you first find yourself playing the role of Desmond, a normal run of the mill bartender, who has been abducted by some highly industrialized tech company. You find out that they don\\'t really want Desmond they just want his genetic memories, the memories of Altaïr. This is how the game works. You spend some time in a side story as Desmond, before being thrown into the real game to play as Altaïr, the main character. This works by Desmond in essence reliving a genetic memory of Altaïr through the means of an Animus, a machine which links to Desmond\\'s brain and allows him to relive his ancestor\\'s memories. With all that explanation aside, this two-sided story approach is really an interesting way of organizing the games seven chapters. In the beginning you really don\\'t understand at all what is going on in the \"futuristic\" storyline, but that is intentional. As you progress you find out more and more, piecing together the puzzle of this side story. That leads us to the first big flaw in the game, the ending. I suppose it\\'s not really a flaw, more bad taste in design. Anyone who is familiar with the ending to Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back would have a good idea of the way this story ends. Basically it leads up to some big event that never happens. Since the story starts and ends in this side story that leaves it as a bit of a let down. However the main story of the game does have an ending, which is satisfying if not entirely predictable.On a gameplay standpoint this game delivers an intense experience. The mix of stealth and action really does go far beyond what Kojima first invented in MGS. To augment the sneaking around, you have four ways to deal with those pesky guards: secret blade, sword, fists, and the short sword/throwing knife combo. You will find a use of all of these as your skills advance. The secret blade is just amazingly satisfying to use and you won\\'t easily tire of it. The game provides a nice cinematic camera touch in key moments when using this blade or performing an equally nice counter kill during a sword fight. Sword fights are not particularly impressive but they do add a different dynamic when faced with no other option and flow fairly smoothly. There are in fact moments when you must face off against a group of guards who enjoy surrounding you and wait for you to attempt to attack one, leaving you vulnerable for a slash across your backside. This can be frustrating for those who enjoy hack and slash sword fighting because timing is everything. If you are off with your timing you are going to get mowed down. This is an example of emphasizing details. The game plays a convincing role in realism details, such as the games use of maps. Basically you have to put together a map of an area from scratch. To do this you must climb to the top of the highest buildings in the city and surveying the surrounding area. That area is then added to a map. There are usually around 10 per area. You might think this to become tedious, and it would, if it wasn\\'t so much fun to do. It truly is just fun to watch Altaïr scale this huge building, perch onto a ledge and take in the sights, before taking a \"leap\" into a conveniently placed pile of hay. That hay plays an important role in the game. The main idea here is stealth, get to know the area, gather information on the target, and assassinate all without being detected by the numerous city guards. There are three different states of awareness: the regular state which is basically no guards around, the yellow state where there is a guard around, and the red state when the guards are watching you. The first two states you really don\\'t have to be that careful, it\\'s the last one that will make them wise to what you are. If you do manage to alert them to your presence, and this is increasingly easy to do as you progress through the story, you only have two options: rely on your sword to take down anywhere from one to a dozen if not more guards that are pursuing you until you are no longer suspected, or the games more supported tactic, run. You must run taking turns at high speeds trying to elude your pursuers. Once they cannot see you, you are then tasked with finding a good hiding place until they give up. You will find that sitting on a bench, blending in with scholars or hiding in a pile of hay can prove most useful in eluding your captors. If no pile of hay is available, take to the roofs and hide in one of the convenient covered gardens. In fact the best way to get away from the heat is the rooftops. All in all the whole system of blending in and sneaking around is highly enjoyable and leaves you feeling quite superior. Satisfaction is delivered on all fronts of this amazing title. Side notes to mention are the fact that though it is great to have in engine cut scenes, you also need a way to skip through them. They become annoying at best on a second play through of any particular chapter. Speaking of a second play through, there really isn\\'t much of a need for it. There isn\\'t much replay value unless you are just itching to find every single last flag in the game. The fact that you have to play the entire chapter over again and cannot just pick up in one spot doesn\\'t help. You might as well just play the whole thing again from start to finish. The whole game won\\'t take you an incredible amount of time to get through but it is a game worth playing if not owning just for its sheer mastery. Through the ingenious gameplay and attention to detail, UbiSoft has delivered to us an experience like non other. The drawbacks aside this is a game worth every penny and it gets a 9 out of 10 only because of the problems it has with the PS3 engine. A 9 out of 10 is \"Above and Beyond\" in my rating system and that is exactly what this game goes.(I use a 10 point scale so with Giant Bomb\\'s 5 point system it equals out to a 4.5)',\n",

I recently picked this up because a friend recommended it and it was a fantastic recommendation. For a mere $20 I got both Starcraft and the expansion plus both guide books. The online play is fun and addictive with amazing longevity due to it being free, easy to use and includes a very good map editor/maker (which the community has really got into). Most of the games i enjoyed online are not even the normal game modes. To be honest I haven’t actually gone into the single player for there is so much more in the online play! The obvious flaw I find is just a couple of annoyances such as the “selecting 12 max units rule” and some other minor problems. These will all be fixed in the next installment. For me, they don't even need to change that much to create another piece of perfection.   Well worth purchasing and remember this is based only on online play so there probably is a bundle of more fun in the campaign!\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Although Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots introduces a variety of new ways to kill your enemies, at heart, it’s still the same game it’s always been. The gameplay has been tightened up and vastly improved, but underneath that, all that gamers have come to expect from the Metal Gear Solid series remains. Convoluted plot lines, unbelievable twists, out of this world characters and nanomachines are all still present in MGS4. Despite being fundamentally the same as its predecessors, MGS4 gets my vote for being the best in the series.   As pretty much everybody knows by this stage, MGS4 will be the last Metal Gear game to feature Solid Snake. For most other game characters, this may not necessarily be that big a deal, but for Solid Snake it is. To many gamers, even those who have never touched a Metal Gear game, he has become something like a legend – a feat he has achieved independent of each Metal Gear’s previous instalments’ insistence that he is a legend of the battlefield. Speaking of which, you will be glad to know that by the end of MGS4, you will have found out whether love can bloom on the battlefield. Anyway, Snake is pretty much already a legend in gaming. This comes from being the lead character of a highly acclaimed series which, at this stage, has spanned a good twenty years. In that context, it is quite saddening that MGS4 will be the final chapter in his life within gaming. Luckily, Hideo Kojima has provided Snake with a fitting end to his career which makes MGS4 close to being perfect, at least for fans of the series.  Unlike nearly every game out there, the strength of MGS4 is not the game per se. Instead, one gets the feeling that the majority of the emphasis is placed on the story. Although, by this stage in the series, that should be expected. Also as in previous Metal Gear games, the plot is as convoluted as ever, with more twists in it than the wiring shoved behind your TV stand. The script, at times, is poor. In fact it can get so over the top and melodramatic, that even the biggest Metal Gear fan will probably wish they had employed at least one decent editor. That said, most of the time, the unnecessarily dramatic script fits the unnecessarily dramatic story and cut scenes, so maybe there was no editor for a reason. Nearly every character who means anything in the MGS universe makes an appearance in MGS4, except those who are dead. Actually, even some of them have been thrown into the mix somewhere.   If you hadn’t already noticed, much of what drives the story, and the manner in which it is driven, hasn’t changed in MGS4 compared to any of the older games. Perhaps the biggest change is that the codec conversations have been scaled back considerably. Gone are the boring codec conversations that last forever, serving to tell the player of a secret society of some sort. Instead, much more of the story is told via cut scenes. For a game with such high production values and a unique cinematic feel, thus undoubtedly works to the games favour.  As already mentioned, a number of the series’ better known characters reappear in MGS4. Obviously those include Solid Snake, Otacon, the Colonel and Ocelot, but there are also others who are still alive and need to have their stories concluded. Characters such as Meryl, Raiden and Vamp fall into this category. There are a number of others, but to say who might be to give away some of the more interesting plot twists of the game. Perhaps the biggest surprise in terms of the characters is that Raiden is actually a pretty cool character this time round. Gone are his feminine looks and tight fitting ‘sneaking suit.’ Instead, he sports a distinctly ‘ninja’ looking outfit, complete with sword and a futuristic looking helmet thing. Other characters don’t feel like they fit in quite as well as Raiden, unfortunately. As mentioned, pretty much all characters still alive appear and this makes for some fairly odd moments where, even by Metal Gear standards, it just feels like they shouldn’t be there. They just don’t fit in with the context of when they’re introduced into MGS4. Ultimately, it’s hard to shake the feeling that Kojima chose to put them in just to keep fans happy. I’m trying to talk around specifics here so as not to spoil the game, but once you play these parts of the game, what I’m getting at should become a little bit clearer [hopefully].  So the story is still as prominent as ever? Yes. But if this isn’t your cup of tea, don’t despair just yet, as the gameplay in MGS4 is easily the best in any Metal Gear game to date. One of my biggest criticisms of the past games, especially Snake Eater, was the camera. Its fixed position made it unnecessarily difficult to see your surroundings. Sure, Naked Snake was missing an eye but I’m pretty sure that doesn’t stop you from, say, looking in more than one direction. Luckily, this has been remedied in MGS4. The camera, like most conventional third person shooters, can be controlled with the right analogue stick. The camouflage is also much better than on previous games. Yes, I’m looking at you MGS3. Whereas before, crawling from one shade of grey to another required a laborious trek through multi-layered menus just to change your face paint, Kojima has thankfully implemented a more adaptable camouflage system in MGS4, whereby the ‘Octocamo’ suit automatically adapts to your surroundings.  As for the actual gameplay of killing people, there is not as much tactical espionage in MGS4. It’s actually quite easy to run n gun your way through, although you can maintain stealth if preferred. In the first two locations, different factions will be fighting each other. This adds an interesting gameplay dynamic because you now must evade two sets of guards or at least ally yourself with one of them. This is undoubtedly MGS4’s best new feature, and if the story hasn’t drawn you into the series thus far, this might. Or it might not since it suddenly disappears about half way though the game never to return. At this point, the game becomes very story driven. In other words, the new promise that MGS4 exhibits towards the beginning, is extinguished by the time you reach the half way mark.  To start with, this is a shame. The first level without two factions is easily the worst in the game. Firstly, you do hardly any playing in this area, and when you do play, it isn’t exactly riveting stuff. If you hadn’t guessed, this is where non-MGS fans will lose interest and realise why they don’t like MGS. On the other hand, MGS fans will be happy for a return to normalcy, having enjoyed the variety in the first half of the game. Despite the lack of actual playing in the second half, fans will probably enjoy this part more, due largely to the locations and characters.  Based on this, I think it’s a fair judgement to say that MGS4 is for fans of MGS. If you’re not, don’t bother. The gameplay is sufficiently unique to be fun for the first 8 hours of play, but thereafter you may as well go watch a conspiracy theory movie, complete with UFO’s and New World Orders. This leads me to a dilemma. How do you score a game which one group of people will despise, whilst another group will adore it? I’ll let you come to your own conclusion on that one, but in answer to my own semi-rhetorical question, my solution is to give two scores.  Presentation: 10/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Story: 9.5/10 Longevity: 9/10  Overall (for fans): 10/10 Overall (for non-fans): 8/10   Oh and there’s also this thing called Metal Gear Online which isn’t that good. Every aspect of it feels like it came from the local discount store – it gets the job done, and that’s about it. If MGO were to be summed up in one word, it would be ‘mediocre.’ Honestly, there are better online games out there. I also got turned off straight away by the signing in process, which require registration on Konami’s website and obtaining TWO login ID’s between which you’ll get confused in about 120 seconds. That MGO is little more than a money grabbing exercise by Konami is pretty obvious too. You can’t have more than one account per PS3 without paying. You can’t even change you one characters facial features without being charged. Altogether, not very good. MGO: 6.5/10',\n",

       "  'description': \"Grand Theft Auto IV is not radically different to its last generation predecessors. It only introduces a handful of new features, many of which are fairly minor. You still commit thefts, assaults and murders in return for money. You still have to work for untrustworthy criminals who might stab you in the back at any time. You're still in . But GTA IV is better than its predecessors. It may be built on the same concept, but this time round, all of the small nuts and bolts that put GTA together are of much better quality, and fit much more closely together.  The game begins as you, Niko Bellic, step off a boat at the  docks as an illegal immigrant in search of fortune, women and fast cars. All of this has been promised by Niko's cousin, Roman, who you meet almost immediately. However, it quickly transpires that Roman has been living in a dream world and has been falsely promoting . In reality, far from living a life of luxury, Roman has been living in a small, untidy one bedroom apartment and runs a small taxi service which apparently struggles to turn over any substantial amount of money. Unimpressed with his cousin's lies, and with little choice, Niko is thrust into the criminal underworld which is prosperous in  – hardly surprising if you know anything about the GTA series.  It is difficult to pinpoint one feature of GTAIV which is better, or more compelling than any other. If one were forced to choose, the characters, the story or the city would be equally valid choices. However, perhaps the biggest improvement over previous GTA games is in the characters. Whereas in previous GTA instalments, characters could, at times, be a little too eccentric and thus unbelievable, this time round, they are, in most cases, nearly spot on. Every character is well developed in a way not usually seen in video games. By the time you have completed a few missions for each character, you should have a good understanding of what that character believes in, why they are who they are and what sets them apart from the other characters. The range of characters is also hugely diverse, from the jacked up, steroid fuelled Brucie to the marijuana smoking Jamaican, Little Jacob, to the gambling addict, Roman. What's more, each of the main characters are often more closely related in GTA IV than in previous games, something which proves interesting in latter stages of the story. Depending on how much you are drawn to big name actors, you may be disappointed to learn that there are no famous voice actors in GTA IV – no Samuel L. Jackson this time around.  With so many characters to do missions for, hang out with, and chat with, it is not easy to keep up to date on all of their situations. Luckily, this task is made a little easier via the new additions of both a cell phone and internet cafes. Your cell phone is accessible at any time (yes, even when driving) and can be used to call associates, ask for help, enquire about jobs for extra money and to invite friends out. The internet is also used to communicate with friends – although you cannot send them messages, you must wait until they send you one and then hit reply. As well as creating the ability to send emails, the internet is another medium for supplying players with a healthy dose of jokes and funny websites.  Equally as impressive as the characters which have been created, is  itself. Or rather,   and .   is based heavily on real life , whilst Alderney is based upon real life . GTA III was also set in  , but on this excursion,  is almost unrecognisable and has been greatly transformed to the point where it pretty much resembles NYC as closely as possible without actually being NYC. As well as Alderney,   features four distinct districts; Broker (Brooklyn), Dukes (Queens), Bohan (The Bronx) and Algonquin (). These districts have there own unique feel to them, so if you make the transition from one to another, it is quite obvious. This is especially true if you a flying overhead in a helicopter. Also within each district are a number of landmarks. For example, Algonquin features the Statue of Happiness (sorry, no prizes for guessing which real life landmark it is based on), and the  connects Broker to Algonquin. GTA IV's  is not as large as San Andreas, so don't go out expecting to get a bigger world just because the game is more recent. That, said, there are no 'empty' areas in . Unlike the vast deserts in San Andreas,  is a crowded, busy city which is densely populated with people, buildings and roads.  Small details in  make it feel like a real city. Pedestrians will go about their daily business, provided you don't give them a reason to either attack you or speed away in fear. Food stands are dotted around the city – an ideal place to restore your health. The subway is more complex too, to the extent it actually requires a real map of the subway system in the GTA IV box. Police Officers can sometimes be seen making arresting other people and occasionally there are traffic accidents, including the running over of unfortunate pedestrians – all these occurrences happen independently of anything you as the player do, again adding to a sense of realism. As a result of this added realism, it seems like a much bigger thing to have to kill people. You no longer necessarily feel you are just shooting a bunch of pixels on a screen. The people you kill may not be real, but they are real enough within the game for you to care about them. Similarly, sometimes you feel genuinely sorry if you accidentally run somebody over, killing them. Thankfully, if you do do this, at least you get more realistic animations thanks to the RAGE engine. This allows people, Niko included, to act differently in every collision, based on how fast you get hit, at what angle, the size of the car etc. It even allows for drivers to be thrown through the windscreens of vehicles in particular heavy collisions.  As mentioned,  has quite a bit going on. So to get from one place to another, you're going to need some transport. One of the first things you will notice when you play GTA IV is how different the cars feel from previous GTA's. Sure, each car has always been different in terms of design and their performance properties, but in GTA IV the difference is much more noticeable. The feel of the cars weight is much more noticeable. This makes braking take longer, and also means that if you do like power sliding around corners, expect the slide to last a lot longer. At first this will probably mean you crash a lot, and the new driving model is a bit more difficult than before, but once you get used to it you begin to appreciate it, even if it is harder to master. As always, you can also catch public transport. As well as the aforementioned subway, GTA IV introduced taxis. Of course, taxis were always there, but now you can pay to ride in them. This is very simple. After hailing an empty taxi, you press a button to get in, tell the driver where to go, and they take you there (duh!). You can pay more money to skip the journey, which makes getting from one corner of the city to the other a much faster experience than before. If you do need to drive such distances on your own, this is made much easier in GTA IV via the use of GPS. Basically, you plot where you want to go on the map, and the GPS shows you the quickest (legal) route to get to your destination.  An area of past GTA IV games which has often let the series down is the combat. The auto aim in particular felt a bit broken and there was never really a way to shield yourself from bullets whilst aiming and shooting back at the same time. Luckily, this has been addressed in GTA IV. You can now employ the use of a cover system during intense shootouts with 'peacekeeping officers.' It's quite simply – press R1 to take cover, L2 to auto aim, R2 to shoot. The auto aim also allows for a degree of manual aiming, so headshot are quite easy (a little too easy, actually). Additionally, the hand to hand combat is improved, and you can now kick, punch and counter enemies' attacks. You can even disarm an enemy if they are wielding a knife. Unfortunately, the auto aiming system still isn't perfect. Especially in close quarters, it can be difficult to lock on or see who you are aiming at. For example, if a cop gets the jump on you at close range, it can be difficult to lock on and shoot them due to them being within such close proximity to you. Also, throwing grenades can be a little hit and miss. On a number of occasions, you may find yourself aiming a grenade in a particular direction, only for Niko to throw it into a wall next to yourself. These issues aside, the cover system still works well 90% of the time, and is certainly an improvement over how it previously was.  As usual, there a tonne of side missions and secrets to find in the game in order to reach 100% completion. However, most players will be more concerned with the story – and it doesn't disappoint. The story is more believable in GTA IV than you may have come to expect from the series. There is no breaking into Area 51, no flying jetpacks and no jumping out of planes. However, this is not all bad. The added realism suits GTA IV and complements it's more realistic setting. The story is pretty engaging, and tends to feel more like a film. This is probably due to the better character development in GTA IV than what you are used to seeing in GTA games. Cut scenes really convey more about characters now, and being able to go out and do activities with characters allows you to learn more about them. Unlike a film though, GTA IV is more thought provoking. This is largely as a result of a new addition to the series – the ability to make choices throughout the story. Whilst most missions will still tell you exactly what to do, a few of them allow you to make decisions, such as whether or not to kill somebody. These decisions grow in importance throughout, and you will be left with some genuinely difficult decisions to make. Most of these decisions to not drastically alter the way the story goes, although they do allow for two possible endings for the story. However, personally I found both endings a bit of a let down compared to the quality narrative of the story up until then. I found it a little predictable and also a bit clichéd. With the rest of the story being so good, I was a bit disappointed with the ending. The story is also quite lengthy though. If you just focus on the main story, most players would finish it in about 25-35 hours. If you take your time and explore other areas of the game whilst doing the story, though, you can easily get 50-60 hours out of the game.  GTA IV is also the first in the series to offer online multiplayer for up to 16 other wanna be criminals. It works well enough, with a range of modes which include the standard deathmatch, cops n crooks and some interesting yet repetitive co-op missions only available online. It is also novel to be able to use the whole of  to wreak havoc on one another via the use of various weapons and vehicles (or, using vehicles as weapons). Ultimately though, the online aspect isn't great, and can best be described as an added bonus to the single player experience – I would not recommend GTA IV on its multiplayer alone. I found it difficult to join any type of game, typically getting disconnected immediately and being kicked back into single player. When I did join a game, it was quite enjoyable, but the game did suffer from frequent bouts of lag, especially when players started getting hit by cars at high speeds which were being driven by other players. This happens a lot, too, as most players immediate instinct is to jack a car and drive around in it.  A major complaint I have with GTA IV is that it is too easy. I guess this is to cater for the huge market which GTA IV appeals to as casual gamers will make up a larger percentage of sales than hardcore gamers. Nonetheless, it is too easy. There were only about half a dozen missions which I did not complete first time round. Of these 6, the reason for failure was often because I made a silly mistake, such as shooting a friendly character and having to restart – not because the enemies were too tough and killed me. I also managed to go through the entire story without getting 6 stars. This was a feat I was not even trying to achieve, it just turned out that way because the game is so easy. In fact, even in the later missions, it is rare that getting more than 3 stars would be scripted as part of the mission.  Another issue I've had with the GTA series which has not been rectified in GTA IV, is the issue of money. You get awarded tonnes of money fro doing missions, yet there is nothing to spend it on. Granted, weapons cost more this time round, but you are still awarded with more money than you can do anything with. For me, it would be better if you were paid less – that way it would not be easy for you to just go out and buy the biggest rocket launcher in the game. You might further consider if it was not worth the risk of killing a cop or stealing a cop car to acquire a handgun or shotgun.  Ultimately, despite it's flaws, GTA is a great game. It is difficult to fault it on any given aspect of its gameplay. The characters are spot on and display many more human properties than past characters have done. Niko is, in my opinion, the best lead character for a GTA game to date.  really does feel alive, with any number of possibilities available to happen during a days play. The story is engaging in a way not usually seen in video games, even if the ending does not live up to the rest of the story. On top of the single player package, you also get a decent multiplayer component thrown in for your money as well. Given all this, it is difficult to make any recommendation other than to get this game ASAP if you have a system to play it on.   Graphics: 9/10 Some textures look a little bland upon close inspection, and there are at times a few graphical glitches, but overall, all of the visuals come together nicely, resulting in a game that looks ace. You really wouldn’t notice much wrong with the graphics, unless you were looking for it.  Gameplay: 10/10 Driving is fun, shooting actually works in a first for the series. The targeting system works a dream. There’s never a shortage of things to do, and they’re all enjoyable.  Sound: 9/10 The guns and cars all sound distinct in their own ways. The music on the radio is varied, but arguably not as ear catching as previous GTA soundtracks. Talk radio is as funny as ever. Voice acting is top notch. Lifespan: 10/10 The story can easily be replayed with as much fun as the first time, due to your ability to make decisions in the story and multiple endings etc. Plus, the game is too good to only be played once. Oh, and all the stunt jumps, side missions, pigeons to shoot…  Story: 9/10 Best story yet in GTA. It really feels like an interactive movie in many ways, helped largely by memorable characters. Ending lacked the twist I was expecting and looking forward to though.  Overall: 9.2/10\",\n",

       "  'description': 'If you haven\\'t heard of this phenomenal game by now surely you must have been living under a rock. With high marks across the board, this is the evolution of music rhythm games. This defines the very genre itself and pushes the bounds of what was once thought of as far as one could go. Taking the stale, been-there-done-that feeling of other competitors attempt at music rhythm games and completely blowing them apart, Rock Band is the definitive rock star experience. This title not only puts you in the role of an up and coming rocker, it puts you there with an entire band! Packed with songs, features, and functionality, this may not be a game for every single person, but it is a must play by all.Sure one could argue that the game is not graphically glamorous, at least not when you compare it to the clarity of the competition, but looks aren\\'t everything. Harmonix has pulled out all the stops to bring the most authentic looking \"live concert\" look. Complete with stage dives and crowd join-ins, even special camera attention by the band members, you really feel like you are watching a movie of a concert. The game presents in a more loose feeling as to emphasize the rock experience as apposed to every member mainly just standing still in the same place the entire time. This is especially noticeable in the singer who jumps around on stage and just has a good ol\\' time. With all the members really showing their enthusiasm in the current song, it is easy to see how this game surpasses what has been the norm for the past years. The variety of characters doesn\\'t hurt either. Instead of having to look at the same three-and-a-half members the entire time, you get a mixture of different people from the games customized character system. It may not be as detailed as you would want, but it is nice to be able to choose what your character looks like, however limited it may be.The music of Rock Band is another step up. With the way the game works, no longer must you have guitar solo-centric songs. Instead, Rock Band is free to find songs that not only challenge the guitar players, but the drum players and the vocalists as well. Heck I am sure there is even a challenging bass line in there once or twice. The 45 songs that make up the core set list feature a nice blend of genres and eras stretching from the early days of rock right up to the present. Though some songs may only appeal to a niche group, they are all fun to play. Even if you aren\\'t particularly eager to play a certain song, you might find that playing it on drums instead of guitar makes it a lot more bearable and perhaps even fun. There are another 13 bonus songs that are offered for you to play in the bonus venue for free. This includes faithful Harmonix bands such as Freezepop, Bang Camaro, and Honest Bob. Along with a well-rounded set list that comes packed on the game, Harmonix has raised the bar on the download side as well. Bringing something new just about every week, they have strived to make this game last through its open ended DLC side. Along with promising full albums to be available, they have worked on at least a dozen songs that are available through the PS Network. Along with the download content side, the online functionality is what you would expect by now including a face off and pro face off mode. These are accented by a band quick play mode where you pick a song and three people can jump in and play it over the internet. These are solid modes and there is no real lag to speak of. It is however discouraging that the games most prominent mode, Band World Tour, is not offered as an online mode. Band World Tour is where this title really shines. It recreates the aspect of being the leader of a real band. You and a friend or three form a band and begin a journey to the top. As Bon Scott once said though, \"It\\'s a long way to the top, if you wanna rock and roll.\" This is the case here as well, for you start as a no nothing band playing little tiny hole-in-the-wall venues to a crowd of 50 or so. You play songs or sets of songs and gain fans and stars in the process. The more fans and stars you gain the more venues and songs open up to you along with other opportunities such as obtaining a tour bus or a record contract. Sure you end up playing the same songs A LOT but its fun as crap to play. Plus the whole coming together experience that you have when you and your friends are rocking out really is priceless. Luckily there are plenty of fresh DLC to add into your set lists to keep things somewhat fresh. Cut free from the tidings of Activision and Red Octane, Harmonix seems to know exactly what they want and they prove that they can hold their own as a game developer. Aside from the sheer magnitude of the peripheral failures, mine included, this game really has few drawbacks. Sure you could argue for more songs on the disc but that is just picking at air. The game offers exactly what it intends to offer, the complete rock band experience. Since the day it was announced people have been eager to see this baby in action. After seeing it, it is clear who the winner is in the battle of rhythm games and it is also clear that this game has raised the bar for the genre. You would have to be pretty incredible to top what Harmonix has laid frame for. With all that this game does, it deserves the 10 out of 10 from me. It may not be perfect, but my 10 rating isn\\'t for that. A 10 game for me is something \"revolutionary\" and it is clear that that is exactly what Rock Band is. Paving the way for a greater gaming experience and bringing it one step closer to the \"real as real can get!\" Keep rockin\\'! \\xa010 out of 10 (5 out of 5) > Revolutionary',\n",

       " {'deck': 'Indigo Prophecy: A True \"Cinematic Game\"',\n",
       "  'description': \"Indigo Prophecy is a game that not all gamers can agree upon is a definitively good game. It defies the convention set by most other games before it. It's not an action game of any sort. It isn't an RPG with spiky-haired people. Nor is it anything else that can be classified under typical gaming standards. Instead, Indigo Prophecy serves its contents as a game for the gamers who prefer being compelled over being addicted by providing numerous unorthodox things that combine to be a unique package that hasn't ever been conceived nor will ever likely be conceived again soon.  The game is essentially like an interactive movie where one can affect the various nuances of the plot on a level that is exponentially greater than what most games allow. It starts off this trend by placing you in the shoes of Lucas Kane, a man who has committed a murder that he feels was against his own willpower. As it happened to take place in a restaurant's restroom, Lucas is not alone when his actions have taken place. As the body lies before him, he needs to figure out what to do quickly so he can leave the vicinity and thusly begin his journey of contemplation.  It's at this point where the game puts Lucas' fate in the player's hands. The restroom and its inhabitants have business to take care of, and it's up to the player to determine how it's conducted. Many choices present themselves already at this point in the game. The game provides some ideas about what to do to get past this point in the plot, but leaves the rest up to the gamer. If they choose, they can leave the crime scene early, taking care of only the essentials to allow for a quick getaway and not seem too obvious around other people. Or, they could decide to put a little more effort into covering up the evidence, making it harder for Lucas to be tracked down by investigators. What one chooses to do at many points like this in the game can have effects on how future events play out, even ones in a very immediate future.  One doesn't just control Lucas Kane over the course of Indigo Prophecy's story, though. They'll also be playing as other characters, mainly those on the other side of the spectrum from Lucas: the investigators. Two people, Tyler and Carla, are tasked with figuring out the killer at the restaurant and their motive. They do so in the typical ways one would expect from investigators, from searching for clues to interviewing witnesses to even creating a mug shot (with your help). How good of a job they do, like with Lucas, is up to you. You could choose to have them pick up every hint of Lucas at every chance. Or, you could let them overlook a few things and see what turns the investigations take from there. Their competency is up to you.  The whole time you're controlling the main characters in the game, you're doing so in a rather unusual way. The control scheme in this game isn't overly convoluted, like in many others. Instead, they usually rely on the two analogue sticks and the two shoulder buttons. That's it. Just four parts on the controller do everything you need to do. It may sound odd at first, but it really does work. While the left analog stick is used to move the characters around (albeit rather sluggishly, no thanks to the camera), the right analogue stick is used for doing all of the characters' actions. (The camera is controlled with the left and right trigger buttons, although the right analog stick can also be used for viewing things at odd angles.) If they're pushing a door open, one will do so by pushing upward on the right analog stick. If they're trying to climb something, the player will mimic the way the arms move by having the analog stick swing to the side and over to climb the object. All of these actions, among many others, are mapped to the right analog stick in an effort to make things somewhat intuitive, which is enhanced when the game asks the player to take their time doing these actions, ensuring that it is the course they want to take. If one does the action too quickly, the game will think the player has decided against doing the action. But if they take the time to do it at a more proper pace, then the character will obey and the action will be done.  But the right analog stick isn't just used for actions. It's also used during the numerous conversations that are to be had in the game. During the times when a main character is talking to someone else, various responses will show up with a time limit. It's up to the player to choose what to say for the next part of the talk. The decision is once again made with the right analog stick by tilting it in the way the response indicates. The choices in such situations can range from things such as what mood to take on for the next response to what question one feels needs the most attention next. The plot may not be overly affected by many (not all) of these choices other than what happens immediately after the choice is made. However, subtleties do lie in the game that can come as a result of the things that happened during the talk, which can be interesting to pick up if you remember such things.  There's a little bit more to the gameply after considering these things, but not too much. In fact, there's really only two more notable facets to the gameplay in Indigo Prophecy that should be noted. One that shows up involves the analog sticks yet again, prompting you to move both of them during specific sequences in the game. The times these show up can be as dramatic as some of the games action sequences to as modest as a line of questions from police. Failing to move the analog sticks the way the game tells you can have major consequences, sometimes death. However, that likely won't happen often, as these sequences are easy enough to tackle, even at a faster rate, thanks to the fact that the game conveys these commands in a non-obtrusive way on the screen. (This also allows one to get a good view of what's happening while one is participating in it.)  The other major facet of Indigo Prophecy's gameplay involves the left and right trigger buttons. At times, Lucas (or another character) will have to exert some major physical energy to get these things done. Usually, this involves heaving something heavy, but other physically demanding times use this facet as well. During those times, the player has to button mash the trigger buttons to keep the character working hard to accomplish the task at hand. While this is an interesting way to get the player to feel some endurance that the character may be having, this can be tiring on the fingers during a few times that do this, as there is at least one time where it is truly excessive when this part of the gameplay shows up. But nevertheless, it's still yet another way that the game is successfully compelling during the course of its story.  There's also a “sanity meter” that shows up during the gameplay. It functions like a health meter would in other games, where if it bottoms out, the character dies. However, this meter takes on mental, not physical, health for this meter. Thus, the way the meter is influenced is by the reactions the characters have to certain events. If a character gets into an argument with someone, then it can lessen. But if something good happens, then the meter will raise. Beyond the dying thing, though, this meter has virtually no influence on the game. No matter what mental state a character may be in, they'll still act the same way. This is rather odd, as one would expect that perhaps the dialog would change with one's mental state. But instead, the characters just always act the same no matter what. Even if they're depressed, they won't show it unless the plot automatically calls for it.  The entire ride, though, is a rather short one. The game can be completed within six to eight hours. For some, that may or may not justify the price tag that may have been paid for the game. But the plot of the game (even if it does indeed go freaky towards the end of the game) makes it well worth it. As such, since the game is so short, it's recommended that, if one has the time to do so, to just go and play the game in one sitting. It is indeed very much like a movie in that regard, where interrupting the plot before it's over can degrade the experience a tad. It's not meant to be put on hold for long, as Indigo Prophecy is presented in a way that is just meant to be experienced from start to finish, even the amount of time it takes is essentially as long as watching an extended edition of one of Peter Jackson's “Lord of the Rings” movies twice.  The presentation of the rest of the game beyond its plot is somewhat modest. The visuals are certainly not eye candy in any way at all. The models for all of the characters are decent, as are their motion-captured animation. But everything in the game in the game that there is to see is on par with what one would expect a game's graphics to be at minimum these days (although by no means are the game's graphics bad).  The sounds of the game are kind of there, per se. Some things, like footsteps, are really hard to pick up, which can deceive one into thinking that Quantic Dream just didn't put the effort into making the sound in the first place. But the other sounds come out just fine, with everything else sounding the way it should when the sound pops up.  All of the characters in the game do speak, however. The voice actors do an O.K. Job at projecting the lines they're given. They give the characters emotion when the time calls for it and they do make the characters seem believable enough (even if the corresponding lip-syncing is usually bad). However, even if the game is meant to be like an interactive movie, the voice acting doesn't quite reach the quality of movies themselves. It seems as though the game tries to do its best in that regard, but was only able to do so with B-list quality voices.  The music in the game is a hit-or-miss at most times. While many of the classical music pieces that show up in the game do a superb job at helping create the mood of the game, other pieces of music usually do a less-than-stellar job. The game licenses music from several artists, but usually does little with them over the course of the main game. One can listen to them during times where a character has free time, but the music isn't that good enough to really justify listening to multiple. The only real low point in the music is most likely when one has to listen to Tyler's bizarre funk theme song, which just appears to be out of place every time it comes up and just sounds bad overall.  Indigo Prophecy is certainly not a game for all gamers. It has a pacing that many are unaccustomed to, as well as a story to back up that pacing. There are also a few things that can be griped about in general about the game, which could turn some people away. However, the experience to be had with the game, despite a few hindrances, may well be worth it, even if it is for only a short time. But during that time, those who are open enough will discover a unique game with experiences that aren't to be found anywhere else. Truly, this game is an obscure gem in all ways.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Hmm, Condemned 2. Where do I begin? Why not some good. The first game was one of the best launch titles for the 360, and probably the only one worth buying. It had its share of scares, combat, and grossness. How does the new one stand up to it? Well, you don't have to worry about them being the exact same game. This one is way different from the first one, actually adding a lot of new content. First off, definitely the combat. The attacks feel good and fluid, and generally the hit detection is spot on. Multiplayer may be different, but its probably just the lag. The sound is incredible, and everything sounds amazing. The gunfire is generic, but not that bad. Graphics are modest, but they are really good for making you scared. Such as lighting and gloom effects are spot on. Oh yeah. This game is SCARY. Maybe not to some, but for others, it will make you want to play with all the lights on, and maybe a person watching you. The atmosphere is great, the lighting is great, the sound is great, and all that will come to together and scare the crap out of you. Now the bad. The multi-player. No I'm not saying its bad. No I'm not saying its good either. Its pretty much generic. I cant say I like the deathmatch and team deathmatch, simply because everyone will eventually gather into a huge ball of fist throwing and kill stealing. But bum rush and especially crime scene are loads of fun, and will give you something to do for a few days. Now the actual bad. VOICE ACTING! The voice acting is all modest, except some people its terrible. Did the newscaster know she was voice ACTING? Her voice annoyed me, simply cause it sounded like they got her off the street to read lines. Also whats bad, the screen will get really blurry during the hallucination scenes, and a lot of the levels seemed put there since they were a good idea the developers had. The story is okay, but it really becomes stupid at the later levels. And now on to the new stuff. Combos and the investigations. The combos are tough to pull off, but are pretty cool, and the investigations are cool, but they get pretty tough. Finding out whats arterial splatter and random splatter is tough, simply cause I what the heck some of the answers are. But overall, the games a great horror game, and a pretty good edition to any Xbox 360 or PS3 owner.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Army of Two is one reminds me of one of those B-rated action movies. You have Rios, a battle-hardened soldier who looks like he\\'s seen enough death in his lifetime, and Salem, a young spunky kid who\\'s every other word is \"bro\" They start off in the army and figure out that mercenaries make a shit-load more money and apparently get to choose their own missions. This of course leads to them joining a PMC (Private Military Corporation) where they get to wear masks and pimp out their guns. \\xa0This of course leads to more B-movie material where you would have to be brain dead to not see a major plot point coming up.Speaking of brain-dead, that is essentially what your computer-controlled partner is. He\\'ll shoot enemies and take cover, but only if you\\xa0explicitly\\xa0tell him to. This is fine, until later levels when bullets are hailing down on you and you have to keep checking whether or not your partner has enough health to keep shooting or if he needs to take cover. Another annoying aspect about the Ai is when you get damaged enough you fall to the ground and have to wait for your partner to come drag you to safety and heal you. This seems a little too much for the computer to handle as you will be screaming at the screen for your partner to heal you or drag you to cover as the computer seems to know what you want it to do, but chooses to do the opposite.The gunplay however is pretty solid with a pretty set of customizable options available such as changing the barrels and cartridges on your gun, adding silencers, and even pimping out your gun. Yes, you heard me, you can have a pimped out .45 magnum and yes, it is just as awesome as it sounds. This of course affects a key element of Army of Two which is aggro. People who play MMORPG\\'s probably know this, but basically if you are shooting then you build up aggro which makes the enemies shoot at you and your partner is essentially invisible. This works very well when fighting your enemies. Maybe a little too well... While your partner shoots at the enemy, you can just go to the enemies and shoot them and they won\\'t really notice as long as your partner has the aggro.The game is fitted with a pretty good soundtrack of rock which is really the only genre needed to get in the mood for a game like Army of Two. The voice acting is pretty good, and the characters are likeable. The game also looks pretty good with the main character models being the eye candy. However many of the enemies look exactly the same and some of the textures in the environments can get a little bland.This game is also incredibly short. You will probably be able to beat this game in 5-6 hours and I never got a chance to play the multi-player since not enough people were on for me to play a match. So would recommend you rent this game if you want to try it.This review is pretty negative I know, so why does it get 3 stars? Well the game is pretty fun. Bashing enemies with your helmet, customizing your weapons, and running through missions guns blazing is pretty fun and Army of Two does a good job of this. So I recommend if you want a fun weekend and have a friend to play with, rent Army of Two and I can say you will probably have a blast.',\n",

       "  'description': 'With a guy like Slash on the cover, it must be good right? Heh, say what you will about the guy, half the people like him, the other half don\\'t. I don\\'t suppose you could guess which camp I fall into. But joking aside, does the next iteration of Guitar Hero live up to all the hype? Well that is the question. It is Guitar Hero, as you remember it, with a plethora of songs to be shredded on the new Wireless Les Paul. A few new additions attempt to bring the growing staleness of the title to new heights, but with the sale of the series to Neversoft, you really notice where the game falls short, and that is in quite a few places.First lets discuss the newness. This incorporates an all-new set list boasting 71 songs, 40 of which appear as the game\\'s core gameplay in career mode. Alternately there are 6 songs exclusive to the two player co-op career mode, which is great, if you know someone who has a guitar and is willing to come over and spend some hours blazing through it. Unfortunately for those who don\\'t have that friend are left high and dry short of cheating to get those songs. Another factor to consider is the fact that the guitar isn\\'t even offered by itself, so even if you did want to jam with you significant other, you are SOL unless you enjoy having two copies of the game lying around. Then there are the songs themselves. Along with a terrible cover of Paranoid the tracks leave something to be desired. Aside from the 20+ bonus tracks from not very well known bands, the core songs really aren\\'t that great. I would venture a guess to about 15 or 20 that you might really want to play, with the rest being fluff. There is more then one time when you say, \"Will this annoying song ever end?!?\" I am sure that there is a good base of people who would enjoy more then that but as for the entire group of us, I doubt it.The co-op exclusiveness isn\\'t the only big flaw in planning. The biggest new addition, whether you love it or hate it, and there is no gray area there, is the boss battles. Neversoft has created this new system of guitar battling which uses, of all things, power-ups to defeat your opponent. You face off against Tom Morello from the late band Rage Against the Machines, and Slash from the late Guns\\' n\\' Roses. Along with another devilish opponent, you and your foe go toe to toe in a custom song all the while trying to screw them over to the point of failure. If you don\\'t succeed, your opponent automatically wins a draw. Now aside from the completely broken balance of this system, i.e. someone strikes first and the other is stuck trying to recover the entire time, this mode really just isn\\'t any fun. If you were ever excited about it when it was announced, you will be disappointed. The idea, is sort of neat, but the implementation is completely lacking and gives it more of a tacked on after thought feel. Along with the boss battle system, Sony fans get something else new to the series, multiplayer action. Now you can jam with, or against, people from all over. Just another way for people to find out that there is always someone out there who is better then they are at the game. But seriously, the online is solid and surprisingly enough has really good reliability. You don\\'t have to worry about lag, which is key in rhythm games and the gameplay is really smooth. You can play battle, co-op, or face off, all of which work seamlessly. With all the talk and praise of the new Les Paul controller, really the actual peripheral comes up quite short. Aside from the basic Guitar Hero feature, the only real differences are, you can remove the neck, you can change the faceplate, and its wireless. Now wireless isn\\'t something to laugh at, everyone loves wireless guitar rocking, but the number of times that this overly glorified feature have been mentioned during production really takes away from who great it really is to be able to rock from your couch or what have you. The absolute worst part of the controller is the complete lack of backwards compatibility. Therefore, gamers, myself included, who own a backwards compatible PS3 will not be able to play the older Guitar Hero games with this controller. This to me seems like a real missed opportunity for a little extra revenue that Neversoft is so greedy for. Removing the neck is convenient for storage purposes but again, not a real winner of a feature. Changing of the faceplate is sort of lame in reality. Sony has offered skins for both their PSP and the PS2 but no one really uses that to the point where it\\'s a great feature. If anything else, this is just another cheap way for Neversoft to squeeze more pennies out of your wallet. All in all, you feel a lot of cheapness from this game. Certainly not from the price tag, but you definitely feel it in the overall experience. Along with shameless plugs for Axe Body Spray and other products, the whole presentation feels a little cheap, especially for a \"current gen\" game. The graphics are not as played up as they should be. The sound is a bit quirky and will cut out on you at times. Really the number of songs should be higher as well. With a Blue Ray disc, you have so much room for storage and there hasn\\'t been a game yet, this one included, that really gives you that sense that you get all the bang for your buck. With lofty ambitions set by the user base, Guitar Hero III really falls short and with their obvious money centric presentation, this title really isn\\'t all its cracked up to be. If you are looking for the same old Guitar Hero experience however, then look no further, because flawed though the game may be, it is the same Guitar Hero style that you know and love and even though it doesn\\'t pull its weight to bring it to the big rankings, it does get the 6 out of 10 rating from me which puts it at the solid level of a \"Fun\" playing experience.',\n",

       " {'deck': 'Lost Odyssey',\n",
       "  'description': \"My name is Adam and I'm a turn-based combat-aholic. My other confession? Lost Odyssey is my first Japanese RPG and I can say without a doubt that it won't be my last. Almost every moment of this game is a beautiful and moving experience. An experience stretched over 4 discs and 45 hours, but one worth all that time and effort. This was never a game I thought I'd play. With a full-time job, 13 month old son, starting up\\xa0 a new business, etc. etc. I have no right to set aside forty hours of my life to just one game, but I'm so glad I did. Once that first disc goes in and the cinematics kick off, you fall under it's spell and enter a fantastical magical world. Playing as Kaim, an immortal wiped of his memories, you start in the midst of an epic battle, interrupted by a deadly meteor impact. From there you begin a journey to reclaim your memories and investigate Grand Staff - the centre of a new and potentially unstable magic energy plant. The journey of the game is all about the characters as opposed to the plot. Kaim is a brooding and dour hero with little show of positive emotions and a far too serious nature - something that would be disastrous on its own but is countered by a tremendous ensemble cast. The most notable is Jansen, a wise-cracking, womanising mortal who balances out the seriousness of the immortals and also adds a touch of realism to the characters. It's within the group that the real story lies. The plot of main game is cliched and follows an obvious path, but acts only as a carrier for the gripping development and self-discovery of the characters. This self-discovery is told in conventional cut-scene form and also in the form of 'dreams', small fragments of the immortals memories that surface as your progress through the game. These dreams are essentially short stories shown on screen in text form. Wait! Text? On a screen? Boring surely? Well no. The whole manner of their presentation is a tribute to the game's art design. The text of these memories are revealed slowly and sometimes dynamically as you read with still, sometimes hand drawn, images fading in and out at appropriate moments. This, coupled with a truly melting and melodic soundtrack provides some of the most moving moments of the game. On several occasions I was reduced to tears whilst reading. Not the 'I've-got-somehting-in-my-eye' tears but full on baby-weeping, inconsolable, the world is ending tears. It's these moments, followed by a heart-wrenching scene about Kaim's daughter and grandchildren, that make the first disc a complete sob-fest and genuinely moving you to care deeply about the characters you play. This leads on to a minor gripe that the story never really reaches those dramatic heights again - not to say it isn't compelling from that moment on, but the rest of the game merely fades back into being excellent rather than life-changeling so. The other problem is the translation of the stories. Some are fine but many others suffer from an odd word or turn of phrase that doesn't quite fit in with the epic scope of the theme. This might partly be due to the American localisation as well as translating the text from the original Japanese. But still, it's a minor gripe and doesn't detract too much from the experience. I found that the english language audio was also waaaaay too American for my tastes and turning it back to the Japanese with subtitles made the experience richer by far. In terms of gameplay we have a very traditional turn-based combat system which, dammit, I like a lot. Although the pre-battle muscle flexing can get tiring after a while, as does the random battles - something that surely should be a thing of the past by now? Aside from those minor quibbles Lost Odyssey is a tremendous work of art and regardless of any time constraints you may have is worth devoting as much of your life to it as possible. In 45 hours of gameplay I only got frustrated once - and that was facing the final boss. For the record I managed to beat the game with most characters on level 49-50, not particularly high for a game like this. A word also about the soundtrack. Beautiful. It has a perfect blend of delicate instrumental tracks and migraine-inducing techno-splurge. The music for the final boss is just an epic orgasm of rock guitar and a double choir - something that should be downloadable for Rock Band surely? Conclusion The maker of Metal Gear Solid, Hideo Kojima, was recently quoted saying that he wanted his game to make people change the way they look at the world or feel about certain issues. I'm not sure if he succeeded in his game but Mistwalker certainly has with theirs.\\xa0 I came away from parts of this story feeling more alive and more drained of emotion than any film or book in recent memory - it's not preachy or blatent in any message or moral issue, it's just an excellent blend of storytelling and gameplay with memorable characters and a fantastical world.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'So when I first picked up this game I didn\\'t really know what to expect, I know the game was a supposedly going to be more single player focussed but being a battle field game I was more excited for the multiplayer.First thing you will notice about the game is a great visuals, the game looks really nice with great explosions and a huge draw distance but that said there were only two things that bugged me about them, the first being the filter put over\\xa0the picture. Sure\\xa0is makes the game feel a little more\\xa0gritty but overall just detracts for the all-round visual look of the game, leaving the game to look grainy. The second thing which\\xa0bugged me was the \"destructible\" environments. Sure it is only a new thing to be done, well at least\\xa0in the way that\\xa0it was done in this game.\\xa0On the\\xa0whole it was fine but sometimes it\\xa0didn’t work as good as other times. Some buildings don\\'t blow up apart naturally, because the way they blow up is very geometrical, so if you shoot a rocket at one wall it will leave a square hole which you can walk straight through but the you can walk around to the other side of the same building and shoot a grenade launcher at the wall (which is the same type as the previous wall) and then it will leave the same shape hole as the one of the other side. I am sure there are a lot of reasons why the developers chose this route but to me it sometimes felt a little clunky. But that said the games visuals are still great and suit the games style.  The game play in bad company is what you come to expect with a console FPS these days with a few unique changes. Instead of taking the ‘hide behind cover to regain health’ system the developer stuck with the numerical health system but what makes it unique is that instead of finding health packs you have a needle/epee-pen which you can jab yourself with to regain you health to 100% unless you are playing multiplayer when only a the medic can do it but is also able to supply med kits which slowly build up your health as long as you are close enough to one. Another thing that makes the game a little more unique is just the size of the levels. They are absolutely massive in both single and multi player and this helps add to the game with the large use of vehicles which let you move across these larges maps with ease. One weird thing about the vehicles is the control for them, even though it doesn’t get in the way its just takes a while to get used to.   Then there is the games single player. I found it interesting but it’s still not up to par with other First Person Shooters out on the market. The story has its moments but all round isn’t very solid with a predictable ending and few plot twists. The story only seems to be there to tie together the missions and set a scene and nothing much else. Although It’s not a bad story, A couple of the characters are fun to watch and have a lot of personality with the help of some good voice acting but the characters themselves aren’t enough to turn the story into a great one. It finished with a bit of a predictable finale but you don’t fell disappointed. So even though the single player feels like a set of missions strung to gather with a mediocre story it’s still enjoyable.  Then there is the multiplayer, this is the true star of the show. It has a full ranking system with upgrades and a ton of huge maps to play on. The only bad thing is that there is only one game mode to play. The hole point of the game is a attack and defend sort of thing. One team must defend the gold creates while the other team has to attack and push the other team back until all gold creates are destroyed. \\xa0It’s a fun game mode and I am yet to get tired of it but if you are expecting a COD4 experience you might be disappointed.   So all together it’s a nice package, with an OK single player and a fun multiplayer all with detectable environments and good visuals it’s defiantly worth a look. I think as long as you don’t go in with huge expectations you won’t be disappointed. ',\n",

       "  'description': 'Tired of seeing the same old places and same old things from the beaches of Normandy circa 1942? Well Infinity Ward is right there with you. Feeling that their popular World War II franchise is turning a bit stale, they thought they might take a new approach to that oh so tired out series. Ripped straight from the day\\'s headlines, Call of Duty 4: Modern warfare puts you right in the thick of battle as it is today, not as it was 60 some odd years ago. It is arguably the best representation of a modern day war zone that you can play on a console today. The game has dramatic lighting for a truly realistic feel. The audios and visuals poured through this title are awe-inspiring and make you hard pressed to think of a game that delivers them better. Rolled up with excellent gameplay mechanics and implementation, Call of Duty 4 puts you as close as you can possibly get, or want to get, to the real action.The dev. team has really gone all out with this one. They have poured detail into this game much as you pour water in a glass. And you know how you can fill it so high that it has a little rounded look at the top? Well that is how you can think of level of attention given to detail they have put into this game. That is they used as much of the power available to support little things that they could without overflowing and making a mess of things. The ability that they have shown in being able to harness the raw power available in the PS3 hardware is first of its kind and hopefully a trend setting as well. You will notice everything from the dialogue during combat from your squad mates to the ricochet of bullets off of your cover, to the casting of shadow though out open levels, there truly is no better first person shooter for this console then this one. So what about the game itself? Aside from boasting a nice multiplayer package, it does have a single player campaign that delivers a satisfaction unparalleled all be it a short one. The combat spins off of two main characters, the first being a British soldier by the codename Soap. Under the lead of Captain Price, you make your way through the equivalent of a tutorial level to teach you the ropes before being thrown right into some shady business upon a boat. After a bit of action as Soap, you then take the role of Jackson, one of America\\'s finest from the USMC. As you would expect, you see many a combat zone with this guy including many times when you find yourself being shot at from all directions. Even though the story here is shorter then most, it does deliver on a level that surpasses any in the genre. It is no cakewalk either. A lot of times you will find yourself pushing upon a dug in enemy to get to some point before some timer runs out. These timed parts can be extremely frustrating. Throw in an unreliable checkpoint restart mechanic and you\\'ve got yourself a recipe for throwing controllers, if you are so inclined to do so. At any rate you can\\'t help but feel like you accomplished something when finally do finish the campaign.Any way you slice it, this is one intense experience. Whether it\\'s storming through a TV broadcasting station, crawling through tall grass between enemy troops, or jumping across a collapsing bridge, this action packed game will fulfill its promise to deliver modern warfare to you and even though the campaign is short, it is still fun and full of great times worth playing through again, perhaps in arcade mode where you are rewarded with points for your efforts. The only snag in the otherwise solid gameplay is the failure of the game to recognize checkpoints, sometimes you have to start a few checkpoints back from where you should have started, of course if you don\\'t die you won\\'t have to worry about that. All in all the game is good and delivers an experience that is \"Above and Beyond\" what is expected, making it a 9 on my ten point scale. So what are you waiting for? Go get yourself a copy! \\xa0',\n",

       "  'description': 'Welcome to Silent Hill. Or welcome back to Silent Hill if this is not your first SH game. For me it\\'s not, I\\'ve played through all the 4 (now 5) titles of this wonderful franchise (my favorite actually) and intend to replay them for as long as I live. I\\'m what you could call a SH-maniac.  So, does SH0 disappoint or not?  No. It does not. Let\\'s divide this review into different categories:  01 - STORY The story is very good and very reminiscent of SH2 (because of the emotional part), but not going into many details (I don\\'t want to spoil it to you) it goes like this: Travis Grady is a trucker, driving into his next destiny/job. On the way he decides to go past Silent Hill for a shortcut but something happens, a little girl crosses his way (sounds familiar?) and he stops and there\\'s nothing out there. In the reflexion of his side-mirror he sees the little girl again and follows the road to a house on fire. After saving the little girl, Travis faints and wakes up in a misterious foggy place, a street, clouded by fog. Silent Hill. He decides to check out the hospital and see how\\'s the little girl doing. But something is not right... || 9/10  02 - CONTROLS The controls are very responsive and the animations of movement are very fluid. There\\'s a slight wait of like 1 second after you press SQUARE for Travis to run. But this is probablyon purpose because, let\\'s face it, if it was real you would also waste a second to start your full run. So this adds to the credibility of the game and the difficulty. Also, Travis gets tired (wich was missing from the other SH\\'s), thankfully there are energy drinks scattered around town for you to keep running (specially in town when the straightjackets are all running towards you!). So this is something else that adds to both reality and difficulty of the game. Also, thank God for the shortcut for the weapons (by pressing the directional buttons) a la Silent Hill 4 wich is awesome if your weapon breaks or you waste all your bullets \\'cause you don\\'t need to open the menu and navigate through all the menus to get where you want or use and medicinal pack or drink. You use the analogic to move around, CROSS to check/pick up objects and use doors etc; TRIANGLE to access your map (very useful as usual); and CIRCLE to toggle your flashlight on/off (remember this is very useful to hide from monsters and sneak past them!). You also use R1 to go to your fight pose/aim and CROSS (while R1 is pressed) to attack/shoot. So the controls are easy to learn and easy to get, no difficulty here and very good response. || 10/10.  03 - GRAPHICS The graphics are some of the best you\\'ll see on PSP, and the static effects (when you get close to monsters) are very similar to when Henry was close to ghosts on Silent Hill 4. Very cool. The screen flashes red on the sides to warn you when your health is very low, so keep an eye on this. The sceneries are totally awesome specially on the \"other-world\" where they become gruesome and blood splattered. The monsters are very well modeled/animated and very very gruesome/disgusting. I love the \"plastic\" effect they have too. The character models could have more details on them, but nothing that will get in your way. I had a very funny experience with this, while I was fighting a monster the camera was right between Travis and a Wall and Travis leans backwards to attack the monster and the camera goes inside Travis\\' head LOL it was the scariest thing I\\'ve ever seen. Back to being serious, everything on this category was great. || 9/10  04 - ATMOSPHERE So, we know this looks like Silent Hill by now, but does it FEEL like Silent Hill? Hell yeah it does! The fog is there, the radio is there, the flashlight is there, the monsters are the there. The town is there. Along with some familiar characters (one of wich was really BAD on this game =\\\\). Apart from this character, we\\'ll be visiting some familiar spots and majorly new ones (yay!). Also, the music Akira Yamaoka makes (wich is perfect!) and the sound effects he produced (wich are also top notch) make a huge difference on the atmosphere (more macabre and frightning). || 10/10  05 - SOUND AND MUSIC As I said in the previous category, Akira Yamaoka\\'s music/sound is perfect (as usual) and fits the whole game/ambience/story so well that will make you cry... in fear. :) GO AKIRA!! || 10/10  06 - REPLAY?! This game is scary and excelent for the first time. But on the times to follow you probably won\\'t be as scared (if scared at all). The game is missing some \"WTF?!\" moments that we were used to see on other Silent Hills, but this does not mean you won\\'t like replaying it and you won\\'t have anything to aim for. You do, and lots of stuff. This game presents a new mechanic called ACCOLADES, each time you do something specific you will unlock costumes or weapons (or other cool stuff). Also there\\'s loads of spots you can check out in town that you won\\'t be visiting the first time because you\\'ll be too worried running away from the freaking jogging straightjackets! And now, here\\'s the major downside to the game. It\\'s SO - FREAKING - SHORT! I finished it in 4 hours the first time, and in 1 HOUR the second time (the UFO ending is indeed like 40 min before the true end of the game, but even so you will probably finish the whole thing with 1 hour and 30/40 minutes the second/thirt/etc time you go through it). This does not mean it\\'s not fun and you will want to play it again and again either for the adrenaline of killing monsters and stuff or to see the 3 different endings (you will want to see them, specially the BAD ENDING, wich is the true ending to the game) and getting all the accolades. So yeah, there\\'s a lot of stuff to do here. Aside from the accolades system you will get the EXTRA OPTIONS (the ones you see in all the other SHs) only after you finish it once (it has some new options there too).   So, is this your first time on Silent Hill? I\\'d suggest you play the other ones first as you will understand the plot a LOT better. But, if you are already playing this before playing the other ones, keep going, because on the good side, you will want to play the other games to get the whole (well not whole) thing straight. Could be a better prequel as it does not tell you much of the beginning of the story (or even Alessa\\'s father) but it\\'s entertaining to play just for Travis\\' story. It does get some of Alessa\\'s background straigh thought, wich is good, and explains what really happened before Slent Hill 1 (it\\'s a direct prequel). Now I want a prequel to the prequel. Lol.  So if you\\'re a Silent Hill or Survival Horror fan and own a PSP this is a MUST PLAY! Excelent game with great quality. Climax really did it! Of course Akira Yamaoka (GOD) had clearly his finger on it (you can see by the previous version of the game).  OVERALL || 9.5 (5 Stars)  Excelent game! \\t\\t',\n",

       "  'description': \"Grand Theft Auto the three little words that spark controversy with parents and politicians and is also the game that sparks excitement in the hearts of gamers. Grand Theft Auto is one of the biggest players in the video game industry selling millions of copies and has a place in pop culture. Grand Theft Auto IV is one the most anticipated video games of all time and not only has it delivered on the hype it has surpassed it, making Grand Theft Auto IV one of the greatest games ever made. But what makes Grand Theft Auto IV so special? Very simply put the attention to detail. Rockstar Games have done a phenomenal job in making Liberty City a living breathing world. When it rains citizens take out umbrellas and those that don't have one use there newspaper , when you kill somebody that is riding a car they fall on the steering wheel and the horn sounds off, while sprinting if you run into someone they'll get knocked down and drop there coffee. What adds more weight to this detail is the graphics; Grand Theft Auto IV is easily one of the best looking games this console generation. Adding more to this the incredible soundtrack that's fits game so well, no matter what you're into you'll find a radio station for you, and probably the best thing about this game is the rich characters Rockstar games are known for each of them is unique. The best thing about Grand Theft Auto IV is the gameplay, Rockstar Games have done a great job in remaking the aiming system and have also implemented a cover system which works really well. The controls might take time to getting use to but once mastered you well have a blast. The missions in Grand Theft Auto IV are varied and exciting and do provide a challenge. Grand Theft Auto IV main story quest will last around 30 hours plus and on top of that there are plenty of side missions which adds to the replay value. Grand Theft Auto IV is one of the greatest games ever made and gamers all around need to play this.\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'BLACK and boom',\n",
       "  'description': \"BLACK was on many a wish list for quite some time before launch, and in many respects lived up to they hype. However, there is very rarely perfection in a game, and BLACK has its share of flaws that detract from the awesome graphics and initially intense gameplay. Playing the role of a Black-Ops agent, your mission is to hunt down and eliminate the leader of a shadowy terrorist organisation called Seventh Wave. In the somewhat limited story, Seventh wave are international in their scope but strangely restrictive on their recruitment policy - only hiring Russian-speaking mercenaries to do their work. There is also intrigue as you discover that the reason for your enforced debriefing - shown as cutscenes between each mission that actually takes place after the events in the game - is not as clear cut as you think. The action in BLACK takes place in a number of locations across a fictional Eastern European city, from abandoned, war-torn city streets to fields and abandoned farmhouses, from an abandoned asylum to a prison. Which is also abandoned. Surprisingly. In many ways, BLACK is a powerhouse of a game. It promises Hollywood-style action, and by God, does it do that in spades. The first time you play, you will be blown away (no pun intended) by the simple act of launching a rocket into an office building or church tower, only to watch all the windows on one floor blow out. (or in the case of the church, the tower collapse completely). And although the grenade-throwing mechanic feels a little clunky, you will marvel at the explosions that ensue. And don't even get me started on intense shoot-outs in tiled communal bathrooms - stuff flying everywhere! And this, in one way, is BLACK's strongest feature - it manages to squeeze just about every iota of processing power out of the old Xbox, producing a game that, being honest, looked next-gen before there was a next gen. In fact, it actually puts some next-gen games to utter shame. The Treneska Border crossing level, for example, is set in woodland, and the fact that grass is rendered here a la Call of Duty 3 is a marvel. Lighting and fogging effects add to the stunning imagery, and all in all, you are left wishing that, somehow, game developers had managed to figure all this out a lot earlier in the lifecycle of the beloved console. To watch an RPG round head towards its target, leaving a plume of smoke in its wake, is a joy. Sound is also very well done, with much whizzing of bullets, ricochets and environmental sounds. Some of the weapons sound a little lifeless, admittedly, but they are LOUD. The enemy chatter is intriguing at first, all in (what sounds like) Russian, although the variation is limited, and gets a bit repetitive after a while. The in-game music is excellent for the most part, with a stirring main title theme in which Michael Guacharo’s presence is obvious. He will be sadly missed from the Medal of Honor franchise! Overall, gameplay is good, with some flaws, but the promise of non-stop action is maintained, at least for a while. But the mechanic is flawed in that there is no variation - it is TOO non-stop. After a little while, you realise that the only thing really keeping you glued is the visual aspect of the game, and even that starts to wear thin after a while. And this, sadly, is where BLACK falls down. Which brings me to the first flaw in this game - overall the story is a little weak and it is difficult to fully engage in the character you play, or his motives. And there are conflicts in the scale of the story - we are led to believe that this is a terrorist organisation you are tasked to destroy, yet, everywhere is destroyed and abandoned. How big is Seventh Wave? Some of the settings look like the Third Reich has steamed its way through, laying waste to everything in its path. There are no local armed forces, just the bad guys, you, and occasionally a couple of teammates to keep you company. These are admittedly niggles only, and there are great games out there with little or no plot at all - yet they are still great. But it is still noticeable. For example, in a game such as Serious Sam, you don't really lament the lack of a story - it doesn't really need one. You shoot alien dudes. But with BLACK, once you start getting into plotlines and exposition, you really feel there should be more to it. And there isn't. Which is a shame, because there cold have been great potential for a Tom Clancy-esque plot here. Once you realise you don't really care why you are doing what you are doing, the interest peters out. Another sticking point is the enemy AI, or lack thereof. Enemy combatant types are not very varied - five in total - and the tactics they employ are: 1 -walk around before you do anything. 2 - once they spot you, shoot at you from wherever they are or run out in the open through your line of fire to get to cover and then shoot at you. 3- when behind over, walk into the open, shoot a bit, go back. Rinse and repeat. The first part of tactic two can make for some intense close up action in places, but sadly the second part of it and third tactic mean that long distance combat is a simple case of lining up your aim for the head the first few times they pop out, pop back, pop out, pop back. It doesn't take long before this starts to feel like an assembly line. Thankfully you will never be short of ammunition - it's lying around in spades - but like other aspects of the game, holding an enemy in place with bullets till he drops get a bit old. It also takes a lot of bullets to take down enemies. And I mean a lot. This is partly explained away by everyone wearing body armor. But it takes something away from the gameplay when you are pumping ten or more shots into a dude before he goes down. And that's just the basic grunt-dudes. Some level of graduation between the basic character classes would have been nice, and also a little more location-specific damage. Some hardcore tension can arise when fighting shotgun dudes, as they take hella damage before keeling over, and can take you out in one or two shots. But after a while of playing the game, you realise that they are totally unable to cope with a circle-strafe maneuver, which takes the edge away. You can cause damage to the game world - trees fall apart, columns shatter, tiled walls are reduced to bare plaster. But whilst this is awesome at first, it doesn’t take long to spot where the damage is built in - visible seam lines in trees, convenient explosive barrels in key locations. It all becomes a bit formulaic. Difficulty is also a bit fractured. On the easiest setting, the challenge is fine until the Asylum level, where the difficulty is suddenly ramped up to something altogether harder. Then the following levels go back to easy, and then the final level again sees a turning up of the difficulty slider. A more gradual toughening would have been better placed here. I can see many less-experienced FPS fans being put off by the sudden change on the Asylum level. And the checkpoint system and lack of player saves does not help matters much here. Lastly, there is no co-op or multiplayer component at all. Perhaps these would have been a little too much to ask, given the demands placed on the console by the single-player campaign on its own. But it is still a shame. So, in conclusion, BLACK is very good game on first play-through, clocking in at between 8-10 hours. But once you know enemy locations, and where there is stuff you can blow up, replay becomes a mindless exercise. It can still be fun every now and then, but you will find yourself playing only the levels you enjoy the most, and then not very often. Some replay value is added by the harder difficulty levels, where extra mission objectives are added. Completing the game means that you unlock silver weapons with unlimited ammo for any for that difficulty level and any below it. Even that is flawed - you can't turn them off, so if you finish easy difficulty and want to play again without unlimited ammo, for a challenge, you can't. This is definitely a show-off game, but I wouldn't buy it new - if it is even still available new nowadays - search out a pre-owned copy, or rent it first. There is fun to be had, but it is to be hoped that the upcoming Xbox 360 version (or second and third sequels, as some rumors state) pick up on the flaws and work to improve them. True next-gen visuals and the removal of the niggles that take this game down a peg or two could make for a truly awesome, replayable and unforgettable experience.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"First of lets say I'm a fan of the Devil May Cry series but this game really shouldn't carry the name.  Dante's disk took me on the first play through less than 4 hours which i just flew through and not in one sitting as the repetitive gameplay becomes mind numbly boring. There is no real story to follow you got through area running and killing demons that’s it.. But DMC has never been known for its story  Gameplay: Its up to the player how to tackle each level if you really wanted to you could just run from A to B fighting the bare minimum of enemies as the levels are allot wider than DMC1 and there isn't really the need to fight them. Only a few areas have locked doors than can be opened only when all enemies in the area are defeated. The gameplay is this hack, slash, shoot, maybe dodge depends how fast you are on the trigger and run to the next level... that’s pretty much it The enemies feel dumbed down nowhere near as hard or vicious as those in DMC1 most will stand still as you run towards them slashing at there fellow demons. Bosses add some challenge but even then its the same old just slash shoot and jump there’s no strategy needed or skill just have to be reasonably good at button bashing.  Graphics: Keeping in mind the game did come out over 3 years ago the graphics are very bland textures look blurry and the enemy character models for some could be copied and pasted but with different colors. The frame rate is always steady though no matter how many characters are on screen and the areas are quite large.  Sound: Devil May Cry is quite well known for its soundtracks which in this game is one of the few things it has in common with the others. It mixes metal goth and an eerily castlevania style music together with great results as absurd as it may seem. Where the sound falls short however is the voice acting.. It’s just terrible the dialog is poorly written and delivered worse Lucia's accent is enough to wish that games didn’t hire voice actors and Dante himself has lost all charm and has become a bland shell of his former self.  Value: Now you could probably find this game going extremely cheap on the used market or even brand new but you really shouldn’t bother its not fun and has no replay value you'll put together a max of maybe 8 hours playing through both discs but you'll wish you hadn’t as there roughly the same with some slight changed between Dante and Lucias missions.  Overall Devil May Cry 2 isn't fit to hold the Devil May Cry name and truly is a disgrace to the series, try your best to avoid it. Try not to buy it your money could be put towards a more deserving game\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Savage 2 - A Tortured Soul is an incredibly unique and ambitious game that has broken many boundaries of the conventional multiplayer game. Developed by the independent studio S2 Games it allowed them to create a truly unique experience that was not restricted by the larger companies who are unwilling to go out of the conventional lines.  Savage 2 pits players against each other each playing as two vastly different teams, the Humans and Beasts. Rather than being a simple reskin of the other army such as in a Battlefield game, the two sides have very distinct differences and play quite differently. For example, the beast side has a Summoner class which utilises pets to attack foes, whereas the Humans have no such class.  The game is similar to the Battlefield franchise as players are given the objective of taking control of the map, but rather than victory points, RTS elements are brought in. One player from each time plays as the 'Commander' who plays out the entire game from an RTS camera view. He builds base defences such as Arrow Towers, Mines to extract gold and further your team's economy, tech buildings to allow players access to more powerful abilities and classes and the amazing Hell Shrine to allow his team access to the powerful Hellbourne units.  Whilst all this is going on, the other players on the team are in a fiece fight to take control around mines and give their commander enough time to get a mine and defences going to ensure they keep control of that portion of the map. The action takes place in Third or First person perspective and is extremely fast paced. Melee combat is balanced in a rock, paper, scissors style and forces players to think rather than simply point and click. Guns, bows and magical staves are fired from the first person and take all the skill of a conventional shooter to use.  As well as offensive classes, the game features healers from either side to support their attacking teammates and keep them from dying. Some of the most spectacular parts of the game are the dramatic siege weapons being unleashed upon the enemy buildings. Players can take control of catapults and battering rams as well as giant tree-wielding troll-like creatures to deal devastating damage to enemy buildings. These weapons are perfectly scaled and the vision of the towering 'Behemoth' wielding its tree trunk is truly epic.  The game promotes team play and strategy, with players having to think on their feet and co-ordinate attacks as well as relying on inherent player skill to take down enemy players.  All in all Savage 2 is a terrific game which should not be missed. It's only downfalls are a lack of players and a few minor bugs, but no more prevelant than in a mainstream title. The free demo account is well worth a look as this is a unique game which really must be experienced to fully understand the breadth of action it has to offer.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"After a extremely long wait, almost a decade, Team Fortess 2 was released and it was totally worth the wait.Team Fortess 2 is a class based multiplayer online shooter. This is one of the best online shooters I have played, it is fast paced and easy to learn from but difficult to master while being great fun.The game possess an art style which is similar to the one used in the Pixar film 'The Incredibles' but take note, it is not for kids. Gore and gibbing are the manner of the day but the violence is cartoony. The game is not also a system hog as you would expect it to be due to the fact it runs off the Source engine which powers the Half-Life 2 game and its' expansions.The sounds within the game is also top-notch. The characters voice-overs bring an overall sillness which is sorely needed in multiplayer games today. The weapons sounds are perfect and never distract from gameplay. Watch out for the hilarious announcer on the Goldrush stage. Though there is a occasional annoying sound bug.Hopefully valve will patch this.Team Fortess sports a simple control scheme which are in many First Person Shooters today and doesn't require a steep learning curve. Players will need to know about each class particular nuance such as the rocket jump for the Soldier and stickie jump the Demoman. These are easily learned by the seeing other players use the techniques.Now the gameplay, which is outstanding to say the least. There are a total 9 classes within the game. They are subdivided into offensive, defensive and support categories. Most are well balanced and enjoyable to play.You can have fun as a Soldier instantly gibbing people, have fun perfecting the art of camping by playing Engineer, mow down people with heavy, snipe people (which will make them hate you) as a Sniper. This fun applies to the other classes too.The maps also provide a lot of fun too, my favourite is dustbowl which sports a attack/defend style where the attacking side has to capture contol points and defending side has to, well, defend these points. Team Fortess also has Capture-the-Flag and control point capture. The game has plenty of maps with additonal maps being released by Valve through downloadable content.To get the most fun out it make sure you work with a team e.g a medic healing a heavy to make a unstoppable force with the medic using his healing gun which can make teammates immune to damage. There are many combinations to make. The game has a fantastic online community with quality severs out there.With Valve continuing to release further content by way of new maps, new weapons tied to achievements and patches which increase balance, as well as the game making full use of the Steam Friends functionality, Team Fortess will be around for a very long time.\\xa0\",\n",

       "  'description': 'The devil may cry franchise is one of big players in video game industry due to part of fast pace hack and slash gameplay. The original Devil May Cry came out in 2001 and is often held as one of the best action adventure game ever made, but the series has been though many up and downs; thankfully Devil May Cry 4 manages to deliver a great experience and is one of the best in the series. The biggest problem with the Devil May Cry franchise is the difficulty, capcom never seem to have gotten right DMC2 was way to easy while DMC3 was way too hard so much so that capcom had to re-released it. But capcom really did its homework with DMC4, for starters there are two difficulties to choose from in the beginning Human (easy) and Devil Hunter (Normal), the human difficulty is obviously targeted towards newcomers while Devil Hunter is for veterans, furthermore there is a tutorial in the first level of the game which teach new comers the basics of the Devil May Cry 4 combat system. Veterans of the series will quickly notice the new protagonist Nero he seems like a character that was made to carter newcomers as his moves aren\\'t as deep or complex as Dante\\'s. In Nero\\'s arsenal are his Blue Rose a Duel Barrel Revolver \"Dirty Harry eat your heart out\", the Red Queen a large sword with a motorcycle handle which allows players to charge there sword for faster and stronger attacks or exceed which is what the game calls it and finally the Devil Bringer a demonic arm that allows Nero to do busters which means he picks up enemy\\'s and slams them into the floor and he even says \"Slam-dunk\" and the second ability allows Nero to stretch out his arm to reach certain platforms or even grab enemies a\\'la Bionic Commando style. Half way though the game you well get to play as Dante and this is where Devil May Cry 4 gets really fun as Dante plays more fluid than Nero. Dante gameplay mechanics is very similar to DMC3 except for one big change and that is that he can now switch Styles on the fly which really opens up the combo system and allows for a lot of crazy things to happen. Dante four styles are the same as DMC3 you get Trickster, Swordmaster, Gunslinger, and Royal Guard you get pretty much the idea by there name. Graphically Devil May Cry 4 looks amazing, character animation and models look superb and the level design is diverse. On the sound department Devil May Cry 4 retains its heavy metal soundtrack and it\\'s probably the best one in the series. Devil May Cry 4 length will average around 7 hours to complete but you can go back to find secrets and carry over your powered character into the many difficulties in the game, adding to the replay value is achievements and online leaderboards this adds a lot to the game as you can compare scores with your friends online. Devil May Cry 4 is one of this years best action/adventure game and if you have either a PS3 or 360 and are in the market for an action/adventure game this is it.',\n",

       "  'description': 'For those of you who have never heard of MOO2, it is a game where you play the emperor of a space empire that starts small and you have to build it and defend your worlds, and become the greatest empire in the galaxy. However unlike some games, it’s not needlessly complicated. It all starts with the race selection screen where you can choose to do what you like, pick a race based on your play style…or create your own race (a feature I much prefer). Hidden under the visual facade of the 16 bit graphics is a really well built ecosystem/economic system. The AI battles with each other, sometimes your blamed for the actions of other races in a very under the table spies and cloak and dagger kind of way. It’s turn-based, each turn is about 10 years, allowing enough time for you to justify a planet being able to develop without it seeming a little daft. The graphics are beautiful in their design, compared to todays standards they’re rubbish, but really well drawn and your scientists move in a two frame animation, which I always find quite funny. The thing that makes this game great is game play, for a space-strat-sim it’s got something for everyone: Science, a very deep research tree with benefits that actually have an impact when you get them. You can beat the game using science and your mind instead of brute force. Terraforming, Genetic manipulation, Chemical weapons, Mass-destruction or BFGs that would make doom pee itself. The micromanaging of planets is fantastic, certain buildings will give you bonuses and certain races will have innate benefits you can take advantage of. You divvy out your possible working masses on each planet in to three piles: 1: Farmers 2: Workers 3 Scientists A simple system that really makes it easy to get on with running the galaxy at large. Building, buildings that benefit your people anything from theatres to hospitals can be built and most of them have upgrades; every little helps. You are able to customize ships, the way they look, what the fire power is even what kind of soldiers are onboard. The ship builder is detailed, fun and easy to use, build the kind of ship you want, make ‘Deathstars’ that can destroy an entire planet, (but be warned destroying entire planets can really piss of those bugeyed ETs) All ships have there place in the game, with the Deathstars (correctly equipped) being the be all and end all. Fight, blow planets up (really cool animation for this), attack ships, take over planets and enslave the people, bombard planets and start afresh with your own people. Genocide is, at least in MOO2, kind of cool. The fight system is based on a grid in a 2D plane, the space version is really fun to use, cool animations, little missile that takes a few turns to reach your target it’s all about tactics and tactics are rewarded (which is always nice) . There is a ‘calculate battle’ button, which when your going through the universe taking over each system, ironically systematically, is really useful. The planetside version of this I will get to in a minute. Peace is an option, you could always just make peace with everyone and become head of the council, thus winning. I really like that this was an option truly a open-minded game indeed. Really at odds with when it was made. This game still has a great online community, even to this day. It’s great fun if you have a home LAN network; even if you don’t there is a hot seating mode. One computer can equal loads of fun.  It is really hard to say what I DON’T like about MOO2 because I love it so much. But, nothing is perfect (except maybe me). Most of the time your in for the long haul, and sometimes the AI creates a cascade of events which means that you are alone against an intergalactic superpower. Which as you can probably imagine is really annoying. The planetside battles are really badly designed, it’s nothing like the space combat and you have no control over the battles. It’s all automated and often you watch your simple townsfolk in there own 16bit world, with there little poking sticks; getting beaten from afar by aliens in suits with big guns. This is really frustrating, especially when your spaceships are far out powering theirs. Who cares who can benchpress more, when you have a gun that can blow up a planet? The diplomatic relations AI is a bit rubbish. And stupid.  Ask it something enough and you’ll find it’ll do one of two things: 1. Do what you ask. 2. Declare War. Now when all you’ve been asking is for sub-terrainian farm technology you start to ask yourself ‘why?‘. Which is almost unforgivable until your beating them to death with there own flux-capacitor and they are begging for peace and offering up there own mother to placate you. This is however a really nice moment. One thing that really really got on my nerves was the Antares, aliens from another dimension that would randomly attack random systems and decimate the planet and then fly back to their own home world (going to there dimension and killing them is a way of beating the game -not an easy feat I can tell you), if they happen to be attacking a system your just developing and it’s not protected by your entire fleet you might as well give that planet up because it’s back to the drawing board. This is a really annoying game mechanic that punishes those you don’t get the fast engine tech early. Which is mean because I think that food is more important on developing worlds because rocket fuel doesn’t feed babies. At least not yet….. The Bottom Line... Master of Orion 2 is at the end of it a game that has never left my hard drive, something which I’ve always thought as an achievement for a good game. MOO2 is a game I still play, I still enjoy and occasionally brings me something new that I never expected, something that is missing from the games of today. This is a game for the ages, if you don’t own it already; you’re mad. 4.5/5 and that includes the kitchen sink and a slightly blood stained Flux-capacitor.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Bizarre Creations have come up with yet another graphical showcase on Microsoft’s console. Hours and hours of footage and hundreds of pictures made it possible for them to create photo-realistic vehicles and environments. The game features 80 licensed supercars and the environments span over Tokyo, New York, London, Las Vegas and Nürburgring. The soundtrack features songs from genres like Hip Hop, J-Pop and even Classical. There’s the online play you could find in PGR 2 and even an online career. The off-line Career includes 23 different championships, with many of the modes you’ve come to know from previous PGR titles. Cone Challenge, Overtake, Speed Camera and new modes like Breakthrough (timed checkpoint races, similar to Tollbooth races in Need For Speed Most Wanted), Drift Challenge (earn enough Kudos by drifting in a very limited amount of time) and Time VS Kudos (racking up Kudos stops the timer) challenge your racing style, how well you handle oversteering and so on.  However, when comparing these numbers to that of PGR 2, you’ll find these numbers are far from an improvement. They’re actually a step back from the 100+ vehicles, 100+ tracks and huge off-line career found in PGR 2. The soundtrack is also significantly shorter than the 200 songs found in PGR 2 and there are no radio stations.  Then what makes this game worthwhile, you ask. Well, it’s that this game oozes of quality, and it does feel like you are driving these supercars in real life. 80 cars seem like a small amount, but every car is high-end, and in the beginning you get to choose between cars like Ultima GTR (my pick) and Chevrolet Corvette C6. There are also some impressive concept cars, and car enthusiasts will be positively surprised to see cars like Nissan GTR Proto, Ford Mustang GT-R and the Ferrari F430.   There’s also the new cockpit camera. In this view, you’ll se your motion-captured hands work the steering wheel and gear, and (if you’re using a car where you can see this) you’re feet working the brakes and throttle. It’s all really realistic, and you’ll see any buttons or screens you would see if you were driving the cars. There are also realistic shadows and you’ll see the dirt or any damage on the front window. You can use the right thumbstick to look around in the cockpit and look in the mirrors, as the regular rearview mirror is removed in this view. The mirrors are realistic too, but the draw distance is much lower. The camera shakes and you’ll see how the G-forces affect your view, which makes it very intense at times. Some of the tracks are bumpy and fast, and in cooperation with the cockpit camera makes for a great sense of realism. If only there were any steering wheels available for the Xbox 360 yet…  The sense of realism is greater enhanced with the authentic engine sounds. You’ll definitely hear the difference between a Ferrari F50 GT and a Shelby GT500, and the sounds change according to which camera you’re using.  The cars also handle different. Not necessarily realistic (you’re brakes don’t lock up, for instance), but it definitely feels as it.  Your cars get damaged and scraped, but not necessarily realistically… The damage is only cosmetic, though.  The online play is also good. There’s very little lag, except for some rare occasions where your opponent will disappear and re-appear or bounce a little. There’s a great chance of hurting your rep, as other gamers will mistake competitiveness for anger, but I’m guessing it’s not the game’s fault. There’s a cool Gotham TV, where you can see the best of the best or your friends in action, just like if you were watching a replay of yourself. The online career is pretty much like a set series of sessions, and is a good place to make cash and Kudos. It is pretty short, though, and it would be nice with more events based on the lesser classes. It will probably be updated though, and the same goes for new content like cars and tracks. The car classes includes D, C, B and A. A is the highest-end, with cars like McLaren F1 LM, and D is the lowest, with cars like Ferrari 355 GTS.  As you make money you can buy cars. I know, pretty obvious... However, there’s no system that limits you from buying the best cars early in the career. You never win new cars to buy or own, except for 10 of them who are unlocked by reaching Ranks by getting enough Kudos. If you keep your starter car, which is definitely possible as the game seem to change your opponents according to your own car, and rack up 1 200 000 Credits you can buy ANY car available. The problem is, almost all of them are available, even top cars like Lamborghini Muciélago R-GT and McLaren F1 LM.  When buying your car, you can choose to view cars from a specific manufacturer, cars priced under 100 000, cars in the 100 000 – 200 000 price range, cars priced over 200 000 or cars that you can afford. After your selection, a list of cars will show up. By using the triggers you can sort by name, price or performance. When browsing the list of cars, you’ll see stats like Horsepowers, Torque, Top Speed and Drivetrain as well as meters displaying Drifting, Top Speed, Acceleration, Braking and Grip. You’ll also see Gotham Sport Comments next to the car. The comments describe how well it drives, how easy it is on the player and some facts regarding its history. This can be helpful because when the game sort cars after performance, they don’t put into consideration how easy the cars are on the player, like oversteering and overpowering. When you buy a vehicle, you have to choose one color for it; the color cannot be changed without buying the same vehicle again. As you get more cars you’ll also get new garages. These are all photo-realistic, and a nice feature lets you walk around your garage and see how the sunlight hits your car. This really shows off what a graphical wonder it is, and how it’s more than you would expect from a launch title. You can also move cars around garages if you like sorting your cars, or move specific cars in or out of the sunlight. There's also two arcade machines in every garage, one with Geometry Wars (from PGR 2) and one with a trial version of Geometry Wars 2  Another nice feature is the new Photo Mode. Photo Mode lets you take your own screenshots when watching a replay, viewing your garage(s) or in a race. In Photo Mode you can walk around and really take a closer look at objects and environments. By doing this I’ve found hidden pictures of what I believe are the guys that made the game, seen old cabs parked between buildings and more. The cheering crowds and some of the objects aren’t that graphically impressive when up close, but you won’t notice it when doing turns at 150 MPH, especially not with the game’s gorgeous motion blurring.  Yet another new feature is the Route Creator. There you can make your own checkpoints and do as the title says: create routes. The Creator is limited though, and the walls made by the Creator are harder to see and often badly positioned.  There’s a series of badges you can earn in the game, as well as Xbox 360 Achievements. The Xbox 360 Achievements includes reaching Rank 5, Rank 1, owning every Lamborghini in the game, owning every Ferrari in the game and completing the off-line Career mode in Steel, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. The Badges includes having a car collection worth 1 million, earning your first Platinum medal and buying every car in the game. There seems to be a problem with the “Own Every Car” Badge, as I own every car, but I haven’t gotten it. I’ve checked for missing cars or duplicate cars several times, but I truly have every car. It would be nice with an option to only show cars you don’t own, as spending money on a car and then finding out you already owned one is a real pain in the you-know-what….  The latest in the PGR series yet again show off impressive graphics, but it does fall short on length. The Medal system (Steel, Bronze, Silver, etc) helps give the game replay value, and you rarely use the same track more than once. The authenticity shines through, and makes you want to experience the intense racing over and over again. It’s also every car enthusiast’s dream, thanks to many concepts cars that’s never been in any game before. Racing fans have to be crazy to sit this one out!\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Gameplay: 9/10GTA IV\\'s gameplay is basically much the same as previous GTA games. You can run around an open world jacking cars and killing randoms. But like previous GTA games there are also street races and many other mini games. There may not be as many mini games as they had in GTA San Andreas but there a lot smoother now and they actually have a purpose. The game also brings life to old a stale features and adds an extra realistic detail which makes it feel like your playing GTA 3 for the first time again.The driving in GTA games has always been fun. Whether it\\'s the sliding around corners or really getting that sense of speed, it was always just plain fun and only sometimes annoying. But with GTA IV comes a real learning curve. The car physics have been redone making the car control seem more real and more fake at the same time, it\\'s a good balance. You\\'ll still slide around corners like a madman but if you drive that way you\\'ll end up smashing into the sides of a lot of buildings. You also won\\'t feel the same sense of speed that you\\'re used to even when you\\'re a sports car like the Infernus. But those are just small annoyances when you consider how fun it can be learning to drive with the new car physics, at first it\\'s hard but you\\'ll soon realise that you have to break on every corner and then it will feel natural. Anyway, if you don\\'t like the new driving you can always catch one of the many taxis roaming the streets of Liberty City. Which is one of GTA IV\\'s new features and trust me your going to want to catch a taxi sooner or later, the ease of just hailing a taxi, holding the Y button to jump in and then letting the taxi driver do all the work for you. Or you may prefer to skip the trip all together for a little extra cost, but I do highly recommend listening to the hilarious dialogue of the taxi drivers. A little feature Rockstar also added was that you can no longer just open a parked car and drive away you\\'ll now have to watch a short animation of Niko breaking the windscreen and hotwiring the car before you can drive away.The aiming systems in previous games have been highly criticized for being clunky and very simplistic. Each game has slightly improved on the lasts aiming system but this isn\\'t the case with GTA IV. The aiming system has gone under a complete over-haul which was much needed. You can still choose to lock-on or free aim at your target but you\\'ll want to lock-on to your target because of being able to choose which part of the body you want to shoot at. This feature adds a lot of strategy to shoot-outs; with a flick of the analog stick you can take aim at an opponents head for an instant kill. Or if you\\'re getting attacked by an enemy on a ledge you can take a shot at his legs making him fall to his death. Another feature that increases strategy in shoot-outs is the new cover system. Just like Gears of War if you don\\'t take cover you will die... quickly. It was a smart move to add cover to GTA. In the old games shoot-outs were very unrealistic because you could run into a room full of twenty plus enemies and come out with barely a dent in your health meter. Alas the cover system has some flaws, like the old aiming system it is very clunky. The only real complaint one can have about the shooting in GTA IV is the extreme lack of guns. In total there are only 15 different weapons to have in your arsenal and the more destructive ones like the Rocket Launcher can be really pricey.Friendships were subtly introduced in GTA San Andreas in the form of Girlfriends. In GTA IV they are a vital part of the game. Most friends you will meet during the games main storyline but you can also meet some male and female friends over the internet dating site love-meet.com. Each relationship will have its own benefit, whether it be a taxi service or dial-a-bomb they all add something new to the gameplay giving you an incentive to go out with them. To make your friends like you more you can call them or they can call you to arrange a game of bowling, darts, pool or even a little bit of drinking. The drinking will especially have some fun implications. You may also like to see a show with them, you could watch the cabaret or go to a comedy club and listen to well known comedians Ricky Gervais and Kat Williams.The internet makes its debut in GTA IV in the form of internet cafes called tw@t (which we\\'re actually in GTA 3 just not accessible). The internet offers over 100 pages of content which is all in its own way hilarious. Whether you\\'re looking for dates, a new car or even hacking into the police database there will always be something for you to do on the internet. You can also receive e-mails form family members back in Russia giving a little bit of back story to Niko before he came to Liberty City. Some side missions can also be received via e-mail.The side missions are much the same as they have always been. You have street races, vigilante missions, taxi jobs, deliveries, stunt jumping and hidden package collecting. And the addition of most wanted missions which along with vigilante missions are accessed through the use of a police computer. You may be thinking but wait, there was more in old GTA\\'s and yes you are correct. There are no ambulance and fire truck missions. Which isn\\'t a big loss as they where boring.GTA IV has fewer mini games than GTA San Andreas. Which like the side missions is not a big deal. The mini games that they have left in are now just better and actually have a purpose. The mini games include pool, darts, bowling, Cubed and drunk driving. The drunk driving is extremely fun to do because it actually makes you feel like your walking around the streets tumbling off the curb and driving a car into lamp posts. After a while you can sometimes find yourself feeling a little dizzy just from watching the blurry screen swirl around. Pool is nearly an exact replica of the San Andreas version and darts is just too easy. Cubed is an interesting take on tetris which if you play too much you may just become addicted to it. The worst mini game of the lot would have to be bowling. The pin physics are horrible. What would be a perfect strike in real life would result in maybe five or six pins falling down. It\\'s completely random if you get a strike or not. This is easily the worst mini game GTA has seen.GTA IV\\'s gameplay delivers everything you would expect from a GTA game. Stealing cars, shooting people and roaming around a city and doing what you like when you like. Which is a lot more than any normal person would need. It is only slightly let down by a few things that could have done with a bit of polishing like the cover system and bowling mini game. It\\'s missing a few things from old GTA games that were never that great so it\\'s really no big loss.STORY: 10/10Past GTA games have had stories that were never quite \\'there\\'. For example GTA San Andreas had a long story, longer than GTA IV, but 60% of the game was irrelevant to the story. Where GTA IV\\'s story (which is about 90 missions long) is constant the whole way through.The main reason GTA IV\\'s story succeeds is the main character. This time around you fill the shoes of a Russian immigrant who is just arriving in Liberty City because his cousin lied to him about living the \\'American Dream\\' with many women. But as the story progresses you\\'ll learn that he is also trying to escape from his past. To quote him, he\\'s killed people, smuggled people and sold people. His name is Nikolai \\'Niko\\' Bellic and he is the most three dimensional character the series has ever seen. Unlike the old characters he\\'s not a yes-man. Instead of doing everything he\\'s told like a good boy he questions his employers motives and makes them give him a reason to do there dirty deeds. Hell at some points in the game you\\'re given the opportunity to spare your targets life for your own benefits. It\\'s moments like these you realise that Niko Bellic is no ordinary video game character. Oh, and lets not forget, Niko is a cold-blooded badass with no morals.Now you try tell me he isn\\'t appealing to you.The secondary characters in the game are varied and interesting. You have your comedic characters that you love, and the tough mob bosses that treat you like crap which you can\\'t help but hate. Having these interesting characters draws you into the story of the game in new ways. You\\'re no longer playing through the story to unlock everything you need to cause destruction, your playing through to see how the characters evolve around you.As I briefly mentioned previously, at certain points in the game allow for you to choose what you want to do. I\\'m not going to go into to much depth but at certain points of the game you can choose to kill your target or go after your employer, each option will have its benefits in the long run like earning houses and bonus outfits. You may even get a different ending. This helps the player immerse themselves into the story of the game.GTA IV\\'s story is one of the best I\\'ve seen in a videogame. It has dynamic characters that evolve over the progress of the game. Rockstar have given us the chance to change the story by making our own choices during the game which can result in two different endings. Few games can boast a story to be better than that of GTA IV.SOUND: 10/10Sound has always been one of the GTA series strong points. There amazing dialogue, diverse radio stations and the sounds of the city are top-notch, and this GTA IV is no different.The dialogue in GTA IV has been called Oscar worthy. That may be a slight exaggeration but without a doubt the dialogue is excellent. Rockstar has done things a little bit differently this time around, instead of hiring big Hollywood stars like Samuel .L. Jackson and James Woods to do voice over work they\\'ve essentially hired a bunch of nobodies. This helps make the game more realistic because you\\'re not relating characters to there voice actors. You have no choice but to let the character tell you who they are, giving more depth to the characters and story.The radio stations in GTA games have always been diverse and besides a few exceptions, hilarious. Like always there are talk stations, hip hop and rap stations, funk stations and rock stations. But what makes GTA\\'s stations special is that even stations with the same genre of music have a unique flavor. The music of GTA IV consists of licensed music from names like The Smashing Pumpkins, Queen, Kanye West and there\\'s pretty much a whole radio station dedicated to the legendary Bob Marley. GTA IV\\'s soundtrack also consists of music written specifically for the game that fits seamlessly with the feel of the game. Rockstar has also bought back the fan favorite radio DJ Lazlow.\"Get moving you jack***!\" \"Get out of my way you **** face!\". Ahhhhh the serenading words of your fellow Libertonians... yeh not quite. While your walking through the streets you\\'ll be treated to sounds of pedestrians conversations, engines failing, metal clashing against metal, an inconsiderate ped drive by with his radio booming and occasionally a gun shot or a ear shattering explosion. These improved sounds really makes it feel like your there during that gun fight or when your speeding down the \\'Booth Tunnel\\' at a 100 mph.The sounds of GTA IV are extraordinary. The dialogue is movie-like; the radio stations are as good as ever, and you can really tell the difference between firing a pistol or firing a shot gun. Everything just sounds, right. It\\'s things like these that make GTA IV what it is.GRAPHICS: 10/10The first thing you will notice about GTA IV is the graphics, they are technically outstanding. They may not be the most photo realistic graphics you\\'ve ever seen but if you take into account the sheer size of the redesigned Liberty City and how much is always going on you should realise that GTA IV\\'s graphics are a technical masterpiece.\\xa0Even when your just taking a stroll through the streets of Liberty City you\\'ll notice how much effort Rockstar North has put into getting the animations right this time around. The animations in previous games were at best sub-par. GTA IV ends the tradition of clunky animations through the use of the Euphoria game engine. Niko\\'s motions are now fluent and well choreographed, adding to overall realism. For example if Niko were to turn left while running his body will tilt left. The sharper he turns the more he tilts.It\\'s clear that Rockstar has also worked on improving pedestrian looks and behaviours. You will rarely see two pedestrians which are identical, contrary to previous GTA games where in area with 10 pedestrians in it 3 of them would look exactly the same. The peds actions have also been improved, instead of walking around aimlessly they will read the paper, tie their shoes and even enter and exit buildings on their own accord. The improvements to the peds really helps sink in the fact that Liberty City is now a living, breathing world not just a bunch of pixels shaped into a city.Like all games in the open world genre the frame rate isn\\'t perfect which is understandable considering the game\\'s size. But what makes this game better than the rest is its frame rate issues are minor and barely noticeable. In 3 hours of straight game play I only noticed it play up twice, compared to the GTA games of old where you would see a car pop-in every two minutes.Although GTA IV\\'s graphics aren\\'t the most photo realistic we\\'ve ever seen they are truly astonishing to look at. You could spend a whole session of playing just walking the streets being amazed by how Rockstar succeeded in creating a living, breathing city.VALUE: 5/5Do I think GTA IV is worth buying? Yes. I was asked about a week ago if I would buy GTA IV if they were selling it for $300. My answer was yes. GTA IV is jam packed with content which will keep me busy for months. And that\\'s not even starting to think about the DLC that they will be bringing out. If you buy one game this year make it this one. You could call it game of the year, or you could call it the game of the decade. But what it should be called is the best game ever, period. For every bad thing in GTA IV there are 50 good things. This game is so full of content that 80% of people will never experience it all. It may be a while before you see a game that tops this one.TILT: 5/5Grand Theft Auto IV in one word......

       " {'deck': 'Sam Fisher is back for the fourth time',\n",
       "  'description': 'Ubisoft\\'s fourth entry in the Splinter Cell franchise proves that there\\'s still life in the old guy. The Splinter Cell franchise remains robust and satisfying, but some changes have been made for the worse.  As you begin playing you\\'ll notice three options. These are introduced by the voice of a woman, which is a first in the series. Special Features is nothing special (Credits and the E3 Trailer for Rainbow Six Vegas), but the other two, Single Player and Multiplayer, are definitely noteworthy.  The Singleplayer menu is presented with good old green. It\\'s basically just different shades of green, some fancy character animations and environment fly-bys that works as pointers to what you can expect later in the game. The thing I noticed first was the option called TRAINING. I hopped into that one first, and was greeted to an interesting video while the game was loading. It had no sound, but you saw Sam Fisher waking up in a bed behind guarded doors. This could mean many things, but it has later proven to really mean nothing. The training level seems more like a \"dream level\", so maybe he just had a dream while being tested or something. When the training begins, a female voice tells you what you need to do. The level is whiter than Michael Jackson, and everything shines with a marvelous glow. Your \"mission\" is to reach a photo of your late daughter Sarah. Some camera jamming and rappelling from a pipe later, not to mention an Achievement worth 10 points, you\\'ll get to Part B of the Training. Here it\\'s a little more interesting, and there\\'ll actually be humans involved. There\\'s a hostage situation at large, but with only three people to worry about. This is the training level after all. You\\'ll finish this quickly, and get another 40 gamerscore points. The training level wasn\\'t just good for the achievements though. I for one loved the clean colors!  Training is fun and all that, but what about actually getting into some Double Agent singleplayer action??? Well, Double Agent features pretty much the same gameplay as in Chaos Theory, but (as should be expected) with some additions. The animations are very fluid, sneaking around is enjoyable, graphics are great and the AI is clever. On the very first mission, which takes place in Iceland, you begin underwater. It\\'s not much underwater action in this level, but another level, which takes you to a Lost Planet-like environment, features a lot more swimming underground. A new way of taking out enemies is by braking the ice underneath the enemy and pulling him under, followed by stabbing him in the chest. This is awesome, just like snapping people while hanging in a pipe was in Chaos Theory. However, there\\'s just not enough opportunities to do this. You can do the trick maybe 3-4 times. One of the new moves introduced in Chaos Theory, the ability to jump up and pull the enemy under while shimmying, can be done maybe 4 times. The manual says that you can split jump and do the neck split while holding on a pipe, but I played through the whole singleplayer game without even having the chance of doing this. Seems as Ubisoft didn\\'t feel the urge to show off Sam\\'s array of moves as much as in previous Splinter Cell games. A new move I really love is the ability to attack an enemy about to bypass the wall you\\'re leaning against. A symbol will appear, and pressing A will make Sam chop the unsuspecting enemies throat, throw the enemy into the wall and get him into a hold. The hold is the same as in Chaos Theory, where Sam press his army knife against the enemy\\'s throat (Sam held his pistol against the enemy\\'s head in the first two games) and holds up the enemy\\'s right hand. If you\\'re leaning into a wall where throwing someone into it is not suitable, like an oddly shaped or too short wall, Sam will throw his enemy on the ground, with Sam on top. This is not the beginning of a freaky sex scene, but a brand new hold. Sure, Sam can\\'t move, but it\\'s cool to see the enemy\\'s neck being pushed to the limit by Sam\\'s bicep... Sam might be 50 years old by now, but shows no signs of getting sloppy. It\\'s also fun too look at Sam as he interrogates the enemy. As always, some of the enemies actually know something, whether it\\'s security codes ( these can also be found in computers or simply hacked), the location of an objective or whatever reason they have to work for the bad guys.  I\\'m the kind of player that wants to go through the game unspotted, and without having to kill anyone. The thought of eliminating unsuspecting guards, and them living to know it, appeals to me. If you\\'re NOT like me, you can easily go on a killing spree. This will usually get the NSA pissed off, not to mention lower the scores you get after each level, like in Chaos Theory. There are some times you\\'re forced to kill in order to defend yourself, however. On the other hand, you have a lot of non-lethal gadgets on your disposal, like gas and stun grenades, flash wall mines and the numerous add-ons for the SC20K. SC20K is the silenced machine gun rifle Sam uses. The rifle hasn\\'t changed much. The scope is different, with a smaller scope that only display a laser spot as crosshair. A nice touch is how the scope is away from Sam\\'s eye, and you\\'ll be more aware of your surroundings as you try and nail that headshot. A bigger change however, is the compatibility with different gadgets. You have the familiar Sticky Shocker (launchable tazer) and Air Ringfold Round (launchable object that knocks the target out for a couple of seconds), but also new gadgets like the Shotgun extension, several grenades, Sticky Cam (the Sticky Cam has the same functions as the old Diversion Cam, with the added function of blowing the sucker up) and more. As you can see, Sam has a lot of gadgets. These can be unlocked by doing some of the secondary objectives. These are usually of the reach-objective-without-any-alerts. Sam himself, however, also has a a lot of moves. You\\'ll be climbing up pipes, going through little holes and interacting with machines. The level designs are great as always, with several different environments. Strangely, though, the focus seems to have been shifted from darkness to more of a lit up environment. There\\'s actually a lot less cases where you need to use any of the goggle visions. This is probably why the sound and light meters have been cut In stead, you\\'ll only have three colored dots. Green means your in a dark environment and safe from spotting, unless you start jumping around, yellow means your lit up and might be spotted and red means you\\'ve been spotted. Graphics-vise, Double Agent doesn\\'t disappoint. Some of the environments are spectacular and the graphics hold the standard. However, it doesn\\'t exceed them like the previous games did. If you liked how the rain dropped on Sam in his leather suit as he was creeping in almost complete darkness, you might get a little disappointed in Double Agent. The graphics are showed off in other ways however, very nice sun effects and realistic water. I missed the emphasis on shadows the previous game shad, though.  Sound disappoints a little. The voicework is good, but the voices are too low compared to the rest of the game, and there\\'s no subtitles. You\\'ll turn up the TV, but then turn it down the minute someone starts firing a weapon. The soundtrack is nice, but not the best in the series.  Double Agent is called Double Agent for a reason. Sam is infiltrating a terrorist group, the JBA, to stop them from destroying parts of the U.S. The terrorists are U.S., but are under the impression that the country is run by the wrong guys. This isn\\'t really original whatsoever, but there\\'s some interesting new features. Notably, the Trust system. As a Double Agent, you have to please both the NSA and the JBA, but sometimes the two contradicts each other. You\\'ll have to make some important choices, but not really enough. There\\'s maybe 5 of these choices through the entire game. At the end of the game, I had the feeling that the game wasn\\'t as big as the previous game\\'s, but as I started playing the game again on Hard, I liked it even more. The game isn\\'t shorter than previous Splinter Cell games, but not really longer either. The presentation is at its best at the beginning, with some impressive CGI. The later cutscenes are not CG, but with mo-capped in-game animations.  Multiplayer is also an enjoyable feature. The standard match allows a maximum of six players; three guards and three spies. The spies are pretty much young versions of Sam. They move a lot faster and have some crazy athletic moves. They have a device on their forearms that sends out signals that will break glass, interrupt the guards\\' weapon systems and destroy lights. The guards are controlled in first-person (unlike the spies and Sam who are controlled in third-person) and have a big-ass weapon with unlimited ammo and grenade launcher. On every map, there\\'s four color-coded computers. The Spies\\' goal is to download a file from one of the computers with the forearm-device and return to the starting point. The guards goal is of course to stop the spies. Downloading the files take a lot of time, especially when you\\'re pushing the 10 feet connection limit, but you can stop and continue the download. Although a guard is not to mess with, it seems to me like the spies are superior. The maps are laid out so that spies have a lot of room to move where the guards can\\'t. Pretty much the only athletical moves the guards have is jumping and lowering down from heights with ropes. The spies are also extremely fast, and they tend to have enough life to avoid encounters. Guards also don\\'t have the motion detector anymore either.There\\'s other things to do in the multiplayer, however. There\\'s the coop challenges, where you can play with a group of people to achieve more specific objectives. Unfortunately, there\\'s no longer the more intimate coop that was featured in Chaos Theory. It\\'s more about competing than working together, and there\\'s no specific coop levels. There\\'s also a big bonus system, with stuff like new skins and videos.  Double Agent is an entry in the series that\\'s highly enjoyable, yet some changes have been made for the worse. I loved the light and sound meters and co-op gameplay in Chaos Theory, but this have been altered for the worse. The game is also a lot less about darkness, and this is also where it might disappoint. Only fans that have played the whole series will recognize them, however, and newbies can easily get into it. Splinter Cell remains a lot of fun for people who wants to infiltrate and eliminate.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Level 5 brings a superb adventure of space piracy and saving the galaxy in their latest title, Rogue Galaxy. Though the game is very traditional, as far as RPG\\'s go, it doesn\\'t follow the Japanese style per say, trading that in for the Star Ocean style instead. In fact you will notice quite a few similarities with this title and Star Ocean III. Luckily for all involved, Star Ocean was a fantastic game and this one is just as good if not a little better. Level 5 proves that you don\\'t have to be a big hitter the likes of Square to put out a quality role-playing game. With a mix of great implementation through gameplay and an engaging, all be it a bit predictable, storyline, rolled up in a beautiful package. Rogue Galaxy proves to be a great game to play and you will not miss those 40+ hours you sink into it.The game follows Jaster Rogue, a small town boy who has no idea who he really is or for what purpose he is destined to fulfill. Sound familiar? It should, it has been the premise for many an RPG. Anyways, there is a war going on throughout the galaxy and up until recently Jaster\\'s home world of Rosa has been able to stay out of it. Nevertheless, now that the inhabitance has been enslaved by the evil military faction, Jaster vows to leave and fight to end the war and free his little planet. After a case of mistaken identity, he is able to join a crew of space \"pirates\" (term used very loosely). One thing leads to another and eventually you find out that there is way more going on then just a simply conflict and of course Jaster is the key to it all. Even though three-quarters of this is simply recycled ideas from past RPG\\'s, they obviously please the audience or they wouldn\\'t be lasting this long. The story is well written and it sucks you in to the point where you really want to find out what the deal is with Jaster and his friends. Plus in true fashion, the ending is something to see including the very involved final boss battle(s).Another aspect that is well implemented is the game\\'s active action battle system. Much like Enix\\'s work in Star Ocean, when a battle occurs, players are free to roam around a small battle area and attack in a hack and slash way. Along with a standard attack combo and a side weapon, characters also have abilities they can use to either enhance an attribute of one or all of the party, or cause damage to one or all of the foes in the battle. Item usage, weapon change, and switching characters pretty much round out the standards that make up an RPG. Anyone who was a fan of this style of battle system will not be disappointed here, it proves to be quite satisfying all the while still maintaining a good solid feeling.Along with a well-written story and a solid battle system, the game itself just looks great. The planets are beautiful, the beasts are well drawn, the characters are great, and the towns and scenery are just fantastic. The visuals really are stunning for a work of PS2 caliber and you would be daft not to appreciate good artistic work when you see it. Along with all the in game graphics, the cut scenes are simply breathtaking. They do a fantastic job of mixing look and feel and you will wish that there were more of them to see. What could be better then a good looking game? How bout seeing it all with no load times? That\\'s right, aside from the initial loading of the game you get to see all these great visuals load-free. Everything from blooming light effects to excellent use of shadows give the game a great presentationOf course presentation isn\\'t everything. What would any good RPG be with out a system for learning abilities? Rogue Galaxy fills this requirement with a Revelation Chart for each character. Through filling this chart, the character will learn new abilities as well as increase his or her HP, elemental defense, and AP efficiency. Basically it works like this, each time you win a battle you stand a chance of getting some weird useless item. Coffee beans or an old sock are just a few examples. When you get enough of these items together, you can put them in a character\\'s revelation chart. When you fill a particular section, the character has a \"revelation\" and learns whatever was in that section. Once a section is filled it could also open up new sections to be filled. The game does a good job of scattering items through out the game and you wont be able to completely fill anyone\\'s chart until you get to the end of the game.With all of this you also get a plethora of stuff to do along with the game\\'s main story. This includes capturing, raising, training, breeding, and battling insects in the games mini-game. Every RPG has a mini-game and this one is pitting insects in blood hungry one on one combat. Luckily if that sounds completely too much like Pokemon for you, you don\\'t have to participate in it. You won\\'t be missing anything terribly interesting rest assured. Something that may be more worth your time however is the game\\'s optional boss battles. It might be worth mentioning at this point that there is a list of the top 100 bounty hunters. You get points for defeating a certain number of beasts or defeating optional bosses. Jaster starts out at the very bottom of this list and, of course, there are many benefits for making all the way to the top slot. Taking on these optional bosses is crucial in claiming the top spot and they really aren\\'t that difficult either. The game also boasts a weapon synthesis system along with an item synthesis system both of which have the ability to take up butt loads of time if you are so inclined as to dabble in them. Luckily these too are optional and will not hinder you from enjoying the story.Much like all good RPG\\'s, this one is not without its share of faults. The first and foremost of these problems is the games harsh difficulty level. The battles start out hard and frequent \"game over\" screens are to be expected along with many, many potions and resurrections. Unfortunately coupled with that is the game\\'s lack of good training areas in the beginning and you never really get much of a chance until you are a bit into the game. A good analogy for the curve is like running as fast as you can into the side of a building. Once you climb the wall and get to the roof of that curve, the game levels out pretty well. This would prove to be a turn off to anyone who is not willing to spend the time to get to that point though. The story joins the difficulty in having a pretty slow start. There is a point where you are wondering if we are ever going to get to meaning behind it all. Luckily, much like Greg says in his review, that point is close in proximity to when things actually start happening. Some other notable flaws are the games score, which is pretty limp as far as RPG standards go, and the games use of roaming dialogue. As you are wandering around the various territories your three party members will speak their mind about whatever they feel like saying. This is incredibly annoying. At first the remarks about how long the player has been playing the game, and that they should probably save soon are a bit novel, but after a bit of that its just like, \"Just shut up already!\" Especially when they cycle through 4 or 5 different things and that\\'s all. Unfortunately for us, Level 5 did not implement a way to turn this off in the options menu.Anyone who is a fan of role-playing games will definitely have a good time with Rogue Galaxy. This title delivers on all fronts to give you an involved storyline, satisfying battles, hours of entertainment, all the while looking pretty damn good in the process. Sure the game slaps you in the face with its grueling difficulty, and rubs you the wrong way with the cycled roaming dialogue, but how many games are prefect these days? The faults don\\'t really draw to far from making this game a great bit of fun to play and the recent price point of 20 dollars makes it a steal for the value. Those who were ready to count out the PS2 as being \"down and out\" have to rethink their analysis at this point, because Rogue Galaxy is a fantastic game that you will only find for the PlayStation 2.8 out of 10 (4out of 5) --> \"Exceeds Excellence\"',\n",

       "  'description': \"Ninja Gaiden II is not much different from its predecessor. You play as Ryu Hayabusa, a 20-something ninja of the Dragon lineage. The story takes place six months after Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword for the DS, which in turn took place six months after Ninja Gaiden for the original Xbox.  The Black Spider Ninja clan (introduced in NG: Dragon Sword) and their leader, Genshin, steals a statue from Ryu's father. The story spirals into a one-man war against infernal creatures referred to as Fiends, as well as the rival Black Spider Ninjas. Ryu is joined by Sonia, a CIA agent who ultimately serves the same purpose as Rachel in NG for the original Xbox - a strong, big-breasted female side-character who Ryu feels obliged to keep safe. Ryu runs into several Greater Fiends who serve as many of the bosses in the game.  The story is presented through in-game cutscenes that tie the 14 Chapters together. NG for the original Xbox took heavy use of CG cinematics, but the strictly in-game cutscenes presented in this game are very satisfactory. The lip-syncing is usually spot on, and I am impressed by how natural the characters talk and react. The character models are also well done. Unfortunately, the story is not especially fleshed out. If you're picky about stories, you'll most likely feel like the story is tacked on. If you don't mind a B-movie script, I think you'll find the cutscenes very enjoyable to watch. The English voice-acting is usually pretty good. The adversaries have deep, bass-heavy voices that fit their characters, but the good guys usually feel cheesy with their softer voices, especially Ryu's father, who is emotion-less and bland. The Japanese voices are more thorough, and it's a nice touch that Ryu makes different sounds during combat in each language. Subtitles are available as well.  NGII doesn't push the boundaries of graphics like NGI did for the original Xbox, but the graphics are still very good. It is certainly the best-looking Team Ninja game so far. The characters and environments are generally very good-looking. One exception that stands out is during one point in a level where you drop into what seems like giant, connecting nostrils, with long tunnels covered in an ugly shade of green. Luckily this section of the level ends pretty quickly.  The musical score is pretty good. It's similar to other Team Ninja games, with focus on electric and drums. It fits pretty well. Sound effects are what you'd expect and cover every action.  The level designs are linear, but with many detours usually leading to helpful items. You usually won't have a problem knowing where to go, besides a couple of times where you have to go the way you came from. This is not a puzzle game, but you will have to find a key here to open that door over there and so on, but you do this less than in NGI. Being a ninja, you'll have to use acrobatics like wall-running and water-running. You'll have to do some swimming, but you can hold your breath infinitely (unlike in NGI). The swimming controls are the same, but the Spear Gun is replaced with the Gatling Gun, which turns into a fun mini-gun instead of the tedious one-shot system of the Spear Gun.  The game has gotten a lot of criticism for its camera. I don't think it's that bad. The camera is close on Ryu, which means that any attacks from behind are hard to predict, but I've never felt like the camera was fighting me. I'm sure anyone that invests some time into the game will get used to it pretty quickly. The camera can also be adjusted with the right stick and re-positioned behind Ryu with RT. During boss fights, the camera focuses on the boss and Ryu at the same time, which might be odd when the boss dashes across the screen, but generally the camera is fair. Still, some might be put off by it.  Ninja Gaiden II is all about the fighting, and it doesn't disappoint. The combat is as slick as ever. NGII introduces loads of new weapons, and unlike NGI where the Dragon Sword was superior, the gap between the Dragon Sword and the rest of the weapons isn't that big. Basically every Japanese melee weapon is here, including a giant scythe and nunchucks. Long range weapons are still here, like the Fiend Bow and several kinds of Shuriken. A new feature in NGII is Obliteration Techniques. The enemies now lose limbs as you fight them, and pressing Y near a dismembered enemy inflicts a cool execution. This can be done on enemies as they are falling onto the ground, which makes it extra satisfying. Ninpos are magical techniques that inflict great damage on one or several opponents. Ultimate Techniques are attacks where the player charges an attack long enough to unleash an extreme combo on one or more opponents. Ninja Gaiden remains one of the greatest when it comes to making a satisfying combat experience.  Slain enemies drop colored essence. Blue essence gives health. Red essence refills a slot of Ninpo. The most common, yellow essence, can be used to buy items or upgrades at the many shops in the game, or to speed up an Ultimate Technique. As well as these shops you will find Dragon Statues, where you can save your game and fully heal yourself. The new health meter replenishes itself when your enemies are killed, but the maximum health available is constantly drained as you take damage, which means you have to find a way to heal all the way up again, usually by visiting a Dragon Statue.  NGI was a challenging game, and it seems as Team Ninja took this as a compliment. Although the beginning of NGII is a nice introduction to new players, the difficulty gets a bit high later in the game. There are four difficulties, and I recommend anyone to do the lowest one first. I didn't find it very hard, but some of the bosses were a bit hard to crack. On the leaderboards it says I completed my first playthrough at 8.5 hours (not counting continues) with 55 continues. I assure you over 40 of those were at some of the later bosses. I only used the Dragon Sword, as there are achievements for completing the game only using the specified weapon. Some parts may seem cheap, like how the giant Armadillo explodes after you kill it, but you'll realize that it's not actually cheap. In this instance, simply holding block will save you from dying or having to use a Talisman of Rebirth. So although the game can feel too difficult or even cheap at first, I guarantee that you will get past it once you get more used to the enemies.  There is no multiplayer in this game besides Leaderboards and Cinema mode where you can record your play and share with friends, though uploading is apparently restricted to a certain part of the leaderboards. It's good that the game sports some achievements with replay value, like achievements for finding every Crystal Skull, completing each Test of Valor (a sort of a challenge that can be accessed at some points in the game), completing the game using just one weapon and completing it on each difficulty. I plan on going through the game many times.  If you're looking for the same experience that made NGI great, you shouldn't be disappointed. The game introduces loads of weapons, enemies and some fun dismembering, but is essentially more of the same. In this case, I don't see that as a bad thing. Casual gamers might want to stay away, since the difficulty can be high even on the lowest setting. Still, Ninja Gaiden II is a worthy sequel that provides extremely slick and satisfying action.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Lego Indiana Jones ReviewBeing a fan of the Indiana Jones franchise and one of the few people who really liked Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, naturally I've been very eager for an Indiana Jones game. L ego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures seems to be the closest I'm going to get for a little while. Having only briefly played Lego Star Wars I didn't know what to expect from Lego Indiana Jones, but after playing the game I'm mostly pleased. From what I've heard about the Star Wars games this game plays very similar.\\xa0The basic gameplay of Lego Indiana Jones is much the same as the Lego Star Wars games, building things out of Lego to solve puzzles. The only real difference being instead of using the force you're using your hands to physically build things, and instead of a light saber you have a whip. At first the puzzles will be varied and entertaining to figure out but as you start to progress through game you'll realise that you're doing the same tasks over and over again. So by the time you get up to the Temple of Doom story arc some things will feel a bit like a chore and the only real reason you're playing through the whole thing is to see your favorite Indy moments made out of Lego. Each chapter of the games story arcs allow you to play as 2 or more characters depending on where you are in the game. You'll need to switch between the characters given to you to solve puzzles. Each character has there own special abilities, for example Indiana will swing across things using his whip and women characters will jump higher than the male characters. This makes a lot of puzzles feel different even though there the same old thing you've been doing over and over. Also like the Lego Star Wars games there are a lot of hidden collectibles to dig up during the levels which unlock different characters and levels. These can be accessed through Barnett College which acts as the middle area between the chapters of the game. After completing a chapter it allows you to free play it with any of the characters you've unlocked to find the collectibles you may have missed on your first play through giving the game a lot of replay value.The story of Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures covers the first three Indiana Jones films, hence the title. Each story arc is split into 6 chapters. The different stories can be played in any order, so if you just want to play through 'The Last Crusade' and not the other two films you can. But that would be a tremendous waste of money considering how short the game already is. One of the games flaws is definitely its length; each story arc can be completed in 2 hours at the very most making the game only last about 4-5 hours for the average gamer. But hey its still Lego and Indiana Jones so I'll take what I'm given.The games graphics are nearly identical to the Lego Star War's games, but that was expected. How could they improve graphics where nearly everything is Lego. All the objects in the game world that you can interact with are made out of Lego so there will aren't many issues graphically, besides some objects looking pretty similar. I didn't experience any frame rate issues while playing. At the start and end of each chapter you'll be treated to hilarious cut scenes, which look no different to the gameplay graphically. There's not much to say about the games graphics, just that there Lego.As soon as you load the game you'll be treated to the Indiana Jones theme song, get used to it because you're going to be hearing it a lot. The games score consists of all the music you've heard from the films, so if you're a fan of the movies it will feel very familiar but it gets tiresome. You'll here the same music a lot, which will make you want to turn the volume down unless you like getting tunes stuck in your head. There is no dialogue in the game making it even more like the Star Wars games. You'll be treated to sort of a distorted mumbling sound during the cut scenes which is a good thing considering it fits perfectly with the feel of the game.I didn't want to have to compare this game to the Lego Star Wars game but I have to, the games are pretty much the same besides the different characters and story. Even if you haven't played Lego Star Wars a whole lot you'll feel like you've played the game before. If you're looking for a well thought out, lengthy game you're not going to get it from this. But if your looking for a quick game that will take your mind off things for a few hours, this games for you.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"  Assassins Creed is an engaging game the first time you experience what it has to offer. Clearly the best part of the game is the movement of which Altaïr is able to complete, as he can leap and move in ways similar to the activity of 'Parkour'. The movement of Altair is fantastic, especially when watching him crookedly climb upwards to the top of a building or running   across  the roofs of houses to escape the guards of the city. This is undeniably the strongest part of Assassins Creed as it is thrilling to watch his realistic movement. Altaïrs use of the cities is also great, which reminds me of early Tomb Raider climbing in the search for specific ledges. Assassins Creed develops this style of movement but branches out further, and uses more of the buildings small architecture. This allows for a more realistic style of climbing.   The graphics in the game are generally great.  But there are small noticeable glitches throughout, which take away from the immersion.    Assassins Creed Is fantastic for the movement and graphics, but the game is brought down by technical issues and the plot. The end of the game is unsatisfying and left me wanting more from the story, which is   disappointing  as the start of the game nicely set up the base plot. Towards the end of the game I felt the story growing less engaging and more an 'add-on' the game. One of the main reasons for feeling not attached is the dull assassinations that are assigned to you throughout the game. After the second or third killing that you are forced to commit, you soon  realise  that this is all that the game has to offer. There is no different approach to the killings either, just attack from your own angle, and kill. That’s it.  The fighting system is simple and fun to watch, but it easily becomes repetitive.  The motions of these fights are good, but like many other parts of the game it becomes a strain and does not differ in movement or look.    Some of the AI in the game can be considered unfinished as there actions are questionable at points. In the time I spent playing this game, I successfully counted six enemy guards getting stuck in the walls and   that’s  not even considering the civilians in the game. Basically these small bugs withdraw from the games atmosphere and really take away from the games belief.  Putting the issues aside that Assassins Creed has, I still found parts of the game enjoyable. I feel that because of the hype and excitement that built up the game it was a   disappointment  that  Ubisoft  would not work on the things such as - improve the fighting mechanics or 'Iron out' the small glitches that all bring down the game.\\xa0 After talking to other people about there views on this game, I decided that Assassins Creed is a game that either grabs you or   isn’t  that interesting at many points. I personally recommend that if you feel Assassins Creed looks impressive that you first rent out the game.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Not a very creative title. I suppose I could have put a bit more effort into it. Although the same could be said about Ken Levine and The Biggest Disappointment in Gaming History… Hey, that’s not a bad title.  BioShock’s biggest problem is that it doesn’t live up to the incredibly high expectations set by the master and commander Levine, hell, it doesn’t even live up to the mediocre expectations of any shooter/RPG/epic story game. The game starts out on a solid premise, underwater dystopia? Awesome. Genetically modified supermen? Incredible! BioShock? Disappointing. As a shooter BioShock is serviceable. You have your running, you have your gunning, but in the end it adds nothing new to the genre. As an RPG it is limited. There are no classes in BioShock, instead there are multi-level perks and powers to upgrade your character with. The perks modify health or mechanical abilities but they are basically a second thought. What had everyone wet for BioShock were the powers genetically spliced into you. Basically you have fire, freeze, and electricity, throw in some bees for fun but you won’t need the rest. When I say the powers and perks are multi-level I mean that in a purely statistical sense, Fire level 1 looks and acts exactly like Fire level 3. You can also upgrade weapons but you can’t upgrade all of the weapons fully with one run through so you have to choose carefully. My suggestion? DON’T.  This brings me to BioShock’s next glaring flaw; it is too damn easy. The basic enemies, and by basic enemies I mean any enemy that isn’t a Big Daddy or a boss, can be taken out with the Freeze-Them-and-Beat-Them-With-Your-Wrench Combo (or as it is called in the game; The ol’ One-Two combo). And since it is the best way to dispose of the underwater mutants there is really no reason, outside of trying every weapon once (and some you will only try once) and running out of EVE, to ever use anything else. And for the other guys, the Big Daddies, the true stars of Bioshock, well, they really don’t offer up any more of a challenge than any other bad guy, except they are tougher. That is unless you have a fully upgraded shotgun, or just some Electro-Gel, that’s the stuff that the 60’s Batman would have whipped out of his all-purpose utility belt and called Big Daddy repellent. But, if you’re looking for a challenge though, I recommend a different game, when you succumb to the throes of death there is only a negligible penalty so there is really nothing but Ken Levine telling you to “use traps and the environment against the Big Daddies” stopping you from just charging the Big Daddy until it bites the dust. “So, why wouldn’t I use traps and the environment against the Big Daddies?” you might ask. Aside from me telling you that you don’t have to, there aren’t really any to speak of. As far as environmental hazards you got water and gas. Burn the gas, shock the water. Next. Traps, the possibilities are limited, how limited? You get one. Crossbow tripwires. Awesome!  Well, at least those genetically mutated supermen (and women) are cool. All FIVE enemy models have a recognizable human form, bloody face, and dirty clothes. Some have hooks, for the life of me I can’t imagine who thought that would be an improvement. The only enemy models that break from the traditional five are the bosses. Aesthetically they are basically exactly the same, aside from a change of clothes and really that makes all the difference. Physically they are just a stronger version of one of the enemy types. None of them offer up much anything in terms of a challenge and really they are just benchmark to let you know how much more you have to put up with. The final benchmark, the final boss, is the one that breaks all preconceived notions about what an genetically altered citizen of an underwater dystopia can look like, and he will have you laughing all the way to the credits. For a mental picture think Zed from the original Power Rangers, minus the awesome. But with this incredibly underdesigned model comes sweet relief, the end, the stunning conclusion. Apparently there are 3 alternate endings, I would have loved to sit through the 12 hour campaign again and focus on not killing the Little Sisters, I mean ripping out sea slugs, to see the montage of blue tinted pictures accompanied by a dramatic voice over but by that time I had already sold back my copy to GameStop for 14 bucks… suckers.  And that’s what it’s all about isn’t it? Levine called out the limited RPG elements and the bare bones shooting and instead offered us an “emotionally gripping thrill ride that is BioShock”. That’s not an actual quote, or maybe it is, who cares. To me listening to tape decks isn’t exactly ‘emotionally gripping,’ usually when dealing with a visual medium I like to actually SEE what is going on. The tape deck system isn’t a story telling device, it’s a brilliant ploy to by Ken Levine not to hire animators. There are no FMVs, no cut scenes, just in game cinematics that are mediocre at best. Even the end is just a bunch of pictures with a voice over telling you that you saved or destroyed the world. But I will admit, when I first played BioShock I thought I liked it, when playing I bought into the reviews and the hype, I had too. I mean I dropped 60 bucks on it. But when it was all said and done, when the credits rolled on BioShock a feeling of emptiness swept over me. I felt used, violated, and mocked. Mocked by Ken Levine and his BioShock. Ken was laughing at me, laughing at everyone who bought his shtick, and we bought it wholesale. Everything in BioShock is undercooked, we get tape decks when we should have cut scenes, we get FIVE enemies when we should get Twenty-Five, and we get cartoony graphics when we should get arresting visuals depth and life. We get it all under the name of ‘art’ that’s how Ken sold it to us, a piece of art. It is not art. It is a gimmick, a sales pitch, a safety net that let Ken put out a product with minimal effort.  By now I’m sure everyone who reads this will have bought or at least played BioShock but if this review can stop one, just one person from making the same mistake so many of us did I will die a happy reviewer. Jeff Gerstmann himself as you may remember gave this game a shinning review, a 9 out of 10 on the .5 increment GameSpot scale, but I say it is not too late! You are free of your shackles, I too fell for the game when I played it but now time has passed remember, remember the game for what it is. I implore you to right the wrongs of yesterday, absolve yourself of your sins and revaluate this game. If not for me then for you own soul.  -\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Aquaman',\n",

       "  'description': 'Ah. Burnout. Possibly the greatest arcade racing series ever. Well, the first two titles might not have been the greatest, but after EA stepped in, things changed. For the better. Burnout 3: Takedown was groundbreaking and deserved the critical acclaim it achieved. Dodging traffic at incredible speeds while taking out opponents was easily affiliated to Burnout 3. This time, everything is turned up a notch.  The first thing you’ll notice is the new slick menu interface with one of the game’s faster vehicles blazing trough traffic in the background. Create your profile and the game will see if you have a Burnout 3 or Madden 06 save file. If you have one of these you’ll get an extra car in Crash mode. Two if you have both save files. Now you can get started on the World Tour to get new cars, play one of the games multiplayer modes or dive into Xbox Live. The first event you’ll play in World Tour is Traffic Attack in one of the game’s sunnier tracks, Sunshine Keys. Traffic Attack is the new mode in Burnout Revenge and introduces Traffic Checking. In Revenge, you can “check” traffic by ramming into them. You can only hit same-way traffic that’s smaller than trailers and big rigs, though. This is a good thing, because it would have been too easy if you could just blaze trough traffic. Also, it allows for much more traffic without it getting too difficult. Still, it would be nice if there were more big rigs and trailers to avoid. You can also do Traffic Check Takedowns by launching traffic into opponents. In Traffic attack, your car is armed with explosives and a countdown on the top of the screen shows when the bomb will go off. When the timer goes below 20 seconds, checking traffic increases your time left. Your goal in Traffic Attack is to score big by checking traffic while keeping your timer over 0.00. The fastest way to earning scores and gaining seconds on the clock is by doing trick and skill shots. For example, send a van flying onto an oncoming bus to get an Awesome Skill Shot.  Awesome is a word you’ll want to see often in Burnout Revenge. It’s the best you can get in the new rating system. Your driving is rated while you drive, ranging from OK to Awesome. Doing Takedowns and skillful stunts like Awesome Drift quickly heightens your rating. Get a Gold Medal and an Awesome rating to Perfect an event. This’ll earn you 5 stars that add up to your rank. There are 10 ranks in the game. You’ll start with Harmless and finally reach the last rank, Elite. Reaching Elite Rank also unlocks a car based on a certain upcoming shooting game from Criterion, makers of the Burnout series. Ranks are reached by earning enough stars. Stars are obtained by getting medals and ratings in events. As before mentioned, getting Awesome rating and a Gold Medal gives you five stars, while getting a less great result gives less stars. Reaching Elite Rank is way too easy, as you don’t even need to Perfect most of the events. It feels too short when you rank up almost every time, often without even starting many of the events in your previous ranks. Each rank unlocks its own series of events spread around some of the tracks in Revenge.  The tracks of Burnout have been heavily improved from Burnout 3, with lots of jumps and shortcuts to vary the experience. With all these jumps, Revenge also introduces the new Vertical Takedowns. Simply do a jump and mysteriously manage to land on an opponent to do one of these. You’ll need to do a Vertical Takedown in each location as it is one of the 8 Challenges found in every Challenge Sheet for the game’s 8 locations. Clever mathematicians can easily calculate that there are a total of 64 challenges, although not very (or at all) different from location to location. Other challenges include blowing up 25 vehicles in a Crash event at Sunshine Keys (the hardest in my opinion) and taking down a special car in a race event. This is usually a car that stands out from your other opponents, probably a Special car like the Logitech Racer (an F1 with Logitech Decals). Another challenge is to do a certain amount of Revenge Takedowns. Revenge Takedowns are achieved by taking out an opponent that has taken you out. Complete the Challenge Sheet for a location to unlock a Special car.  Let’s talk Crash. It’s awesome. This time around, it’s even better. Unfortunately, the quantity is heavily decreased from Burnout 3’s 100 Crash events to fewer, but much bigger events. Still, the quality doesn’t seem good enough to make up for the loss of quantity. The Crash mode has seen great changes this time. The first you’ll notice is the Golf-style meter that determines your car’s acceleration. Remember the tricky spin/release gas/throttle combinations you had to perform to start with a boost in Burnout 3? Now you just need to hit the green spots to get a Perfect start and a full boost. Most crash locations have big jumps. Jumping in Crash mode feels breathtaking and the weight and wind on your car affects the way you control in-air. Hit traffic and let her rip! Watch as traffic pile up and use your Aftertouch cleverly to position your car where you want it. As traffic gets damaged and more cars are mixed in the pile-up(s), your Boost meter grows. When it reaches 100% you need to button-mash B to set off the Crashbreaker. The button-mashing seems a little stupid though, especially as the cars with greater Crashbreakers are impossible to use fully as your thumb is not fast enough. You can also use the Crashbreaker several times, as long as the meter grows to 100%. On the upper-left corner on the screen there’s a counter that shows how many cars have been involved in the pile-up, and how many vehicles there are in total. There’s of course a great challenge if you want to get all vehicles to join the pile-up(s), which is not easy. The Crash cars you drive yourself are not particularly impressive compared to the ones in Burnout 3. I really miss the Fire Truck… And even here the cars come in updated versions, which has always been the worst aspect of the Burnout series.  Oh yes. The cars! Criterion got there own car designers, and boy did they do well! The cars are incredibly stylish. There’s a total of 78 cars (80 if you have the two save files) in Revenge. The “normal” cars are the cooler ones. The two cars you start with have a boost speed of 160 mph and have similar designs as the Sport and Super classes in Burnout 3. So no silly compact cars this time! You’ll unlock cars fast, as Revenge suffers from being too easy for anyone familiar with the Burnout series. Burnout Revenge also updates there vehicles, apparently not caring that it’s the weaker aspects of the series… You could say they’re in 3 classes; ST, DX and GT. But they’re not ordered like in Burnout 3. They’re ordered after how good they are or how exclusive they are. Finding your favorite car simply means horizontally scrolling through the many vehicles. There are really just 16 cars that have a really unique design when not counting Crash or Special cars… For example, a Factory M-Type DX is an updated version of the Factory M-Type ST, while the Factory Type GT is an updated version of the Factory M-Type DX. So there are 46 cars that are won by completing events in World Tour, plus the two you start with, the 12 Special cars you’ll get by achieving certain goals and 18 Crash vehicles. Then there’s two extra that are unlocked by having certain save files… Strangely, I got 100% before I should have, simply because I have an extra car from my Burnout 3 save file. I still miss 2 Signature Takedowns to get the last Special car and a rightful 100%… Signature Takedowns are back, with a total of 24 (3 in each location).  You’ve also got the modes from Burnout 3, like Road Rage, Race, Eliminator, Preview and Burning Lap. Some of these have changed. In the Eliminator mode the last placed driver is eliminated per 30-seconds, not per lap. And the timer in Road Rage has changed too. It’s much shorter, often starting at 30-50 seconds, but time is extended by doing 2 or 3 takedowns before time runs out. Another cool change is the Crashbreaker events. Race, Road Rage and Eliminator includes Crashbreakers in the later ranks! Just like in Burnout 3’s Crash mode, press B to set off the Crashbreaker. This is only available if you’ve crashed or have been taken out. Take an opponent with you in the explosion to get an Explosive Payback. Of course, taking more opponents with you means bigger score and bigger chance to win. The best is Total Payback, where you blow up all 5 opponents (Race or Eliminator). Hit no one at all, and you’ll waste your boost.  This is also an excellent Live and multiplayer game.  The racing itself is great. Everything blurs and the screen tends to shake. Especially when jumping in Crash, as everything shakes and feels like the big jump it is.  Now… Music! The featured soundtrack includes 41 songs from artists like The Doors, Animal Alpha, Yellowcard, The Chemical Brothers and LCD Soundsystem. My favorite song is The Big Jump by The Chemical Brothers. That beat is so awesome… The soundtrack is improved from Burnout 3, but still has a bit too much punk rock over it. It’s more hard-core rock (Animal Alpha is an example) and Techno (The Bravery is an example), thankfully. But of course, Xbox owners like me can easily switch to custom soundtracks and listen to their favorite music, in my case Rap. That’s my fizzle, drizzle… The sound effects are also amazing, especially in Crash. You can almost feel the explosions and the metal crushing!  All in all, Burnout Revenge actually isn’t the best in the series. All of these new features and improvements mean nothing when the difficulty is so incredibly easy. The 169 events are simply unchallenging, even the timed races that were so hard in Burnout 3. There’s also room for improvements. There are plenty of obvious glitches that haven’t been sorted out, like the Crash Cam appearing when you haven’t crashed yet and so on. They still need to vary the car designs more and turn up the difficulty. And there’s no Single Race! And what happened to Crash FM? I didn’t like it in Burnout 3, but they could have tried improving it and not just limit it to introduction and training videos! I found that voice to be damn sexy… But still, this is an awesome racer. You’ll get all the things that made Burnout 3 great and more, especially if you thought it was too hard, but anyone looking for a challenging Burnout game might be disappointed.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Who nowadays hasn’t gotten their proverbial rock on with some guitar hero by now? Whether it was Ozzy who did it for you in the first Guitar Hero or the sweet sound of the Allman Brothers from the second, chances are you have come across this phenomenon by now. Well in the style of milking cash cows for all they’re worth, Activision gives us yet another game to wet our appetites with. Which ordinarily would be a good thing, right?We have all heard it before so let me get it out of the way: Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80’s is a $50 expansion pack. There end of review. Oh you want more? Well this is basically a dig at their well. You get thirty songs, which is like the first game. Difference is, you don’t get anything else. 30 songs, that’s the game. Sure it has some characters to choose from, six, and some venues, six and of course lots of guitars to make your dude cool looking, but there is a severe lack of substance. This game just has no meat on it. Breaking it down, we work first on the charactors. You will find there are the classics, good ol’ Johnny, tough as nails Axel, gothic Judy, pop star Izzy, crazy hairdo Pandora, and the store bought Grim. So what is the problem with them? Well taking aside the fact that there are two missing, Winston and Xavior, the characters have a very recycled feel to them, much like the rest of the game. They haven’t really touched them up from Guitar Hero II. Aside from updating their appearance, they still look for the most part lifeless as far as facial and body expressions. While they are playing, they don’t have a guitar strap, (that bothers me to all kinds of craziness!) they have these generic rock pose cycles that they go through that look just plain lame, and they just don’t have a good sense of personality. Given the fact that you only get six characters to express your inner rock, they could have at least touched them up to handle more of the feeling.The venues haven’t changed with the exception of, again updating appearance. Like the characters, they aren’t all present. Those who liked Stonehenge from the second will be saddened to find it painfully missing from this iteration. Though, to be fair, the track list is shorter so they couldn’t break them evenly. The grand finale is just you exploding no space ship taking you off and changing the stars. (That was a really nice touch I though!) So here again we have a nice solid feeling of recycled napkin or tissue whichever metaphor you enjoy.That aside lets get down to why anyone in their right mind would buy this game in the first place, the songs man, the songs! These don’t leave you hanging too much. Notably the master tracks, though you may be unsure if Flock of Seagulls is something you want to experience first hand, few can argue with Judas Priest’s Electric Eye. (They even put the Hellion in too!) All in all there are about 10 to 20 songs that you would actually want to play. Does anyone know why X’s Las Angles was added in there? That song is just the worst example of tone deaf awfulness that I have ever had the misfortune to come in contact with. The technical level of the songs on the harder modes still gives that same satisfying feeling which is important. You really feel an accomplishment when you can blaze through Play With Me, or in my case stumble through without failing! The biggest problem in the game, though, is the complete lack of dueling guitars. All the songs play guitar/bass on two-player coop. We all know that Glenn and K. K. wouldn’t appreciate that on their masterpiece and I don’t appreciate it either. This is just another blatant example of how to milk a cash cow without much effort.So what is the bottom line? I gave this game a 6 out of 10 which puts it at “Fun” on my scale. I would say that if you seriously like at least half of the songs on this game and you really don’t mind paying full price for a half-butt attempt, pick it up. If anything else it gives you just that many more ways to rock out. It is Guitar Hero and that is all that matters in the end isn\\'t it?6 out of 10 (3 out of 5) > \"Fun\"',\n",

As you do you will level up earning new upgrades for your equipment, which are needed to comfortably play through the later quests. At the start of the game you'll be given the opportunity to select which character class you would like to be. These include: Warrior, Archer and Sorceress. Each have there own fighting styles and Alter Ego forms. Alter Ego forms are special abilities that your character can use to transform into a big beast (relating to your characters class) to help clear away some monsters quickly.The story is very transparent a long winded. You'll never feel like you're involved in the story and near the end of the game you'll just want it to finish.The sound and graphics are average. The level design is very plain and you can tell that a lot of it was recycled. Most of the monsters sound strikingly similar and there is no dialogue but that's to be expected from a Xbox Live Arcade Title.Arkadian Warriors is a fun Arcade title that has very basic game play that draws heavily from games like Diablo.

       " {'deck': 'Great simulator with unmatched realism and a smart AI',\n",
       "  'description': 'This is one of the greatest racing simulators to hit videogames so far.  There are a total of 231 cars in the game, unless I remembered wrong. These, like you would expect, range from Honda Civic SI Hatchback to Chrysler ME Four-Twelve to Toyota GT-One! These are again divided in classes; D4, D3, D2, D1, C4, C3, C2, C1, B4, B3, B2, B1, A4, A3, A2, A1, S4, S3, S2, S1, GT, GTS and P1.  D to S cars are (somewhat) street-legal cars with D4 being slowest and S1 being fastest. GT and GTS are the sort of racing-only cars you\\'ll see in championships, usually street-legal cars tuned way beyond street-legal... Like Mercedes-Benz CLK DTM. P1 are the fastest, purpose-built cars like Toyota GT-One.  Your car\\'s class change when you upgrade it though. A stock D car can quickly get into the S class if you have the money! The quickest way through classes is with the engine. 700 horsepowers under the hood is never a bad thing, but racing-only tires and decreased weight is always helpful. These are not the only options for modding though. Engine upgrades include Turbos, Superchargers, Intercoolers and so on. Aero and visual upgrades include Hoods, Rims, Bumpers, Window Tinting, Spoilers and more. Chassis and Drivetrain include Suspension, Tires, Weight Reduction, brakes, etc. Aero/visual upgrades are usually limited or few according to your car. A Honda Civic can have plenty, but you can\\'t change anything but rims and tints on a Ferrari Enzo...  Painting your car is really awesome. There are the typical painting options where you can separately paint the base, hood or maybe mirrors and spoilers depending on your car.   Then there are the decals and vinyls. You change the position of where you paint by moving the thumbstick up or down. Left side, right side, rear, front, above (hood, roof, etc) and spoiler (if your car has one) can be decorated with 100 decals/vinyls on each side! The number of decals also depends on your car... Vinyls are not too many, but you can spin and stretch and tilt them to make crazy combinations, but it would still be nice with more vinyls... You can also do the same with decals, but you can\\'t stretch a decal horizontally but not vertically. My only complaint with the decals is that they often look chunky when resized. There\\'s some useful \"Layer Options\" as well. These are options like Cut, Copy, Insert, Delete and the useful Paste All Layers From Left Side (assuming you’re on the right side).  The excellent graphics makes painting much more fun than in tuner games like NFS Underground 2. Not as good as in GT4, but still very good.  Another thing I should mention is the carbon-fiber options. Like in other tuners you can\\'t paint carbon-fiber parts. In this game they look darker than in other tuners as well.  With the GT, GTS and P1 cars you can\\'t change a thing except for small tuning like gear-ratios, tire pressure and downforce. There are more tuning options though.  With some \"pre-tuned\" cars you usually can\\'t change painting and decals/vinyls. With \"pre-tuned\" I mean cars like Honda Mugen S2000 and Mitsubishi Lancer Evo VI Tommy Makinen. There\\'s a lot of this kind of cars in the game. There\\'s probably 5 different Mazda RX-7\\'s in the game, some \"normal\", some not...  Oh yeah, maybe I should mention the actual racing... As I\\'ve mentioned, the realism is unmatched and the AI is really smart. There\\'s a really good damage modeling with both visuals and performance being affected. All the cars handle differently and are definitely affected by modifications and small tuning like Tire Pressure and Downforce.  Racing modes are none out of the ordinary. There\\'s Arcade mode, Career mode, Free run and similar. Arcade mode is, well Arcade.... Complete all races with the car of your choice, whether it\\'s from your Garage or from a certain class, to unlock new cars available in Free Run, Time Attack and Arcade. This has no effect in Career, though.  Career mode is very typical. Race in different events to win cars and money. When you start Career mode you can choose from Europe, Asia and North-America as starting point. I chose Europe and could choose from cars like Audi TT and Volkswagen Golf as my first car. Choosing region also affects car prices and unlockables. When you’re in Europe a Volvo costs less, while a Honda or Ford costs more. Naturally. It affects unlockables because the cars you win by reaching a certain level are changed. Levels are reached by making money from races. Not by selling cars and/or parts... For example, when I reached lvl 5 I won a partnership with Acura and a free Acura NSX!  By reaching levels you don\\'t only win cars, you also get discount on car parts. By reaching the final level, 50, parts are pretty cheap \\'cause of the 50% discount!  The events in Career mode are often limited to stuff like a certain class or engine power. This also means that an A1 Toyota Supra would be better in an A-only event than as a S4 car in an S-only event, forcing you to think before tuning a car to the max.  The garage has space for seemingly unlimited cars, and you can buy the same car over and over again to tune it differently.  Still, there are some bugs and such. For example, adding vinyls might look weird on some cars or the \"Paste All Layers From Left/Right Side\" function doesn\\'t work correctly. Another disappointment is the length in the races. I just don\\'t bother racing 2 laps in Nürburgring to complete one fifth of an event....  The music is produced by JunkieXL, which means lame guitar tunes, but there\\'s a customized soundtracks option. The music plays all the time and it remembers what kind of music you selected and if it\\'s random or from start to finish.  The difficulty can be customized, whether its AI skill or aids like Traction Control System and Driving Aid. Driving Aid is a dynamic Throttle-Brake-Turn\" helper which turns red when you should brake and green when you should throttle, displayed as arrows on the ground. Sometimes it\\'s better not to obey it completely. It tends to underestimate your car/skills...  All in all, this is an awesome racer with an awesome tuning option. Why is it better than GT4? Awesome tuning, amazing AI, cool damage modeling and so on.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Welcome to the Black Mesa Research Facility. With that one sentence, the entire world of video gaming as we knew it changed forever. Gordon Freeman became something of gaming legend. Everyone knows at least one aspect or another of his historical journey to the surface and beyond. The game of course is Half-Life, and it is quite hard to forget. Through its ingenious use of imagination, creativity, and programming, this game has left its mark in every first person shooter to date. This game is at the same level as Doom for breakthrough performances.Like most gamers, you would think of Half-Life as a PC game, and by all means, it is, but some people prefer consoles rather then a PC. Therefore this wont be a comparison between the two, this is strictly a review of the PlayStation2 version as if it wasn’t a PC game at all. That being said, lets get started.This game has one incredible story. As the game starts out, you play as the sub-level scientist Gordon Freeman working in an underground research facility. You begin the day as ordinary as any other with an analysis of some strange mineral samples. That is where the ordinary comes to a screeching halt. Something goes terribly wrong and you find yourself as the only person with enough sanity left to piece together just what exactly happened and try to put things back together. Through countless layer upon layer, you slowly work your way to the surface to uncover exactly what is going on. From the revolutionary intro sequence, to the creepy government agent guy, and through to the heart pounding end, this game delivers on all fronts. It is excellent to the fullest extent of the word and you would be hard pressed to find someone who says otherwise.The actual game play isn’t half bad. The control scheme, as with most console FPS, takes some getting used to. Once you have mastered the aim timing and movement sensitivity, you are pretty much good to go. The main thing that becomes almost immediately annoying is the brief but constant load times between sequences. You won’t be sitting there for long but right when you are getting into the game, or hurrying to find health and recover, which you will be doing constantly, you get this polite little Loading message. But with the given technology you can’t expect much in that regard, it doesn’t really take much away from the experience anyways. It is just something worth mentioning. Throughout the game you will battle many different types of foes to get to your overall objective, which changes as the story progresses. After completing the game you have the opportunity to play through another sequence of events characterized with the game’s second main mode, coop. This is an awesome addition to the game since the main story itself is worth getting, but to also get this extra little game mode, well that is just to good to pass up. This works in a series of level like sequences where you and your buddy get rated as to how well you do overall. The main story is long, about 30 maybe 40 hours of straight playing time, and the coop, though it isn’t very long has good replay value. All in all that gives the game a pretty decent appeal all things considered.I would try to put something negative about the game down but frankly, there just isn’t anything bad about it. This game is spectacular! Everyone should play though it at least once even if they don’t buy it for themselves. The game gets a perfect 10 out of 10 from my scale, which puts it at “Revolutionary.” Truly a title that few ever achieve on my list, but this game, even though it may not be the “grand daddy” of all shooters (I suspect Doom would have that honor,) it definitely lifts and defines the bar for what a FPS could and should look like. Bottom line: get it. This game deserves to be in everyone’s collection. ',\n",

       "  'description': \"DOA Ultimate is a remake of Dead Or Alive 2 and 1. You'll get one disc for each game in the same package. DOA 1 (being the Saturn game it is) is a look back at the primitive yet slightly enjoyable game that started it all. Not a bad game at all, but the casual gamer probably won't be playing this game too much. DOA 2 however, is extremely polished and has tremendous graphics. My biggest complaint is the lack of moves. Many of my favourites moves and combo throws from DOA 3 is absent in DOA 2, but the reason is of course that they weren't on the original DOA 2... This robs the game of gameplay and was very unwanted with me.  The arenas are pretty cool, with many more stairs and stuff, but there's just too few of them.  DOA 2 features a large amount of costumes, where some characters (like Kasumi) can have 20 costumes. Of course the later costumes are from the Xtreme Beach Volleyball game and will bring joy to many breast-lovers out there... The costumes are 137 in total and there's only 2 per character who doesn't need to be unlocked! These are unlocked by completing Story mode with the character you need costumes for. Or if you have unlocked the unlockable characters (you need a DOA 3 save file to unlock the last one) you can collect all items in Survival mode to completely unlock all costumes and extras. These extras include G4TV's look behind the Dead Or Alive series, GC gallery (collection of sexy pics from DOA XBV) and a booster which you can use to get the costumes for your DOA 3 file! The latter is the extra I cared most about... But once you've gotten all the 66 items in Survival (which takes surprisingly short time) there isn't much to do! If you're like me and have played through DOA 3's Story mode uncountable times and remember almost every move sequence from the characters, gameplay falls to zero in DOA Ultimate. Here's where Live play comes in, though. It's a good Live function, but the lack of moves makes it a lesser experience than it could have been if there was Live on DOA 3...  The sound in the game is what you'll expect: lame music, but cool sound effects and shouts.  The Story mode in DOA Ultimate is very disappointing. It explains nearly nothing and has a total of maybe 5 minutes with video per character that's not even CG! And the final boss is a cliché in looks and a downer in the moves department. And there's only 7 stages.  Brad Wong, Christie and Hayate are missing in DOA Ultimate, only Tengu (the boss) is new in the game. And if you don't have a DOA 3 save file either, Hitomi isn't playable.  All in all, this is a DOA game and therefore a great fighting game, but since it's a remake of DOA 2 and 1, people who are looking for a game that have more to offer compared to DOA 3 while be disappointed. Live and more costumes are of course great, but they're just the few things that keeps this from being a game no DOA 3 player should buy. DOA 3 was much better, even without Live and many costumes. Luckily, unlocking the Booster in DOA Ultimate makes the experience on DOA 3 much better!  I hope DOA 4 won't disappoint that much, but it's practically certain that it won't.\",\n",

It was hitherto one of the most violent and mature games ever released while creating an entirely new genre, the sandbox. All these years later, \\xa0it's still clear why this was a classic in the first place, but the dated presentation and some pacing issues make it feel slightly unpolished. As a result, GTA III doesn't feel quite as fresh as it did the day it came out, but it's still a whole lot of fun.In Grand Theft Auto III, you take the role of an unnamed criminal who has been betrayed by his girlfriend accomplice and convicted of robbery.

From then on you're on your own in Liberty City (a city loosely based on New York City), and you'll have to find a way to stay afloat the only way you know how--with crime.You can fulfill all of your wildest crime fantasies in Liberty City. Any car on the street is open game. You simply walk up to a car and press triangle to wrench the driver out and speed away. There are endless possibilities with this car-stealing mechanic. You can steal taxis and drive people around in a Crazy Taxi-style mini game to rack up cash, or you can steal cop cars and hunt down criminals vigilante-style. You'll also be able to get behind the wheel of an ambulance and try to get people to the hospital as fast as possible for some quick cash.There's also lots of mayhem to be caused on foot. For example, you can start fights with anyone on the street. Whether you've got a baseball bat, a flame-thrower, or simply your bare fists, beating the living crap out of innocent civilians is always fun. There's always something to keep you occupied in Liberty City.Liberty City is a mostly realistic atmosphere, so there are consequences for your actions. If you get out of hand and start running over too many people or try to steal a car right in front of a cop, you'll alert the police. At first you'll only have a one-star rating and the cops will forget about you if you outrun them. But once you get two or more stars, you won't be able to lose the cops unless you spend $1000 to repaint your car at the shop, making you unrecognizable to the cops. It's not like alerting the cops takes away from the fun though. Once you get farther in the game and you start getting chased by multiple cars and helicopters, it can be a blast trying to race the cops to your target before getting killed.Although it's possible to spend hours causing random havoc in the streets of Liberty CIty, you're missing out on a lot of the fun if you don't progress in the story. Scattered across the mini-map in the bottom-left corner of the screen are markers that highlight spots where you can find new missions. Various people of power in Liberty City will give you loads of dough for you to do their dirty work.Most missions involve some combination of stealing cars, retrieving and delivering packages, and wasting gangsters. You'll have to use your mini-map to get to your locations and do what you've been sent to do. The nature of the game encourages choices, and you'll be able to take out your targets in various ways. The quickest way to kill someone is to run them over, but if your target is in an area thats can't be reached by car, or they have enough firepower to blow up your car if you get too close, you'll have to resort to using weapons. You'll have a variety of different guns, including a pistol, some automatic machine guns, a sniper rifle, and eventually flame-throwers and rocket launchers. All of these weapons come in handy in different situations and it's a lot of fun figuring out the best way to take someone out. Every player completes missions differently, but as long as you earn the cash, it doesn't really matter how you get it done.But what good would a whole bunch of dirty money be if you couldn't spend it? In each of the three islands of Liberty City there is a shop called Ammu-Nation where you'll be able to buy guns as well as grenades and armor. Even so, it's really difficult to get low on cash in the game. Besides buying weapons and paying one or two ransoms, you won't really have anything to spend your money on. As a result, you'll always have way more money than you need, and this makes the money you get for completing missions feel less important. It would've been more fun if cash was a little harder to come by, encouraging you to find other means of earning cash, like completing side missions or collecting taxi fares.Most of these missions are pretty straight-forward, but the final few get cruelly difficult to the point of frustration. Once you fail a mission, you can't restart it unless you drive all the way back to the person who appointed it to you. Some of the harder missions are really long and drawn out, so you'll have to trudge through them multiples times and won't be able to retry them instantly. This becomes a problem in the final couple of missions where they pour loads of enemies on you and give you very few weapons to deal with them. It almost feels like a cheap way to lengthen the game, or just a poor decision all-around by Rockstar. These missions really detract from the experience if you're looking to complete the story without using cheats, because it's very easy to give up once you get stuck at this point.The game's huge variety of music and fitting voice acting give it a lot of character. Whenever you get into a car you'll have a choice of several radio stations to listen to, including two talk stations. The genres range the entire gamut from classical to rap and everything in between. The talk radio stations are particularly entertaining, consisting entirely of spoofs based on racial and social stereotypes. The commercials have the same sort of satirical humor, advertising SUVs big enough to get lost in and outrageous weight loss programs involving electrocuting yourself in your sleep. Voices are also a highlight of the game. The gangsters you work for have thick New York accents and the different raced characters like the Colombians and Japanese also have fitting accents. The prostitute Maria that you'll be dealing with a lot in the game has a particularly memorable sassy voice that you'd expect from an overconfident and overpayed whore. It's also worth noting that the character you play as has no voice at all. This works out well, because it keeps the main character mysterious, but it also feels kind of odd since everyone else in the game has such a distinct personality.While the sound is probably one of Grand Theft Auto III's greatest strengths, the graphics feel dated compared to today's standards. The world looks fairly realistic and the car models passable at best, but character models lack detail we've come to expect, like fingers and facial expressions. The colors also feel a little washed out. Most of the buildings are gray and a lot of the cars are dull shades of blue and red. The water in the game looks rather bland too -- it's basically a flat texture that sometimes moves up and down when it starts to rain. All in all, the most indicative sign of Grand Theft Auto III's age is its graphics, but in a game that's main focus is giving you a huge world to do what you want in, this really isn't that big of a deal.All flaws aside, Grand Theft Auto III is still a classic, and this fact is evident even to people who are just now playing the game for their first time. The freedom Rockstar gave the player was unprecedented at the time, and although the missions could have been designed a little better (read: easier), this game is really fun no matter how you cut it. If you're looking for the best Grand Theft Auto experience you can find, you might want to start with the much improved upon sequels simply because they do the same thing this game does, but better. Otherwise, this is still a really fun game for any mature action fan and is well worth the five dollars or less it'll cost you.\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'Ninja Gaiden II Review - My First Review',\n",
       "  'description': \"Ninja Gaiden II. When I first saw the game, it looked promising and fun. The first Ninja Gaiden was a lot of fun to play and, what is perhaps, one of the most difficult games I've ever played.\\xa0 Despite being really difficult, it was one of the most gorgeous looking, and best playing games I've ever seen on the Xbox. With that said, there's a lot\\xa0 of anticipation and excitement for the sequel. For the most part, NInja Gaiden II is a good game, but it's has some issues that prevent it from being the awesome game that it could have been.There's a story for Ninja Gaiden II, but like the first game, it doesn't really make any sense. If my mind serves me correctly, it involves this statue that's located in the Hayabusa village (that village never seems to get a break), is stolen by a group of fiends, led by Genshin and Elizabeta, to awaken a ancient evil (Sounds pretty stupid huh?). It's just an excuse to send Ryu Hayabusta, the hero from the first game, to different places around the world. While this may not be an issue for some gamers, it's stupid that the story isn't structured well and doesn't really give incentive to players that play\\xa0 games for the story to find out what happened next. But, you do see a chick with big boobs in the game and a naked woman (just eye candy for some adolescent boys).Then again, the reason to play this game is the action. Just like Ninja Gaiden, the action is fast, fluid, and smooth. It has been raised up a notch from the first game. The biggest addition, visually,\\xa0 is dismemberment. Just slicing up body parts of your enemies is awesome to watch and watching blood splatter everywhere. One thing to consider, just because you sliced off their arms or legs, doesn't mean they're dead. The enemies will put up a fight and try to take you down. The other change is the health system, which works differently than the last game. Health has two colours, red and blue. Blue represents you current health and red is permanent damage. If you can get out of the action, or finish a battle, your health will restore up to the red. Your health will restore completely when you save your game, which are more frequent now. The game also saves before a boss fight, so you don't have to worry about playing a section again before getting to the boss.With that said, don't take that as being easy. This game is still difficult. There are two difficulty settings when you start off: Path of the Acolyte, and Path of the Warrior. The acolyte difficulty feels easier than it should be. Enemies are fairly easy to take down and boss battles can be beaten by using the same techniques over and over again. The warrior difficulty feels like the hard mode from the first Ninja Gaiden. The game is much more ruthless and, at a few points, really challenging. After you finish the game you'll unlock two more difficulties. However, the difficulty does feel unbalanced in a few areas, specifically in the middle section. That point the game becomes cheap, which the first game didn't do as much.Another change is bosses. There are a lot of them now, and they vary from great to terrible. Some boss battles are fun to fight, such as in a arena. There are a few that are hard, and one that is cheap. That boss (SPOILER), after you take him down, he will explode and take you with him. There's one boss that you battle four times, which is repetitive and seems that the developers couldn't think of any other interesting end level boss fights. While more boss fights are great, and I'm all for it for the challenge, make the battles balanced. In terms of presentation, the game looks good, but isn't much of an advancement from the first Ninja Gaiden. The character models still look impressive and dismember well. The animations are still sharp, but seem to skip once in a while. The blood, while good and excessive, is flat and static. This is most evident when you see a blood splatter on the edge of a wall or floor. It just sits there floating, that's not very impressive. The environments are varied from beautiful, to just downright ugly. The camera in the game has been changed in this game, and it isn't very good. The camera has a tendency to get stuck in places and focuses at the wrong places. This is most evident in tight corridors. Another unusual issue the frame rate, which tends to drop when there are a lot of enemies or effects going on. This wasn't an issue in the first game, so it sticks out here.The audio is good, but nothing to write home about. The voice work is decent and comes with the choice of English and Japanese track. The music is decent and does a good job of getting you in the action. Sound effects if forceful and effective. The connection of blade to flesh just sounds so good, it scary. Final Opinion: Now, with all that said, Ninja Gaiden II is a good game. But compared to it's competitor, Devil May Cry 4, this game is just harder. If you were a fan of the first game, you will have fun with this one. If you're new to the series, proceed with some caution.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'On the off chance that you don\\'t already know, Medal of Honor is the World War II first person shooter developed by EA. In its long running history, this franchise has seen its high points and its low points in its nearly 10 year, 10+ title life-cycle. Medal of Honor: Vanguard continues the well-established framework and plays out much as you would expect it too. Unfortunately, it also shares much in common with its predecessor, European Assault. Though to some this might not be a bad thing, one cannot deny the flaws that seem to be embedded in the tired out gameplay. Through the plethora of available World War II series, one usually finds oneself drawn to one franchise or another. So if you have chosen Medal of Honor as your WWII FPS of choice, then you will get that fix from this installment. The game puts you in the role of (soon to be) Sergeant Keegan as he propels a team from the 82nd Airborne through countless hostile battlefields desperately trying to turn the tide of war. You will get that same system of broad chapters divided up into various missions that has become the norm for the series. Each chapter is accompanied by a nifty black and white video that one would think is real footage from the war. The first drawback of the game is that it is incredibly and unacceptably too short. You can finish this game in the ballpark of 5 to 10 hours depending on how good you are. Basically you can finish it in one sitting and no game should be that short. It isn\\'t so much that its easy, because you can adjust the difficulty, its just that there are four chapters and between 2 and 3 missions in each. That equals out to a short game indeed. But in that short time, you will find all that makes Medal of Honor, well Medal of Honor.The gameplay doesn\\'t change much from the other installments. There are slight changes and improvements but nothing of note worth putting down. Basically you must plow your way through hordes of soldiers by using cover and a heck of a good aim. Most of the time you will be assisted by a group of allies, though they really don\\'t do much in the way of assisting. They have a terrible shot so most of the mowing down must come from you. They do shout out enemy positions and give some advice for taking cover, but this isn\\'t all together that useful anyways so if all else fails they make good cover. Along the way you will become intimately acquainted with what MG42s and Tigers are if you don\\'t already know. There is a vary limited number of different weapons available and only one is customized by means of adding a scope to it and that is very late in the game. All the shortcomings aside, Vanguard delivers a shooter experience that you would expect and tells a good tale, even if it is a short one.The one real shining spot for the game, and this has been the shining spot in the series, is the music. It just simply does an incredible job of making it feel more like a motion picture experience then just a video game. All in all, the sound in general does a good job. Everything from the firing of weapons to the shouts of your comrades sound great and really do well to put you in the scene. Though the sound f x themselves hardly redefine the genre, the music is always an exceptional score and does much to add to your experience. Though it doesn\\'t do what Frontline did for the series back in the day, it is a Medal of Honor game through and through. You will get what you expect from the game and even though it is short, you will finish the game feeling satisfied. If you are one of the series loyal legionnaires, you will get that one simply exceptional level that always seems to be somewhere in each game. This coupled with the fantastic score makes this yet another iteration in the growing franchise that is Medal of Honor. It proves that this tired out old framework still has some juice left in it. The game receives a 6 out of 10 from my system, which puts it at \"Fun.\" After all, like all good Medal of Honor games, you won\\'t have to wait to long for the price to fall to the very attractive 19.99 point, and what else can you buy that is as satisfying as a WWII shooter for 20 bucks?

       " {'deck': 'Burnout has evolved massively',\n",
       "  'description': 'The Burnout series has always been about one thing: pushing your limits while driving in traffic with your engine spitting out nitro. This time around, it\\'s about making your opponents crash. When you for example push an opponent to the front of a bus, \"BUS TAKEDOWN\" will pop up on your screen while you see your opponents car being smashed in slow-motion. However the camera will for a couple of seconds not concentrate on your car, but your opponents car. If you were to crash in a wall before the camera switched angle, your car would just park with its nose against the wall. This can also happen if you were heading straight to the front of a vehicle. But if you were going fast enough, the vehicle would take off on your hood as if you were a moving ramp. This is incredibly cool and definitely makes you feel extremely lucky.  But if you do crash, you can pull of a trick called \"aftertouch\". This means that you can steer your car in slow-motion by using your remaining nitro. If you then make an opponent crash into you, you\\'ve done an \"Aftertouch Takedown\". This can also save the section of nitro you\\'ll normally lose, while adding to your total takedowns.  Your amount of nitro is increased by driving like an idiot. Driving in oncoming traffic, drifting, near-misses (barely dodging traffic) and tailing (drafting) are some of the things you can do to add nitro. When you do a takedown, your Nito \"meters\" limit of Nitro is doubled while filling it completely. You can continue this till it\\'s 4 times the size you started with. When you crash you lose the last section of Nitro you gained(from 4x to 3x, 3x to 2x or 2x to 1x).  Being lucky is another thing. It\\'s the main aspect of the game. how you can dodge several big vehicles while drifting in an corner, for example, or managing to press your car under a huge semi-trailer while crossing a junction because an opponent crashed in it before you so the semi-trailer lifted a couple of centimeters above ground. Stuff like that...  Another thing is the \"Signature Takedowns\". This is a normal takedown, but you must do it in a special way. If you send an opponent flying near luxury boats in the Vineyard, you\\'ll get an Signature Takedown called \"Berth Trauma\". There\\'s 20 Signature Takedowns in the game, and by doing all of these you\\'ll unlock an NASCAR-looking car.  There\\'s a total of 67 cars in the game. These are divided into different series. You\\'ll start off with a Compact car. As you progress in the game you\\'ll unlock more Compact cars and eventually unlock the next series. This continues until you\\'ve unlocked the Super cars and some of the Special cars. The special cars are cars that don\\'t fit in a series. Two of these are taken from Burnout 2, three are F1 racers(although one has different design). and then there\\'s the NASCAR-looking car. There\\'s another series, but it\\'s only for Crash events.  Crash events are even more crazy and fun then in Burnout and Burnout 2. In Burnout 3 there\\'s several symbols you can collect. These range from Instant Boost to 2x Multiplier to Heartbreaker (your score is cut in half) to 4x Multiplier. Head into traffic and cause as much damage you can. Yet another thing is the \"Chrashbreaker\". When enough vehicles are impacted in the Crash, an single button will make a bomb go of in your car, causing damage to vehicles around you. The Crashbreaker is also an collectable symbol. There\\'s a massive 100 Crash events in the game. Causing enough damage unlocks cars in the Heavyweight series. These cars range from a 4x4 to the extreme Fire Truck, which can be obtained by winning all the 10 headlines. Headlines are won by getting a such a massive score that you get on the frontpage in the local newspaper.  The coolest mode in Burnout 3 is the Road Rage mode. It\\'s not about coming first, but about doing as many Takedowns you can until your car can\\'t continue anymore. Your opponents boost when you boost, and do there best to stay close to you.  The Live functions are great and all you need for a good experience.  The worst thing about the game is the standard soundtrack. Although the Xbox version has Custom Soundtracks, the rest have no other choice but to like the punk music. Unless you like that kind of music, multiplatformers should choose the Xbox version.  The game is great for anyone who want instant fun, or a challenge for those who want to complete the game. It\\'s not as easy as it sounds, but you can always take a brake and have fun in a Single Race. Racing games that claims to be fun, will have trouble beating this racer.',\n",

       " {'deck': \"For A Console RTS, This One Isn't That Bad, Or Maybe It Is\",\n",
       "  'description': 'Star Trek: Conquest may be many things, but an excellent game it is not. In a world of horrible console based RTS games, Bethesda decides they will use their Star Trek license to put forth a game that is unique, but all together unimpressive. Your first clue to this fact might be the price tag. Clocking in at a very attractive 14.99 price point (Unless you ask GameStop who tacks on 5 extra dollars because they love money!) you really can\\'t expect much and the very fact that the game is so ridiculously cheap makes it not really that bad of an offer, even for a sub-par game. For your pennies, you get a nifty sim experience rolled up with a feel of RTS.Calling this title an RTS might be a little generous. In actuality it is more of a, um well let me just describe it for you. The game features two modes: Campaign and Skirmish. Campaign is the main source of fun here in which you take control of one of six factions, Federation, Klingon, Romulan, Cardassian, Dominion, or Breen and pit them against one or all of the rest in a turn based galactic domination style playing experience. This mode is mainly defined by a map with a bunch of planets on it. Everyone takes turns building, moving, and conquering. It\\'s very simple to understand and jump right into. You get money at the beginning of each turn depending on the number of planets and mining facilities that you have. This money is good for constructing star bases, gun fortifications, mining facilities or research facilities. The main thing that will be using up your cash flow however is the fleet construction. Basically you can hire up to three fleet commanders. After ponying up for the commission of the commanders themselves, you then buy up to seven ships for each of their fleets. After you are satisfied with what you have, you go forth and attempt to capture planets and destroy enemy fleets to take control of the entire galaxy. Mining facilities are good for money, but the other option is the research facility. These are handy for two things. The first is the special weapon, which is a choice of constructing one of three items that depends on which race you play as. These can do things such as isolate one planet so that enemy commanders can\\'t get through, healing a system, cutting a system\\'s health down by half. (meaning that any star bases, facilities, or fleets located there lose half their HP) or various other small affects to give you a slight advantage. Secondly, research facilities do research. Each race has five different characteristics that can be upgraded through research. These characteristics can be upgraded a total of three times per characteristic and vary from taking the price of ships down slightly to boosting efficiency on mining or research facilities, to even increasing ship attack power or HP. Both the special weapon and the upgrades take a certain number of turns before they can be used. The number of turns depends completely on the number of research facilities you own. Therefore it is possible to have a special weapon ready for each of your turns.The extra draw for the game lies in the combat mechanic. When your fleet comes across into contact with an enemy fleet or an enemy structure, battle ensues. The battling itself can be done in one of three way: Instant, Sim, or Arcade. Instant is handy if you are confident enough that you will win the battle. Basically the computer randomly decides what happens and the battle is instantly over. Sim is a more traditional form where you see photons fired and phasers shot. This mode adds the ability to have your commanders take an offensive, defensive, or neutral battle plan and has the added ability of withdrawing (only if you initiated the attack) which can be handy so you don\\'t lose your commander\\'s experience, which is reduced to zero when they are completely defeated. Both of these modes pale in comparison to the last mode option, arcade. This puts you in actual command of a ship in a battlefield. You can move, target, fire, and basically free to take control of the battle from the front seat. This mode is very difficult but can be worth it if your good enough. The play experience here isn\\'t all that exciting but it is a nice addition to an otherwise unimaginative gaming atmosphere.All this aside, lets talk about the drawbacks. They are described quite well in one word, limited. Everything is very limited. Each race can only have a maximum of three fleets at any time. That\\'s it! This makes it incredibly time consuming and gives the game more of that give an inch take and inch tug of war feeling. Another limitation is ships construction itself. There are only three classes of ship construction, light, medium and heavy. Also, each planet that you control has only two slots for construction, the first being reserved for either standard or advance star bases, and the second for either a mining facility or research facility and that\\'s it. The gameplay is repetitive, the races don\\'t seem well balanced, and all in all the game just feels like it missed something. However, these drawbacks aside it is a 15 dollar game, perhaps even less by the time you read this. Plus the game is fun, for a little bit at least. So if you want to support 15 dollar games coming out, really if you would rather pay 15 dollars and get a disc in your hands as apposed to paying for a virtual download game, then by all means support this cause. That\\'s why I bought it. Final score is a 6 out of 10 putting it at \"Fun\" but if there was a special achievement for value, Star Trek: Conquest would earn that as well. ',\n",

       "  'description': \"Burnout Paradise is Criterion's 5th Burnout game, and the first built from the ground up for this console generation. It's apparent from the first moment you get behind the wheel, not just from the bump up in graphics, but\\xa0 also the complete lack of loading screens.It's a major change, which requires an adjustment in how you attack the game. The game's much less arcade-like now, taking the fashionable sandbox approach instead. Events appear on your HUD and world map once you discover them at individual locations. Drive up to the traffic lights, pull a doughnut to activate that junction's event and away you go. These range from the standard races and classic Road Rages to the new Marked Man, a point-to-point chase where the rest of the field are out to shut you down before the finish line.No event has a set course, you're given an end point and it's up to you to get there first anyway you can. This can be a problem in the early stages as you slowly learn the layout of Paradise City. A wrong turn can lose you a race, and there's no quick restart option, other than to drive back to the start line. Once you've know your way around this becomes less of a problem, as there are also plenty of handy shortcuts. This has its own downside though, as it further breaks up the pack. One of Burnout's hallmarks is paint-scrapingly close races and frequent takedowns, which are much prevalent here.The other noteable feature has always been the Crash Junction, a welcome change of pace which still kept the carnage levels up. This was almost a puzzle mini-game in previous games, with a set junction, vehicle and target score. In Paradise this has become Showtime mode, where you can flip your car out at any time to rack up a score. These wrecks can be extended almost indefintely, but with no set target score it feels a little pointless.None of this is enough to spoil what is still one of the best racing franchises around, though. If you fail one event there are always plenty of other events (or cars) to try, and no other game gives the same feeling of sheer speed. Online races are smooth and easy to access in-real time fron the d-pad. As ever Burnout is deeper than it appears and rewards even after weeks of play.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'So just to start i am a huge Dragonball z fan, as it was the first Anime that i ever saw back when it was first shown on Cartoon Network but this Burst Limit review will not be swaided by that fact like alot of these other reviews have.  So on to the Review!!!  People seem to compare this game with Budokai 3 alot for some reason, even after playing it, this is wrong as it shouldn\\'t be compared with 3 but with Budokai 1.  I\\'m proberly right in guessing that if your reading ( or have read ) this review then you are interested in some form in either Dragonball z itself or fighting games. Well... First off Dragonball z Burst Limit for the Xbox 360/PS3 is a Primary fighting game, and a good one at that.  Now unlike the past few DBZ games, Burst Limit return to the Budokai formula of fighting as the camera is places further out and not behind your character like the Tenkaichi series, and just like the Budokai series the game focuses more on strict fighting instead of collecting capsules and Dragon Balls for your character. After completing story sequences, you unlock certain items such as characters, abilities and battle stages. Combat has been simplified dramatically from the previous games. Using special moves is as easy as pressing a button and moving the left analog stick or d-pad simultaneously. If certain actions are made during the battle, \"Drama Pieces\" are activated, causing many different effects such as having your health restored with a Senzu Bean and a helper character attacking your opponent.  Now these \\'\\' Drama Pieces \\'\\' are what i would call a \\'\\' double edged sword \\'\\' for the sheer fact that when you first play the game and activate one of these Drama pieces, it looks cool thanks to the great Animation ( exept the mouths that keep moving after the dialogue has been said ) and core graphics, but after completing the game you would of most proberly unlocked 80% of these Drama pieces which means you can use them if equipped to your character in fights online or against friends, thats good and everything, until you have seen and activated the same Drama piece OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN, which again would be fine......  IF YOU COULD SKIP THEM !!!!!!!!!!!!  Although implemented fairly well these Drama Pieces turn from being a great addition to being a hindrance during gameplay and although what alot of reviews said is true in the way that \\'\\' They dont really determine who wins \\'\\' it still fells rather disjointed enough to make the game abit of a chore.  Now aswell as noticing these unlocked Drama pieces during the story who\\'ll also notice the story itself fell abit ( or hugely ) disjointed from pretty much the previous animation scene... E.G. in one particular scene Goku fights freiza for a while and finally comes to a desition that the only course of action would be to use the Spirit Bomb, only a second after Goku saying this the Scene jumps to Goku Firing it ......  So what happened to Gohan , Krillin, and piccolo fighting freiza long enough for Goku to gather enough energy? Makes me wonder if anyone from Atari even watched the Anime or if they just saw bits of it during Adverts.  Anothering thing as well as skipping fights altogether, \\'\\' What if \\'\\' fights have been added ( For some stupid reason ) one of these \\'\\' what if \\'\\' fights include Bardock fighting all of the main Z fighters until he fights Goku. Now i cant really complain about the core game play, but why in the hell skip important fights that were really in the anime and put in this crap?  Also within the story mode you will unlock all 20 or so of the fighters within Dragonball z Burst Limit, for this ive heard both arguments... \\'\\' ONLY 20 CHARACTERS?... THATS **** \\'\\'and\\' There may be only 20 characters but they all play differently now \\'\\'I have found out that both of these statements are utter crap. Yes I\\'ll admit the hand to hand combat is different for around 17 characters but the special attacks are something far different.... E.G. Yamcha, Goku, Krillin and Gohan all have the same special attack, the KAMEHAMEHA! So how can every character play differently if they each have the same DAMN ATTACK.Of course aswell as the stroy mode Burst Limit offers a few other features for you to pretty much waste your time in, these features are:  Survival Mode: A mode where you keep fighting opponents ( 100 ) as long as your health lasts.  Time Attack Mode: A mode where you fight a specific set of opponents and try to beat them as quickly as possible.  Battle Point Mode: A mode where you fight a specific set of opponents and try to score as many points as possible.  Now apart from some good leaderboard options to see who has the best in each mode, these are pretty terrible for 3 main reasons:  1. There all pretty much the same thing but one with a set of health, another with time and the last with a point average.  2. As there is 100 opponents on the survival Mode and only 20 character within the game its highly repeatitive.  3. Unskipable Drama Pieces Oh not only does Burst Limit screw you over with content but it also screws you over with it\\'s online ( from my point of view anyway ) as just like Gamespot stated in there review it\\'s core online feature is 1 Vs. 1 fighting, which it good and all considering alot of fighting games only have this feature, but what makes it far worse than them games would be the LAG during fights, if your opponent is across sea\\'s... So be Warned....  Overall Dragonball Z Burst Limit IS a good fighter, with improved Graphics and gameplay but where it shines brightly in Flash and flair it seriously lacks in substance, so much so that it feels this game is the first DBZ ever on consoles, However if you are like me a fighting game fan and a dbz fan you will get a few kicks out of this.  The Good:  Nice visuals Drama pieces start off being a nice touch easy learning curve  The Bad:  not worth the £40 i payed depends on whether you like Eng Dub Drama Pieces annoy you after a period  The Ugly:Online suffers from relentless Lag \\t\\t  \\t\\t   ',\n",

       "  'description': \"Infinity Ward has finished with the World War II era and has finally embraced a modern twist. The game brings the superb gameplay of past Call of Duty games and throws in a crazy blend of more technologically advanced weaponry and a new refined story to match-- and it works extremely well.  Call of Duty 4 has one of the most interesting singe-player campaigns in a FPS. The single-player will put you in the shoes of a British S.A.S soldier and a American Marine, each with their own story where shocking events will arise along with some seriously jaw-dropping moments. The campaign will leave you out of breadth from the very start to the very end--no matter how short it may be. The campaign is frustratingly short for such an excellent story, most gamers accustomed to FPS will be able to compete the campaign in around five hours on the easier difficulty. Needless to say, the action and gameplay make the short campaign a very enjoyable experience.  The gameplay in Call of Duty 4 is very much like previous Call of Duty games. You have a compass at the bottom left of the screen with objectives marked and you must make your way to these objectives with your AI controlled comrades. Something Call of Duty 4 does very well is your interactivity with your team, each man has their own personality and will offer tactical information on enemy positions and help you in completing your objectives. Your objectives will take you deep into enemy territory in the Middle-East repelling rebel ambushes and to the cold of Russia partaking in Special Ops missions. Even though the campaign is painstakingly short, you'll not want the experience to end there.  However the excellent multiplayer certainly makes up for the lack of singleplayer action. Up to 18 players can get into a match on one of 16 equally different maps varying for a more sniper-friendly landscape to wild grenade pounding and manic shooting maps. There are also six game maps to choose from. There is the familiar team death match and free-for-all deathmatch, also the more objective orientated maps like headquarters. Call of Duty 4 also gives players the choice to tackle more hardcore modes like disabling the HUD but making weapons more powerful-- if you dare to try these modes.  The multiplayer adds more tactical abilities for the skilled players among you. For three kills you will be granted UAV support which will highlight all enemy position on your HUD, for 5 kills you will receive an airstrike on any position on the map, and finally if you reach a seven kill streak without dying you will receive helicopter support for a period of time. This helicopter is AI controlled but will circle the map shooting down any enemies it comes into contact with, though enemies can shoot it down but it will take a fair beating before it does. All these add a little more variety to online play and gives you some rewards for owning the battlefield.  Playing the multiplayer does not go without rewards. Every time you get a kill, capture an objective, call in air support and completing challenges gives you experience which will help you to rise up the military ranks in multiplayer. Ranking up will unlock various weapons and challenges to complete which will help you gain a lot of XP points to go toward ranking up.  The class feature on Call of Duty 4 is also very interesting. Each class has their own pros and cons, much like the classes in Call of Duty 3. However Infinity Ward have evolved this and added perks to these classes which offer some variety to them. As you rank up you will have the ability to create your own class. This allows you to pick your primary weapon, your sidearm, weapon attachments, what grenades you carry and 3 perks. The perks are split into 3 categories to which you can choose and you can unlock more perks as you rank higher. This system gives some variety to the game as no player rarely has the exact same character and offers a wide variety to create a class which suits your style of play.  The perks system is very customisable. Perk number 1 is orientated around explosives, letting you choose from RPGs, claymores and even more frag or flashbang grenades. The other perks are more miscellaneous, but never-the-less important. They include cool things like increased ammunition, the ability to hold your breadth longer when sniping and dropping a live grenades as you die. The different perks vary for what ever tactics you choose to opt for but is great fun mixing and matching between each perk.  Not only does Call of Duty 4 have an exciting singleplayer and multiplayer, but it also has top class graphics. Levels are beautifully rendered, especially those in the Middle-East and effects such as explosions and smoke are superbly crafted to near perfection. Even the multiplayer maps are stunning and full of life-- or what was left of it. The sound value of Call of Duty 4 is also top-notch. Guns sound crisp and realistically terrifying, explosions are also equally scary and you really feel like you're in the middle of a battle, fighting for your life. The voice acting is great too from the humorous banter of your squad in the cutscenes to the serious cries of communication during gameplay.  Call of Duty 4 is an excellent FPS with a superb, but speedy singleplayer campaign, however the multiplayer is where the heart of the game is. It offers plenty of choice and is a lot of fun to play from exciting modes and maps which will keep you entertained for a very long time to come.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'I would like to start off by saying that I really respect Epic Games when it comes to producing value for money games for all of us. They are amongst a small group of developers that really put their heart and soul into everything they release and it shows with Unreal Tournament 3.UT3 is all about action packed, fast combat with jaw dropping visuals and killer sound to boot. The visuals in UT3 are fantastic and the game runs at a blistering framerate with no slowdown to be found even in the heaviest of battles.From the character models to the stunning battle grounds, UT3 looks the part from all angles. The weapons although not realistic feel great and are so accurate that every other developer (besides Activision) should study this game and take notes on how to make a first person shooter.Unreal Tournament has never been known for its story and UT3 is no exception. The story is shocking, you will find yourself skipping the majority of this as I did, it just does not have any weight at all, pity.Where UT3 shines is in its gameplay and more specifically in Multiplayer! Multiplayer action is fantastic. Once you find yourself a good ping and a good group of people online, you will have a blast. There are a heap of multiplayer modes to choose from but from what I have played it looks like team deathmatch is the most popular.The sound in UT3 is very good although the comments made by other players like “yeah, take that!” do get a little annoying after a while.If you’re after a shooter that is hardcore in nature but easy to pick up and play, this is the game for you.Gameplay = 8.5Visuals = 8.5Sound = 7.5Game Now Score = 8.3/10http://gamenowsleeplater.blogspot.com/2008/07/unreal-tournament-3-review.html',\n",

       "  'description': \"Ok to start Gears Of War is an amazing game. If your not easily offended and don't have it already go out and buy it because you will not be disappointed.  For those who don't know Gears Of War is a third person shooter from Epic; who are best known for FPS's like Unreal Tournament. The game is set on another planet where humans have colonised and a load of aliens called the Locusts have invaded. The game takes place years after emergence day which is when the Locusts first invaded. The story is pretty much non-existent. Nothing really happens and the ending is surprisingly unsatisfying. That said Gears of War still has a great premise and interesting characters in which Epic can develop in the future.  Gears of War is very different from other first person shooters in the way that when your running around you don't get a crosshair, you have to press the Left Trigger in to aim up which is perfect because about 80% of the game you will be diving around behind cover, shooting over it and going from one cover to the next. This adds to the intensity of the firefights. The animations for this all look amazing but the downside is that all of the rolling/diving actions and going behind cover are all mapped to the A button. This means that you will from time to time accidently roll somewhere when you didn't mean to but this doesnt really matter. The guns in the game are incredible and pack a lot of punch. The coolest by far is the standard assualt rifle with a chainsaw bayonet. You rev up your chainsaw by holding B then run over to someone and by doing so allows you to drive the chainsaw straight through the middle of your foes in an amazing display of blood and gore. This never gets old.  The sound effects in the game are great especially the chainsaw and you really feel that your firing a high powered weapon. The music is fairly atmospheric and works very well but it is not at all memorable.  The graphics in Gears Of War are quite possibly the best graphics ever seen in a video game. They look stunning but this comes at a price. You will not be able to explore your surroundings and you often feel like the game is like walking down an never-ending alleyway because you can only go one way through nearly the entire game. There are a couple of exceptions where you will have to split up with your team but these are very rare.  Gears of War also has a great Co-op element to it where you and a friend can play the entire single player game Co-op over xbox live. It could well be better than playing single player because of being able to revive each other but the Co-op also comes at a price. When playing through the numerous times on each difficulty I noticed a large amount of glitches. This is most likely because the Co-op was rushed to get the game out before Christmas but there were quite a few times where i couldnt get behind cover and died or when climbing over cover i got moved somewhere across the map and died, but that was very rare.  Gears of War isn't a very long game which is a great shame. There are however 3 difficulty settings, Casual, Hardcore and Insane. After playing through on Casual and Hardcore i had just about got everything in the game so i was able to complete Insane in one sitting. On average the story would probably take you 6-10 hours the first time you play but you will want to play through it again on the harder difficulties. After that theres the multiplayer. The multiplayer aspect of Gears of War is one of the games major strong points. The game modes are pretty much variations of team deathmatch but the maps are designed perfectly for 8 players so that the games are always intense and always fun.  Gears of War may not be the best game of all time but it comes very close and is a flag ship title for the Xbox 360. There are some problems with Gears of War but every single one can be overlooked because of it's amazing presentation and superb gameplay. If you own a Xbox 360 you need this game in your collection.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Solid (Old) Snake is back in MGS4 in what will be his final mission.   I want to clear up something right from the start, this game is amazing, however it is not a game for everyone.  Visually MGS4 is easily one of the most beautifully rendered games you have ever seen. From the impressive player models to the attention to detail in all the locations you will get to explore, much love has been put into this title and it shows.  The story is complicated, so complicated that the final cutscene is over 1 hour long. The cinematic cutscenes although long are beautiful, and for the most part interesting. The story towards the end does get a little confusing and if your not a Metal Gear loyalist, you may feel a little left out.  Level design is linear, although the programmers have done a brilliant job in making the MGS4 world feel epic in every way. You will get to explore many different locations around the world, all as visually stunning as the other.  The sound in MGS4 is also fantastic and sounds great in 5.1 The voice acting is spot on and the acting in general is of the highest quality.  What are the flaws you may ask?  The first half of the game is fairly action packed with many great action sequences. The second half of the game however you will get to play less and watch more. It is packed with cut scenes. The question you have to ask yourself is whether your prepared for such an experience.  Snake’s actual game speed is fairly slow, yes its a stealth based game however I would have like to see him move a little faster. The game plays out more like an interactive movie than a full on game. I don't mind the breaks but some people may find it frustrating. There are also constant interruptions to the gameplay with short loading screens. They are short (8 or 9 seconds) however they tend to get a little annoying.  People are talking this up to be the greatest game of all time, well let me tell you, it's not. This is easily the best the PS3 has to offer and if people were waiting for that killer title to drop, this is it! Take care Snake, it's been fun\",\n",

       "  'description': \"When Capcom's Lost Planet hit the shelves, I was one of the first to buy it. While I was not disappointed with its pretty graphics and abundance of aliens to kill, its tangled and uninteresting story makes it a pretty mediocre game. h are in essence mechanised suits that your character can climb into and dish out a whole load of firepower in the form of chain-guns to devastating grenade launchers. These suits are an imperative part of the game and in destroying some of the more hardy Akrid creatures that your machine gun just cannot kill.  While the game has some gargantuan monsters to face, there are also the smaller Akrid. The weaker Akrid are more commonly found as you progress through a level and usually emerge through noticeable spawn alien-like pumping stations which will continually pump out these smaller aliens until you destroy it. By killing the Akrid, you can gain thermal energy from their carcasses which are used to replenish your health keep you alive in harsh planetary conditions. As you play through the game this energy is continuously drained until you eventually die. This energy drain is an instant concept but from playing through the game on various difficulties you will rarely have to worry about it on the easier difficulties as it is so easy to get your hands on.  Graphically, the game is excellent and the game is not always played out on snowy plains. The level design is also great and most levels aren't too linear and offer a bit of exploration with the aid of your grapple hook which can be used to grapple onto ledges or rappet down to areas below. The levels are also pretty varied as on occasions, you may find yourself in vast concrete-slabbed complexes, in rocky mountainous regions and in what appears to be abandoned cities. There are also various storage containers, barrels and machines which can be blown up which creates some beautifully crafted explosions. Overall the game's graphically and visually superb.  The game also has plenty of weaponry to use ranging from the standard assault rifle to varied guns like a plasma gun. You can also pick up the Vital Suit weapons which wield devastating attacks but severely hinders your movement. The weapons also sound great to from the pulsating rounds of the assault rifle to the huge explosions created by the grenade launchers. Not only do the weapons sound great but everything else sounds excellent from the screeching cries of the Akrid to the crunching noise made from walking in the snow. Everything sounds as it should on Lost Planet.  The online portion of the game is also pretty good. You can fight it out on several different maps that are spacious and look and supports up to 16 players in four game modes ranging from Team Battle to Data Post Grab (capture the flag). There is also a basic level system so buy playing games you can increase your level, while it bears no real rewards, it is an incentive to keep playing.  Lost Planet is an action-packed game which will provide you with plenty of fun and excitement. While the singleplayer is a short ride, it makes up for it in an enthralling multiplayer mode that will offer you plenty of enjoyment out of a game that is a lot of fun to play, overall.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Steve Purcell's Sam & Max: Freelance Police franchise has taken many forms: first as an independent comic series, then as a LucasArts adventure game, and then as a Saturday morning cartoon show. When LucasArts announced the cancellation of the second Sam & Max adventure game in 2003, the myriad fans of the series despaired, fearing we had seen the last of Sam & Max.  Enter Telltale Games with a new creative team, a new format (episodic content), and new depth for the series... literally, since this new game was to be in 3-D. As a fan of the original game (Sam & Max Hit the Road), my expectations for the game were high, perhaps higher than was reasonable - however, I also expected somewhat to be disappointed.  I expected the game to be funny, first and foremost, with not only the zany, implausible logic puzzles comic adventure games of the genre are prone to (see: Monkey Island), but verbal humor ranging from the base and tawdry to the pseudophilosophical and witty. I expected the puzzles to be challenging, but the logic to be coherent. I expected that, at least, the characters of Sam and Max would be interesting.  I got way more than I ever could have hoped for.  If your favorite character from Friends was Chandler, or your favorite Python was Eric Idle, this game has got a vault filled to bursting's worth of humor for you. The dialogue is always interesting, and you'll never want to just look for the most efficient way through a conversation - the game makes you want to explore every single conversation option, every single time. Not only are Sam and Max interesting, but the recurring characters are funny and have a certain amount of depth... you won't grow tired of seeing them.  Many adventure games can absolutely fall apart because of their puzzles, either by making them too easy or too hard. If you are bound and determined to finish the game without a walkthrough, expect to have about one point of frustration per episode (Out of the six episodes, I completed one without help), but even in these instances, the logic is sound and coherent, and you don't feel cheated when you figure out the solution.  If there is one complaint about this game, it is that it is too short. Each episode provides about 1.5-2.5 hours of gameplay, and this series cries out for a complete 20 hour experience. The silver lining around this cloud is that Season 2 is ready to begin this fall - still, had there been more content, this game would easily have earned a perfect score in my book. This genre is not for everyone, and hasn't seen a worthy comic entry since 2000, maybe even 1997, but this game is easily the most recommendable game the series has ever seen.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"So Burnout Paradise, the newest edition into the series for the Xbox 360 / PS3 and soon to be windows platforms.  Ok to jump right into the review if your reading this you've proberly played any of the 5 or 6 games that are in the series which means your wondering, exactly how does this stack up to the rest...?  Well if you are you'll be glad to know that Burnout paradise is by far the best game in the series, bar only a few quarks here and there. As soon as you pop the game in you'll be greeted by the great looking start Menu that is playing... of course Paradise City ( the Guns and Roses song ), However this is where the great Soundtrack ends as through out the game the differed music is pretty much terrible for the most part.  As well as the sound track or even before that when you get in game you'll notice an array of different colour and spectacular visuals that is proberly the best around in any given racing games, also for the most part the Frame rate does stay at a steady 60 FPS with little to no drops even when adventuring online or racing with high speed boosts.  Now after you've gotten past seeing how great the game looks, you'll want to see how great the game plays!! For the most part it's great you can cruise all around paradise city and any speed you like, take any route you like, but this brings up the first and proberly the main Issue the game has and thats the fact that if you have played any previous Burnout Games you WILL find the open world environment the game has extremely overwhelming, this is mainly due to the fact you'll be cruising down a road full speed with boosts on ( trying to win a race ) when all of a sudden '' CRAP !! which way do i turn !! '' so you try too look at your Mini-Radar.. '' Ok so i turn left '' ( You look up ) ''Damn i crashed ! ''.  I myself and friends of mine had this happen to us several times because when your racing you have to do 4 things:  1. Try to win the race  2. Try to avoid oncoming traffic   3. Look which way to go  4. Trying to find the quickest possible route   Now doing these four things is pretty customary after a while and it becomes like second nature EVENTUALLY but as soon as you pick up and play Burnout Paradise doing 4 things in the space of around 3 seconds is alot harder.  Within Burnout Paradise there isnt just racing but altogether 5 different even types these evemt types are:  Race: Races consist of the player and at least 1 other car. The player is given a location to race to. The player can take any route through the city to the location with the aid of a flashing road names at the top of the screen when the player is advised to turn. First one to arrive wins. This is currently the only available mode online. Online races can also include checkpoints that need to be crossed before reaching the finish.   Road Rage: The player is given a target number of takedowns and a time limit. A Road Rage event is won by meeting or exceeding this target in the given time limit.   Marked Man: In this event, the player is given a destination. At least 1 opponent is trying to stop the player from reaching the destination by scoring takedowns against them. The player must survive from start to finish in order to win (the player can be part of collisions, but loses the event if he totals the car).   Stunt Run: Players are given a target score. They must earn points towards that score by using boosts, jumps, drifts and other such stunt moves.   Burning Route: Each Burning Route requires the player to use a specific car. Once the player is driving the required car, they race against the clock to a specified location. When a Burning Route is won the player wins an upgraded version of the vehicle they completed it with. The upgraded vehicle can boast extra boost power, more base speed or a stronger body (but usually in exchange for another category). This is the only kind of event that doesn't reset when the player earns a new license because it's tied to the car used to run it rather than the license level the player is presently at.   Now reading this you may possibly be thinking that '' Road rage must be kinda like crash mode, from Burnout Revenge right? '' ... Well no it isn't, infact there is no crash mode in Burnout Paradise what so ever instead a mode called '' SHOWTIME '' has been added in it's place..  Unlike in previous Burnout games, Crash Mode, now called Showtime, can now be started at any time and place in the game; though Showtime mode is rather different from the usual Crash Mode.  Basically after completing a certain amount of the game ( only like 5 % or so ) the always annoying DJ atomica basically shows you how to activate and do '' showtime mode '' and this is started by driving and crashing into a AI car and just before impact pressing and holding the trigger buttons to activate it, after activation your car starts rolling out of control into other veichles ( this gets you a type of points ). Now to move you simple press A on your controller and the direction in which you want to move, however as soon as your boosts runs out the showtime stops and you return to normal play, the only way to continue showtime is by hitting other cars to regain boosts, that or hitting Busses which add a multipliyer to your score.  As well as singleplayer Burnout Paradise came shipped with Online capability which is very simple to use if you have XBOX LIVE available to you.  Pretty much anytime you like during singleplayer by just pressing one of the directional buttons on your 360 controller and selecting free burn online, the good thing about Burnout Online is that its so quick and simple to use as you choose a free burn session and BOOM... it's loaded.  Also all this is does is bring other players icons onto your radar which is great as there is no loading time and it's as if they have joined in on your single player session rather than the other way around.  Another feature implemented into Burnout Paradise is the new '' MUGSHOT '' option which is pretty funny to you as if you or your opponent has a Xbox vision camera you can see their frustration picture the moment you take them down or beat them in a race. When a player is taken down, they will have their photo taken, called a mugshot, and shown to the aggressor. These photos can then be saved to your hard drive.  Just being able to Free-Roam and race isnt all burnout online as to offer either as there are around 300 unique challenges that you can do with friends of strangers online to unlock certain things.   Overall Burnout Paradise is an outstanding game that newcomers and Fans to the series will find overwhelming at first, but if enough time is put into it, will throughly enjoy and spend many hours playing as its not only a treat for the eyes ( amazingly great visuals ), but for everything ( apart from the sound track XD ).   The Good:  Outstanding visuals Online is pretty easy to get into to  Alot of modes to try out Dozens of cars to unlock   The Bad:  Pretty steep learning Curve as first  The Ugly:  Poor soundtrack over all \",\n",

       "  'description': \"It is not often that a video game blends cinematic flair, eloquent story telling and superb game play into one package. Many great games thrive on the latter while few find a way to excel in all categories. Metal Gear Solid 4 not only meets all of these requirements, it obliterates them without hesitation. Metal Gear Solid 4 is the greatest game I have ever played, period. Snake could not ask for a more fitting sendoff.  As a MGS fan I remember having to listen to the boring codecs between snake and his comrades. They could be skipped but the player would be missing out on vital parts of the story. Hideo Kojima has decided to go in a different direction by telling this epic tale through beautifully rendered real time cut scenes. The story is told so amazingly in this game, I have no problem with watching the cinematics on my now third play through. Some biased reviewers will tell you that cut scenes distract from the experience and that 90% of the experience is a movie. This simply is not true and the cinematics only add to the depth of this game. I will not delve into specifics to avoid spoilers. The story starts off with Solid Snake coming out of retirement to help an old friend, Colonel Campbell, the mission is simple, assassinate Liquid. Things get complicated from there but rest assured, this game grabs onto you and doesn't let go until the credits roll. Every loose end, every missing character anything that has plagued us throughout the Metal Gear series has been answered in MGS4, and in doing so it has raised the bar for story telling across any medium.  Early on during the development Kojima Productions brought in Ryan Payton, one of the heads at Konami of America, in order to bring some western influence. Boy, did it pay off, MGS4 has completely revamped the control scheme while still keeping the stealth elements not only in tact, but have improved upon them immensely. Metal Gear Solid 4 takes in a new over-the-shoulder camera view, Ala gears or re4, and it has opened up a whole new way to play the game. Any worries that this new camera will take away from the core of the stealth game play are invalid, as this adds new depth to the stealth while giving a new opportunity to players as well. The gameplay also stays fresh as it has you traverse through five completely different areas throughout the five acts. Another wrinkle that plays along with the new shooting mechanics is the Drebin Points system. Drebin is a weapons launderer and he unlocks ID-tagged guns that you pick up throughout the game. You will find, steal and swipe guns off of enemies collecting points and weapons throughout the story and with over 77 weapons in the game this adds an extreme amount of depth.  Now for those stealth enthusiasts who thrive on CQC and camouflage, there is another new element, and it is probably the coolest thing I have seen in a video game in a long time. Octocamo is an evolution of the camouflage system from MGS3: Snake Eater. Octocamo blends into whatever surface you are primarily leaning against. This comes to be very handy when trying to avoid enemy soldiers.  In MGS4 there is something for everyone, and this new variety of game play options will only entice players to engage in multiple play throughs. On top of all these new additions, MGS4 has an insane amount of collectibles, warranting at least 2-3 play throughs to unlock everything. As if all of this wasn't enough, Kojima Productions and Konami have decided to build upon the success of Metal Gear Solid 3 Subsistence by including the very underrated Metal Gear Online. My only complaint about MGO is having to create a Konami ID. It plays very similar to the single player game. With about ten hours clocked in, I have had no lag issues or microphone issues. In a word: Solid, no pun intended.  Boss battles have always been a staple of the metal gear franchise and this carnation of the series does not disappoint. The bosses are a wonderful homage to the memorable fights from MGS1. Beautifully designed boss fights fit well into the intricate story and add to the depth of realism that MGS delves into. They give a real taste of the horrors of war and paint a picture of what an atrocity really is. MGS4 sets a new standard for game play, with varied enemies, brilliant AI, and a whole new set of tools at snakes fingertips, its hard not to bask in the glory that is MGS4.  Graphically MGS4 sets a new standard for video games that other developers should learn from. This game is filled with realistic textures and beautifully rendered character models. It offers some amazing lighting along with some nice effects that add to the realism such as the dirt and water that covers the screen in moments of battle. The audio in Metal Gear Solid 4 is second to none, with top notch voice actors and realistic sounding guns, this game has the technical features down pat. The voice work is second to none with David Hayter leading the charge with his wonderful representation of Old Snake. I could discursively drown on about how beautiful this game looks and sounds and it still wouldn't do it justice. It just shows the amount of work Kojima has put in with his team for over three-and-a-half years. Their hard work has payed dividends for this game as it is the most visually stunning console game to date.  Words can not describe what a masterpiece Metal Gear Solid 4 is. You simply have to experience this game for yourself. It is sad to see such a legendary hero as snake go but he could not have asked for a better send off. Goodbye old friend, I salute you.\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'Exciting, Original, Immersive. This is everything Orochi is not,',\n",
       "  'description': \"Koei's Warriors Orochi is a combination of the Dynasty Warrior and Samurai Warriors franchise. While the game may seem like a fresh idea, it is left with the same characters you will find in both games and the same repetitive gameplay you would come to expect from both games.  There are four different campaigns: Shu, Wu, Wei and a campaign revolving around the Samurai Warriors portion. The storylines are all vary, depending on the faction you chose, but the same structure is used for each faction so the missions are very similar. While Omega Force - the developer - has tried add variety to missions such as escorting officers to safety, or infiltrating an enemy camp, it does little to squelch the monotonous feeling after you are on your last campaign.  The gameplay is what you would expect from the other Warrior games. The AI is about as useless as a rotten sack of potatoes and your allies do very little but distract you from your main objective. You can easily pace through the game using on the two attack buttons and using your special Musou attack. A noticeable change in the gameplay is the introduction of the ability to switch your officer to another one in-game. This is achieved through selecting three officers to take into battle in the prebattle menu then in the battle you can switch the officer with the press of the button. While it adds some variety, it does little to save the game's dire gameplay.  In terms of extra content, Warriors Orochi has very little. There is a free mode which allows you to pick a warrior and fight a chosen battle, as well as some extra features such as a gallery, but it remains at that. You can play the story in co-op but it's not more interesting than playing it in single player.  You would expect the emergence of Samurai Warriors in the game that there would be more officers, but there are only 77 in the game. Despite this, it should keep fans of the franchises busy, and for anyone trying to get the easy achievements in the game.  The area which perhaps sets Warriors Orochi apart from the other games are the new customisable weapons feature. This allows you to gather weapons in battles then merge them to improve your weapon further. You can also add add-ons to your weapons to give it fire damage, for example. It isn't much of a revolutionary feature but is a welcome addition to the game and allows you to create some beastly weapons.  In terms of graphics, Warriors Orochi's are very poor. They are of the same quality of past Warriors games like Dynasty Warriors: Empires. To say the graphics are of next-generation standard would be a blatant lie. The character models of the singular warriors are identical, and on screen they can become just a choppy mess. The named officers are slightly better and give an aura of individuality thanks to their colourful and unique design. Other than that, the game is more like a recycled Xbox game.  The sound quality of the game is also unbelievably bad. The script is poorly written and phrases in the game are completely over-used. The voice acting is also abysmal. You would have thought in a game set in medieval China that it would feature some of the Chinese language, however, the Officers have accents similar to those who live in Sussex. Not only that, but the irritating cries of warriors on the battlefield and the 1970s electro soundtrack is enough for you just to mute the game - you might even get some enjoyment out of it that way.  Warriors Orochi is proof that Koei is really just milking the franchise, and perhaps it is time to cut the Warrior franchise and focus on something new. If you are one of the fans of all the other Warriors games, then give it a try, but if not your money is better spent on something more worthwhile.\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'Thrillville Is Entertaining For The Family',\n",
       "  'description': 'Thrillville is a sim game not unlike your basic Roller Coaster Tycoons, or Sim Theme Parks that have set the bar. You fill the role of the Park Manager and busy yourself with countless missions in different parks much like you would expect. The difference is that this game experience is really streamlined for the general audience so you won’t find all that complexity of the other games. All in all however there really is a lot of game depth here for a stand-alone console game. Even though it may lack the clean play of a PC game, it has only minor drawbacks. They even go as far to throw in a party mode that gives this game that extra dynamic it just may need to wind up in your game collection.So at first glance you might find yourself saying, “Yea been there, done that,” right? Well Thrillville may be something of a reiteration of the same old tired idea, it has some crowning attributes which really help it shine on its own. The game starts you out meeting your crazy, mad-scientist uncle Mortimer who happens to excel at theme park design. He is busy developing some new, insane invention of some kind and seems to be having trouble keeping up with his chain of parks. So of course your talents are called upon to bring sanity to the madness. The game starts off by creating your virtual likeliness, which isn’t all together diverse, there is a list of avatars that you get to pick from. Next you are off to your first challenge. There are a total of six parks that you will eventually explore including the tutorial-ized first level.The parks have kind of a different set-up. Your control is quite limited in that you have no direct control over the look of the park. All the parks you play are pre-set with themes, some of which are really neat. So people looking to build the park of their dreams won’t find it here. The parks themselves are further divided into sub-sectioned themes. For example, the first park, Thrillville, has three themed sections to it entitled, Ogreville, Futureville, and Superville. Taking into account that most of the decorations are really pretty cool, the lack of customizability can wear on you. You are however able to get rid of a given decoration by simply building through it. One main facet of any game that falls into this crowed is its coaster builder. This game has a fairly good system for you to work with, but it does limit a lot of your placement. More times then not you will find yourself going out of bounds or too near another attraction. That can get pretty old pretty quick. The first noticeable thing is there is no lift track. Instead all you have to do is create an upward piece of track and the lift mechanic is automatically implied. This proves true on straight track as well so you literally never have to worry about your coasters getting stuck at any point. Also you can’t crash your coasters, because you have very limited control over building, the game won’t let you build anything dangerous or unfinished. It also is a shame for the shuttle loop fans like myself. You just have to keep in mind that the game is mainstreamed for casual gamers.The next major facet of game play is the mini games. Aside from the fact that there is a whole separate mode just for four buddies to sit and play some party games, you can play them in the single player campaign for cash! Each of these mini games should prove to be somewhat familiar to the average gamer. The game works on a mission system. Each park has a certain number of missions that you have to pass before you can move onto the next park. These missions are grouped into different categories that define what the mission is. There are missions for building such as making a coaster that has a certain drop and number of G’s, playing through a mini game to beat a kid’s high score, training staff members, racing people in go karts of mini gold, and more. This mission system is pretty well rounded and you won’t tire of it too quickly. Once you reach a certain number of missions completed, you unlock the next park and are off to another cut scene and another challenge. I suppose it is worth mentioning that there is a loose story line to this but its really not that original.The game really gets frustrating when you try to use the camera. Camera control in the general view as you walk around the park can get glitchy or stuck behind a wall. Sometimes this happens while building a coaster too. The graphics in general can be a bit twitchy when you’re just walking around. Some may argue that the overall difficulty of the game is easy but it isn’t designed for the heavy gamer so in that regard it is probably just right for the pick up and play person. Also, aside from some nice additions to the soundtrack in the background, the game’s music can get a tad old. Some of the mini games feel tacky or unimaginative, really leaving you feeling as if it was a last minute toss together. For example the localized FPS engine for the game is very hard on the controls and there is no way that a casual gamer is going to breeze through some of the later missions pertaining to that mini game. All these things aside the game really isn’t half bad, it has a lot to it and you have the multiplayer mini games too so its not a bad addition to your collection. Just make sure you understand that it’s targeted towards the pick up and play kind of gamer, not the serious one. I gave this game a 7 out of 10, which is “Excellent” on my scale.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Spider-Man: Friend or Foe throws you into the shoes... or leggings of Spider-Man in this far-fetched adventure.  Spider-Man must set out to rescue villains such as Venom and Doc Ock who have been hypnotised by a mysterious mastermind who is using shards from a meteor crash to brainwash an array of Spider-Man's greatest enemies. While you journey through each level, you will encounter enemies called Phantoms who vary in size from the small minions to huge, bulking beasts. These enemies are just a barrier to the occasional boss fight, ranging from Green Goblin to Sandman. Every villain you defeat will reluctantly join you as an ally which makes the game so intriguingly enjoyable to play.  As you play each level, you will choose out of your conquered villains who you want to help you fight through the level as a side-kick. Each villain has individual attributes and moves but you will soon find that they all have similar fighting styles. The AI of your side-kicks is also pretty good. Occasionally they may fall of a cliff face but they will hold their own in a fight and be quite useful when distracting a group of Phantoms while you sort out the large one's. While your side-kick offers some help in fighting Phantoms, in the boss fights you are entirely on your own.  The game's level structure is nothing spectacular, unfortunately. You will arrive at a foreign location like Nepal, where you'll fight Phantoms coded to appear in obviously planned out locations, then face a boss at the end. All levels are incredibly linear where the only differences are the environmental changes of each place. Phantoms will become stronger as you progress through the story and their appearance will change between each location offering some variety to each level.  The game also has some extras to find throughout each level. Each level has DNA Helixes and Keystones to find. DNA helixes offer unlockables and must be collected to obtain the achievements, the Keystones can be used to open a locked door where you fight more Phantoms that will also contribute to getting the achievements, and also unlock further unlockable things. While these unlockable games offer some variety,you will probably find them pretty boring. They are not difficult to find, and you will most likely stumble across them in-game but it does offer a small distraction to the main game.  Contrary to other Spider-Man games, Friend or Foe offers very little in terms of scaling walls and web swinging - you will most likely be on your feet most of the time using your fists, instead of performing the usual high octane stunts. Dying in the game is pretty flawed, too, the only penalty that is received is a small reduction of your tech tokens, which you find from beating enemies or destroying crates. These tokens can be used to upgrade Spider-Man's abilities and your side-kicks'.  The game can be easily wrapped up in around six hours. While the game is short, the combat in the game is pretty fun. A single button can be pressed in quick succession to allow Spider-Man to perform devastating combos with his fists. However, it is Spider-Man's web-based abilities that are the most interesting. His webs allow him to latch on to enemies from afar then spin them round and throw them into other enemies, bury them into the ground, or throw them against cliffs. Eventually, you will be granted the abilities to shoot projectile webs at enemies and wrap enemies in webbing to render them immobile as you progress through the game.  The sound quality in Friend or Foe is also great, particularly the voice acting which does a great job at emphasising the game's playful humour. The graphics in the game is also pretty good. The cartoonish character design is great to look at and each character is made their own by their excellent design and voice work. The developers have also completely cut out any gore or blood for obvious reasons - it's aimed at kids. While this may cut down on the excitement of the game, it makes it safe for children to play it knowing they will not be seeing that kind of thing.  What is most disappointing about the game is its lack of online multiplayer. The game does allow two player co-op during missions so a friend can jump in at a press of a button. While this is a good feature to have, the lack of a solid mulitplayer experience really cuts down on the game's replay value.  If you are looking for a lengthy challenge, your time and money would be better spent elsewhere, but if you are looking for a suitable game for your children or younger siblings, then Spider-Man: Friend or Foe is a suitable alternative if you can get it in at bargain bin price.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Screams of soldiers\\' broken spirits whittle the battlefield… arrows pierce through the skies above and hitting with deadly accuracy. Cavalry ploughs through your broken lines of soldiers. This is Total War and it\\'s never been so much fun.  Creative Assembly is back with another Total War game that focuses on the trails and tribulations of the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, and this game is perhaps their best effort yet.  Rome: Total War is split into two main gameplay components. A campaign map which allows you to control the movements of your armies, the management of your cities and the creation of new units. The second element of the game is 3D battles where you play out battles with hundreds of soldiers fighting one another on a detailed landscape while you manage the advancement of your units. The tactical element to the game is omnipresent as you think about your movements: you do not want to run cavalry into a line of spearman do you?  The game has all the modes you would expect: single player campaign, multiplayer battles, and a prologue campaign for beginners. This is a short campaign that introduces you to the basics of the game. The game differs with past Total War games, so it is not only focused for beginners, but for veterans of the series so the transition to the Imperial Campaign is a whole lot smoother.  You start the Imperial Campaign with the choice of three Roman factions: the Julii, Brutii and Scipii. The additional factions are unlocked for play when you defeat them in the campaign, or just by completing the campaign. Each of the Roman factions are situated in different areas of the Italian peninsula. Each faction therefore has the responsibility of dealing with different factions. The Julii must contend with the hordes of Gauls, Britons and Spaniards. The Scipii will spend most of their time sweating it out in Africa facing the Egyptians and Carthaginians while the Brutii are faced with the challenge of facing the phalanx loving Greeks and Macedonians.  Your primary goal is to expand Rome\\'s glorious empire across the uncivilised world by force or diplomacy. The Senate and Rome itself is a AI-controlled faction that will give you periodic missions like blocking a port or seeking out trade rights. In return for completing these tasks, you will be rewarded with things like cash or units. You position with the Senate and Rome will also increase and as you become more popular with the people the campaign takes a dramatic twist.  Once popularity is gained, you have the opportunity to take Rome and become the Emperor of Rome. This is not an easy step to take, however. Your rival Roman factions are also vying for the prestige of Emperor and will fight you to get there. Managing all your cities, while overcoming relentless sieges and attacks is tough, but is the cost you must pay to become victorious.  The new campaign map has drastically changed from previous games\\'. The new map contains beautifully towering mountains, lush forests and detailed rivers and streams. The map\\'s little details like trade carts journeying down roads and wild animals scattered around also makes the map impressively detailed. Another excellent feature Creative Assembly has added is the ability to engage and enemy on the campaign map, only to see the same terrain in the right places on the 3D battle map. The little details like this is what makes Rome: Total War a winner.  Another notable difference to the campaign map is the removal of the \"game board pieces\" that represented your armies in the previous Total War games. Your armies are represented by soldier icons which are immensely detailed.  The game has also embraced a watered down RPG-type system in relation to your Generals, Governors and family members. Your named characters will gain different traits, both positive and negative. Creative Assembly also added in a few humorous traits that\\'ll make you smile. These traits can be gained through different situations, for example, your General may gain the Confident Commander trait by winning a certain number of battles making him a more prolific commander  The sound quality of the game is also fantastic. The musical score in the campaign is excellent, so good in fact that I soon ran out and got the game\\'s soundtrack. The music stays true to the time period - you won\\'t find any Aerosmith in this game. The sound effects in battle are also perfectly conducted and everything sounds as it should from the clanging of metal to your General\\'s scream of morale boosting wisdom.  For newbies of the series, the game allows the player to assign a whole lot of the gameplay to the AI. If you don\\'t want to manage the economy of all your cities, you can chose to have them auto-managed. Battles also have the option to be automatically resolved which can be helpful if it is a battle you don\\'t particularly fancy playing.  The only thing that stops Rome: Total War from being perfect is a few bugs and minor peeves. Sometimes you may find soldiers in a group facing the wrong way, or clashing units merging for a second. It\\'s nothing a patch can\\'t fix but shouldn\\'t be happening in the first place. While navies have taken a more dominant presence in the game, naval warfare is still automatically resolved, something that is to be changed in the next Total War game.  Despite the tiny flaws Rome: Total War is a must buy for anybody looking for a fresh look at a RTS game. Creative Assembly have created a remarkable game stuffed full of replay value and the ultimate Roman experience.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Unreal Tournament is a crazy game. At first glance you may just see a run of the mill first person shooter, you would be glancing inaccurately however. After it\\'s release back in October of 2000 on the PS2, it quickly gained a reputation of being an overall great gaming experience. Rolling with this momentum, and stable franchise tucked under their belt, the developer decided to branch out into the online world of the internet where they really earned credibility. Any way you slice it, this game delivers. Even though it could never compare graphically, nor does it have multiplayer via online play, it does have hours of gameplay and multi-tap support.When you start playing, you will immediately notice the first problem, if it can be called a problem, the control scheme. Though it does its best to cater to a dual shock, it takes a bit of tweaking, and a lot of playtime, to get used to the weird controls. You may find yourself staying away from the alternate zoom for the sniper rifle for a while, if you go with it at all. At any rate though, it has a solid feel to it and you will find yourself mowing down enemies in no time. The weapons featured, about 12, all handle well and carry with them two modes of fire, primary and alternate. The alternate is more damaging but balanced will with the reload time or accuracy. None of this will matter vary much though because of the tempo the game revolves around which is fast, very fast. At the speed of the game, you really don\\'t notice the overall look of the game. Though it is definitely not up to par with modern FPS, remember that it is all compressed onto a plain old CD. That said it really isn\\'t all that bad either, some of the backdrops are really nice to look at, if you get the chance. Along with a very small pocket of slow down or two, this game really doesn\\'t have very many problems and offers quite a package.You will be blazing through 38 different levels organized in five ladders. The first is your standard free for all deathmatch where the first to a certain number of \"frags\" wins the match. This is followed by domination in which two teams fight for control of certain points on the map. There are usually three points in a map and the more you control the faster your score goes up, as you would imagine first team to reach a certain number is the winner. Then we have capture the flag. For anyone who is not familiar with this regular in the world of multiplayer, your team has a flag and your opposing team has a flag. The objective here is to get through the opponents base, capture their flag, return to your own base and drop it at your flag all without getting killed. Anyone who is killed carrying a flag drops it wherever they are destroyed at, if the matching team gets to it first it is returned automatically, if the opposing team manages to get to it, they pick it up and can continue on to get the point. First team to three points claims victory. Next up we have assault. This truly is an amazing little match type. You have an attacking force and a defending force. The attacking force tries to accomplish a certain objective, or objectives as fast as they can. All the while the defending force if trying to wipe out their efforts. You play the attacking force first, then if successful the roles are reversed and the new attacking force tries to do the same objectives in a shorter amount of time. All of these ladders lead up the ultimate contest: Champion. This is a one on one match-up with the best of the best. There are only four matches each getting consecutively harder, leading to the ultimate fight that takes place on a speeding spaceship in space in low gravity, talk about awesome. So keeping everything in perspective, Unreal Tournament offers quite a lot of gameplay. It will take you at least a few days to get through depending on your skill and the difficulty selection. Along with the support of the multi-tap, you could say this is the best package of its time. If you are a fan of FPS and want something to get you by for a bit this title will satisfy your needs. There really is no down side to it. It received a 9 out of 10 in my rating scale that grants it the honor of being, \"Above and Beyond\" and at the very least worth a play through.  \\xa0',\n",

       "  'description': \"The Total War franchise has always been one of large scale battles with hundreds on soldiers battling for their lives. Medieval 2 is no different to these past Total War games. It also offers so much more.  The campaign of the game is where you will get the most gameplay out of. Not only is it packed full of stuff to do, but it combines turn-based strategy with epic 3D battles that the franchise has made its own. It does take long to get the used to how the game works. You pick a faction to play as - this could be England, Holy Roman Empire or France to begin with, and many more will unlock when you complete the campaign.  You are then thrown into a scale map of Europe, Asia, and eventually, South America. You then take turns moving units around the map, organising your cities and creating units, agents and buildings. This all costs money which has to be carefully administered around your empire. Armies cost money to upkeep, it also costs money to build and create things. Money can be generated through taxation, trade and by occupying more settlements. After your turn your opponents take their move. Creative Assembly have done an excellent job in really making your think, as considerations have to be made with relation to making the Pope happy, for example.  Every aspect of life in the medieval time is taken into consideration. You must focus on tasks from the Pope like a new Holy Crusade to take back the Holy Land, to trading with neighbours and keeping the people in your towns and cities happy. The game really does make you feel like your managing an empire.  The second area of the game is played out through 3D battles where you command your units on a picturesque landscape. If you run a high-end PC then the battle will be all the more smoother and an overall more beautiful experience to watch as you battle it out with your enemies. The controls to you're managing an easy to pick up, and the option to group units together really helps. The 3D battles are also a chance to bring out the inner tactician in you. How have to think about how to defeat your enemy: do you outflank them using light combat; or charge in with your heaving infantry for some intense melee and hope for the best. Even if you're not a master tactician, you can skip these battles at the pop-up menu.  The units in Medieval 2 have also change a lot for the better. It is obvious Creative Assembly has done an astounding job making each unit look and feel individual. Each character model is remotely different - each have different faces and even some hold weapons in different hand. It all just makes the gameplay more believable.  The graphics for the game are also stunning. Armour will glisten in the sunlight and every detail has been considered. You will be able to see the medieval cloth pattern your soldiers are wearing. Even the managerial side of the game has improved graphically from previous games. The land is more detailed and you can clearly see things like land degradation on the map.  The game also features and impressive sound track. Each song is expertly crafted which will make you feel relaxed while managing your armies. In contrast, in the 3D battles, the clanging of metal and yelps from soldiers really makes you feel like you're on a battlefield bearing the forefront of combat.  Along with a divine single player experience, the game also features a customisable battle creator where you choose units to use to fight against and also customisable enemy. There are also a few historical battle that you can play with auto-selected units which is pretty fun. The multiplayer side of the game is restricted only to the 3D battles, but with a huge single player campaign, you may not focus too much on the multiplayer. The multiplayer modes are only limited to last man standing and scored resolution, and they support up to eight players where your primary objective is really just to kill as many guys as you can.  You may need a high powered computer to fully appreciate the game and harness its full experience of its beautiful visuals, but the little world you are watching grow and develop will be satisfying to journey through.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"There is no doubt that Evolution Studios has crafted one of the most visually appealing experiences that PS3 owners will enjoy since the system's launch. The game features persistent terrain details: tyres ripping through mud will leave dents and ribs that will remain for the duration of the race, while the collision of vehicles will leave scattered debris. The game truly is a graphical array of photographic textures; sublime cars sprayed with mud and skidding and grinding through races, and the way mud splatters onto your first- or third-person view all enhance the overall experience.  What is disappointing about MotorStorm is its shallow singleplayer mode. Not only does it have very little volume, but it is paper thin. The basic idea of the game is high octane racing on a total of 8 tracks to beat your opponents. However's across a race's three laps, you'll struggle to remain in first place the whole way through, but the challenge is trying to find the balance of driving well and finding the right route to take. If you find yourself at the back of the pack, navigating among the perilous and often heightened path to a better route may get you level. The move is risky but it is extremely rewarding if it is done successfully.  MotorStorm also features an impressive soundtrack which is suited perfectly for such a crazy racing game. The fast paced music helps to really get you into the game in such a way that will have your heart racing from the start to the finish of the race. The sound effects are also top notch. Engines roar with such ferocity like they are right beside you. The crashes and collisions also sound terrifyingly real and you really feel the impact of two or more crashing cars.  What can be particularly frustrating about the game is the AI unforgiving aggressive behaviour. Your opponents will bash you around quite a bit and if you collide with something, the respawn feature will rob you of speed which will allow opponents to pass you. This may not be a problem for the majority of gamers, but for casual gamers it can be very frustrating when you're in the lead.  Races are also a very frustrating experience at times. Vehicles can go flying at even the slightest bump, particularly with lighter vehicles which may plague you with failures and constant race restarts. You shouldn't be put off by the relative simplicity of the tracks and modes, nor the general slower pace as MotorStorm's use of physics and technical racing is a spectacle to behold.  MotorStorm is also not a party game when friends are round, especially since it doesn't have split-screen multiplayer. The game does have a pretty good multiplayer mode though, with twelve players able to rave at any one time. The multiplayer is an add-on to a short singleplayer, but it is a fun experience to play with little lag and what seems to be a fairly populous online community.  In conclusion MotorStorm's unpredictable nature is vivid in single-player mode and the online gaming community is downright vicious. Despite its lack of content, MotorStorm offers spectacular visuals, sound and an experience that will thrill you to the very bone. \",\n",

       " {'deck': 'If You Ever Wanted To Try A Dynasty Warriors Game, This Is It',\n",
       "  'description': 'You may or may not have played a Dynasty Warriors game by now. If you have you would know the basics of what to expect from this latest installment to the series. If you haven’t, well there really isn’t a real draw for the undecided that sit on the fence. However, I will say this much, if you ever wanted to try your hand at a Dynasty Warriors game, this is the one to do it. This game is the most polished and improved upon game in the series. Even with its lack of the traditional storylines, which is really no big deal, this game delivers on all the faithful fronts, and even goes above and beyond in most cases.The game play is the same basic mechanic as in previous releases in that you have your same hack-n-slash combat through droves of enemies to fulfill certain objectives with a not too shabby 77 different characters to choose from. The three-faction mechanic has survived its incarnation from the sub par Dynasty Warriors: Gundam (Sub par? read my review to find out why!) to make a comeback. You use the same controls, for the most part, as you have come to know and love. With the inclusion of the select button calling your horse (Finally!) The changes are subtle but noticeable, especially the new placement of the zoomed version of the mini map, which has moved down to R3. This is because R2 and L2 have been reserved for switching characters.Switching characters? What is all that nonsense about? No, its true, for the first time in the series, you are able to bring with you three main officers into battle. This is a very interesting and no doubt most dramatic, new twist on the overall way the game is played. It can either be good or bad depending on your taste. The good thing is that you no longer have to choose between your favorites to bring to the fight. They stay out of action until you call upon them via L2 or R2. You can “tag” them in at any point during the mission, unless you are taking damage. The transition between characters is seamless for the most part, pausing only for an instant, so you do have to be somewhat careful when you make the change. The drawback to this new dynamic is that some people may find it cheapens the action. This revamped game play aspect allows the two characters that are not active to “rest” and recover their health and musou gauges. Therefore, you would have to be pretty awful at mashing buttons to fail any of the missions by dying because you can always just run a short distance and switch up your dude, and keep right on chugging. Either way you look at it, it is a neat idea and time will tell if they decide to keep it or trash it.Another new facet is the weapon fusion system. You no longer have to work and work to get a decent weapon, you can merely take a bunch of crappy ones you gain in the early stages and fuse them together increasing your weapon’s overall attack and skill. The skills have a small leveling system built in so two or three of the same skill only takes up one slot while still adding the two or three multiplier. There are caps on the extent of the fusion, which is good or this would really cripple the game’s difficulty. The weapons themselves have slots that you can put attributes into, for example what was once an orb system of elemental items that deal their respective damage is now an attribute you can fuse into your weapon. Other attributes are also what you might expect enhancing range, agility, and other skills as well as the inclusion of some new ones. The whole process is pretty extensive and well planned, though once again some may find that it decreases the overall difficulty of the game.Other enhancements include replacing the item system with an ability system. Characters perform certain side objectives during a mission and are awarded with a new ability. Your team of three all benefit from the abilities that you equip. These are the basic enhancements items that you are used to such as strength boost or increased life gauge even starting the campaign on a horse. These abilities also have an underlying leveling system, the higher the level, the greater the effect as you might expect.The main leveling system for the characters themselves is pretty straightforward. As you go through the level killing foes and vanquishing generals, you gain experience. When you reach a certain number, you level up. The experience is gained in real time so as you play through a bout, you will periodically level up. This system is capped at the appropriate 100 as apposed to the short 10 we have seen before. It is also worth mentioning that at the end of a mission, depending on how well you do at your hacking and slashing, you gain a number of growth points. These are what you have to use in order to fuse your weapons. You may also choose spend these as free experience on any character in the game. So for example you gain 8000 growth points, you can put that all towards making a stronger weapon or, dropping it all on a general that you have yet to use. You can also divide it up in some combination of the two, very handy when you are so close to gaining a level and just need that extra little push. This adds a nice way to maintain a good balance between the strength of all the characters. Once again however, this can take away from the action. Just the fact that you can replay the same levels over and over again with an incredibly strong general and blow all the growth points onto someone you haven’t used can feel pretty cheap when it comes down to it.The two main modes you would expect make their reappearance, but the two player mini games were cut. Story mode is very nicely diverse and features a large multitude of levels to choose from. Free mode is good when you just want to throw some people together and jump right into the thick of it. Everything that you do in free mode is saved so this is a good way to train for those tougher missions. Story mode and free mode are both two-player coop compatible, so you can play with a friend through the whole thing. During a coop game, both players play as the three generals that were picked at the start of the mission, so you can literally be the same person at the same time, another first for the series. Take it for what you will.Even accounting for all the streamlining that has been done, and the ease of the game it is still the best yet. I gave it a 9 out of 10, which puts it at “Above and Beyond” on my scale. If you are iffy on the whole franchise but want to give it a fair shot, this is the one to do it with. Even if you aren’t persuaded to join the movement, you will know that Koei gave it their best chance at swaying you. With the all the improvements this game really delivers some solid entertainment. And if anything else, it is probably the most fun you can get from a new release console game for the price, which is only 39.99 instead of the traditional 49.99.',\n",

       " {'deck': 'Battle for Middle-Earth 2 will satisfy any Lord of the Rings fan.',\n",
       "  'description': \"The Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle-Earth 2 was the first of its kind in the Real-time strategy genre for the Xbox 360. Since then, developers have used the game as a basis to further expand the RTS genre onto the Xbox 360.  The Battle for Middle-Earth games have been a huge success on PC with thousands of Lord of the Rings fans able to play as their favourite armies and take to the battlefield in huge battles. Now EA have released the game for 360 owners, hoping to further expand the game's popularity.  One of people's main concerns over the game was how the control scheme would pan out in the game and overall - it does a pretty good job. EA have come up with a relatively simple way of using the thumbsticks to control the cursor and camera. With the A button you can select a unit, and order an attack on a unit by moving the cursor over the enemy and hitting A. Holding down Left trigger (LT) and hitting A will select all military units on the screen. By holding down the Right trigger (RT) you bring up a small order menu where you can build units if you have selected a building, for example. The controls are rather intuitive and are something more console RTS games are now using.  Battle for Middle-Earth allows you to play as both the good and evil side in a singleplayer campaign that takes place while Frodo and The Fellowship are on their perilous journey to Mordor. The story is well told and you will encounter some noticeable characters that were left out of the film in the game. In the good campaign you will predominantly play as the Elves, Men of the West and Dwarves; and an evil campaign which you will play as Goblins, Orks and Uruk-Hai.  To add to the singleplayer experience, the game has a Skirmish mode that allows you to play the AI on various maps, ranging from Minas Tirith to the mysterious Mirkwood forest. In this mode, you can select any race to play as: Men, Elves, Dwarves, Goblins, Orks or the Uruk-Hai. Each faction has their own strengths and weaknesses, for example Elves have superb archers, whereas Dwarves are slow moving but can pack a punch. No matter who you select to play as, you can select what enemy to play (I can't count the amount of times I relived the scene from Minas Tirith from the movie). You can also select if you want any allies and what difficultly the enemy will play as. Skirmish mode is a nice little add-on and can at least provide some replay value to the game.  There are also some obvious, yet subtle, tactical elements to the gameplay. Cavalry can easy wipe out a band of archers, whereas Uruk-Hai pikeman will clean up any cavalry charge up ahead. Combined with the tactical element to the game, an impressive power ability is featured. As you play through a game, you rack up experience points for killing enemies, and more. With these points you can purchase special powers like healing allied units, and more expensive ones like summoning a ferocious dragon to fight for your side. Certain powers are associated with each faction though, so there is no ability for Elves to summon the Balrog. You also have the ability to summon heroes to lead your soldiers in battle. The heroes at the top of the list, like Gandalf, cost a lot of resources but if looked after, they can dish out a whole load of hurt to an enemy army.  Multiplayer in the game can be an enjoyable experience with modes to cater for everyone's taste. There is the typical skirmish mode which is a free-for-all battle against other opponents with the victor being whoever survives. There is also capture-the-flag, capture-and-hold, and a resource race that can be finished in pretty quick time. Finally, there is Hero mode where a both players are given a hero and you have to fight it out until a player's hero dies. The multiplayer is a lot of fun to play, even with friends, and even now it doesn't take long to get into a decent game.  The visuals of the game are also well worth noting. The game's variable environments look excellent and are very well designed. Units also look fairly detailed and their character models look just how you would expect them too. Each faction also has their own unique look. Elves have a more natural and elegant look with trees incorporated into their buildings, whereas Orks have a more degraded appearance with flimsy, dirty structures. However the game suffers from an almost unbearable frame rate collapse during large scale battles which is quite a disappointment. The audio is also great. Some actors from the films provide voice acting for their roles to give the game a more endorsed feel. The music is also quality, which you would expect due to the films having such beautiful musical scores.  Despite some technical hitches with the game, it still offers a full package of things to do from the singleplayer campaign, skirmish, and online mode. Any fans of Lord of the Rings would enjoy the game's loyalty to the books and a story that is lesser known to people will certainly give you some enjoyment.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"After the enormous commercial success of previous Zelda games, it was only a matter of time before a Zelda game would be developed for Nintendo's DS. The result is a unique and immersive game that will tingle your gaming senses.  While The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass may seem like the same old Zelda game, there is something refreshing about the game that ultimately reinvigorates the series in a brilliant way.  One thing Phantom Hourglass is excellent at doing is making you feel like you are in your own adventure. If you're not making charts, you're picking up clues or jotting down directions via your stylus for later use. It doesn't take much to figure it out, but the illusion is impeccable, and will drive you onward to the next challenge.  The controls for the game have been reformatted for use on the DS. Directing Link to wherever you want to go is as simple as pointing or dragging the stylus in your desired direction. Attacking is as simple as jabbing and slashing your enemies on the screen. The way the controls are applied across the game world to solve puzzles is enthralling in totally new ways. Even the most obvious things - like realising you can activate a switch around the corner by drawing a line for your boomerang to travel along, or blowing into the microphone to put out candles - will put a subtle smile on your face.  The ability to draw on your map is a simple yet effective method to keep track of what you have and haven't done, the order to pull switches, or the best path to take. When you are annotating the map, it efficiently sits on the top screen so it is always on show.  You would expect the game to have shrunken down graphics for the DS but this is not the case with Phantom Hourglass. Despite the game's lack of graphical prowess, the simplistic animations and artistic nature of the game make it outstanding to look at. It may not have graphic you would expect from the PSP, but it offers something colourful and fun.  You don't have to have played Wind Waker to get into Phantom Hourglass's story. The story revolves around Link searching for the mysterious Ghost Ship which has kidnapped Tetra. To find the ship, you must search for clues amongst the six main dungeons, which are alive with puzzles and monsters to battle, along with a boss to destroy at the end of each dungeon. Each boss is different and you have to be resourceful and use your weapons and environment to defeat them and progress.  One of Phantom Hourglass's issue is it's almost stubborn reluctance to let you figure out the quest for yourself. For experienced Zelda players the game may be a bit too easy. The clues are too bold, and the fairy who guides you have a chest full of giveaway tips that it dishes out, and is omnipresent through the game. The illusion of being in an adventure is quickly threatened due to the suppressing need for the game to 'hold your hand' through the experience.  Forgiving these flaws are easy, though, and not just because everything is such a delightful riddle, but because it's just as charming and as humorous as all the other games have been. From when Link extravagantly finds a new important item; from the upbeat music; to when a new fairy friend bounces around you playfully. The whole mood of the game is something that would put a smile on the face of even the grouchiest man.  When the single player is over, you're left to a surprisingly engaging multiplayer game, where a player plays as Link and collects Force Gems and the other plots the path for roaming Phantoms to stop the other player. It may be in a whole other world from the superb singleplayer experience, but it is a fun little add-on to occupy your time.  Even among Nintendo's best games, Phantom Hourglass manages to capture your imagination and catapult you into a quest that you will never forget about anytime soon. It may be over sooner than you expect, but you won't wish that it had lasted longer. You'll wish more games were tuned the way Phantom Hourglass is. This game wasn't made for the DS, but the DS was made for Phantom Hourglass.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Over the last twenty years the Metal Gear series has influenced and changed the action / adventure genre with every new entry in the series. Without it, stealth-action would not exist and story-telling in games would not be what it is today. Metal Gear needed a final chapter fitting of its great legacy and that\\'s exactly what Hideo Kojima has given to it.  From the very beginning you get that special atmosphere only a Metal Gear game can create, starting with the familiar gunshot echo upon selecting a new game from the main menu. For me that has always been the moment when all the hype and expectation of the new MGS game finally comes to fruition. That feeling of, \"this is it. Metal Gear is here.\"  After an install period which lasts around 10 minutes it\\'s go time. During the game\\'s installation you\\'re treated to a real visual showcase of the Old Snake character model up-close and in-engine - your first indication that you\\'ve got something special in your hands. MGS4\\'s character models are so far beyond any other game that its shocking. You also get some typical Kojima comedy, as smoking warnings scroll by in-between the usual video-game health warnings...while Snake stands by puffing away on his trademark cigarettes.So even while the game is installing you\\'re still being entertained. It\\'s worth mentioning the before each new act in the story a further 2 minute install is necessary. In most games this would be pretty intrusive but in MGS4 you\\'ll be glad of the break to take in and absorb all that\\'s been going on.  The visuals in the environments are just as impressive as the character models. Textures have been produced with great realism and in the larger battles the framerate very rarely dips even slightly. There is the odd flat looking texture but a game of this epic scale can be forgiven for that. The level design is slightly \"old-fashioned\" but you\\'ll be so engrossed in what\\'s going on that you\\'ll barely notice.  If you\\'ve played previous games in the saga you\\'ll notice that the controls have been changed considerably. The new button-layout is much more \"western.\" The shooting and camera controls now evoke those made standard in 3rd person shooters like \"Gears of War.\" Actions like Close-Quarters-Combat (CQC) and taking cover have also been streamlined. This makes them much more user-friendly and encourages more use of what, in previous titles, were often unnecessary and ignored additions to the control of Snake.  Once you\\'ve had time to get used to the new and improved controls you\\'ll be introduced to Snake\\'s most important new items, OctoCamo and the Solid Eye. OctoCamo is essentially a high-tech version of MGS3\\'s camouflage mechanics. It allows Snake\\'s sneaking-suit to take on the colour and texture of any surface he presses against, either by going prone or taking cover against an object. It looks great and also removes the biggest issue from MGS3 where you constantly had to pause the game to change camoflages using a menu system. The Solid Eye is an electronic eye-patch, combining binocular, night vision and analytical functions. The last of these allows Snake to see determine the nature of items and enemies in the environment before approaching them.  Determining the nature of enemy soldiers is incredibly important in the new battlefield environments. A key new gameplay mechanic sees Snake infiltrating different areas around the globe in which local militias are battling with Private Military Companies (PMCs). Neither side is truly Snake\\'s enemy as he works towards his own goals in the war-torn regions. However, siding with one or other of the warring factions can help Snake achieve his own objectives. Taking sides is as simple as attacking a PMC or militia soldier during the battles or offering one a useful item to gain their trust. As a result, soldiers who trust Snake will offer him alternative routes and create distractions to aid his progress. It\\'s a mechanic which is very simple to engage with and influence and allows you the freedom to fight in the battles with your chosen side (using the improved shooting controls) or adopt a more traditional stealth-based approach.  If you choose the more \"run and gun\" style of play you\\'ll find it to be much more accessible than in previous MGS games. Some of this is due to the terrific improvements in control, but it\\'s also down to the in-depth weapons customisation in the game. One character you meet early on acts as a weapons wholesaler, offering new weapons as well as upgrades and ammo, for a price. Most weapons offer at least one upgradable part, with many offering 5 or 6 customisable pieces. Considering that there are around 50 weapons in the game this is quite an achievement, overshadowing some recent FPS games like \"Call of Duty 4.\"  Of course, even with all the amazing new things going on in MGS4 there is always going to be one thing in a Metal Gear game which rises above anything any other game can offer. The story.   Metal Gear Solid 4 is quite simply the best piece of story-telling in video-game history. The quality of the writing and direction is better than most Hollywood blockbusters. Cut-scenes flow seamlessly with the gameplay and run beautifully in real-time inside the game engine. Most importantly though, every loose end in the Metal Gear saga is explained and tied-off. I\\'m reluctant to say too much about the story in case I spoil it for anyone yet to finish it. Suffice to say though, that its an emotional roller-coaster and I\\'m certainly not ashamed to say that, as a huge MGS fan, I spent the majority of the finale in tears.  On top of the single-player story you also get \"Metal Gear Online,\" a multiplayer game taking place in the MGS universe. It works well enough and features all the game modes you\\'d expect. However, the emphasis on premium downloadable content and the fact that so many better and more accessible online games exist will prevent it from being anything more than an also-ran. However, this has no detrimental effect on the overall package whatsoever, because no-one will purchase MGS4 with the online content as a priority over the single-player experience and story.  For years Hideo Kojima has been seeking to create his ultimate masterpiece, to fulfil both his own dreams and those of his fans. I can say, very confidently, that he has achieved not only this, but he has also produced comfortably the greatest video game of all time. Never before and probably never again will story and gameplay be so perfectly in tune with one another.   I realised today that, though I thought I was emotional at the game\\'s end because of the story, deep down I had realised that gaming will never again be as good as this. Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of The Patriots is as close to perfect as we are ever going to see.  \"I\\'m no hero. Never was.\" - Solid Snake \\t\\t',\n",

The amount of skill needed to play the game well is so far above that of what you’d find in modern shooters, and playing it at a competitive level resulted in the best years of my gaming life. There was just an electric atmosphere surrounding the community because of how competitive you had to be to even be moderately good at the game and it’s many different facets. High level play resembled a lot of what you’d find in a sport, minus the athleticism of course. \\xa0\\xa0   Players had dedicated positions on the map with defined jobs and\\xa0 A heavy armored player standing near his flag on defense.  responsibilities. It broke down to offense and defense in capture the flag matches, usually with someone dedicated to playing with Heavy Armor and sitting on your team’s flag as a nice brick wall of defense if an enemy player some how got passed the patrolling Light Defense players around the perimeter of your team’s base. Offense was usually broken down into Light Armored players attacking the enemy flag and covering the flag carrier if a player managed to grab it. Heavy Armored players that were on offense cleared the path with mortars and rockets, taking out enemy assets like base turrets and sensors, allowing the light armored players a quick and safe escape after grabbing the flag. Sometimes dedicated midfield players were necessary depending on the map, usually being light armored for quick and low profile attacks on incoming enemy offense.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0A look at the interior of a Blood Eagle base.   Tribes 2 is one of the most influential online multiplayer games ever created.  Coming only years after the first in the    franchise, it made large improvements over it's predecessor in many ways. From  it's unconventional method of movement and travel, to it's vast map designs, weapon and vehicle selections; this game was far ahead of it's time. It      offered the most rich competition environment I've seen to date, and it truly saddens me that the franchise is essentially dead and gone. Though Garage Games who is made up of most of the original staff from Dynamix now owns the IP, hopes of another true sequel to this franchise are still low as Garage Games is a small time indie developer. The next few years should offer a better idea of if they'll ever be able to afford to put out a full retail title again.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0A group of players being transported by the Havok.

Although there are many reasons why this game and the franchise itself never really had the huge user-base it  deserved, I think that the biggest reason was because it was the type of game where there was a very, very clear cut line  between the veterans and the new players.. and it took a lot of time and effort to cross that line from new player into skilled player. That coupled with the fact that the elite pushed so many new players out with an almost cutthroat competitive edge, and of course it doesn't hurt that the developer Dynamix was fired from Sierra shortly after the games      release (which reasons still escape me to this day) and you've got a recipe for a moderate to small sized, but incredibly hardcore fan-base. All in all, what this game offers and the franchise has always offered is unmatched gameplay based on unique skills, and not simply knee-jerk reaction times ala Counterstrike.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0             \\xa0\\xa0 So to finish my review, here's a glimpse at gameplay footage as I really don't believe you can get an idea for what this game is without seeing it in motion.

       "  'description': \" When people left there homes to go to the shops to buy themselves a shiny new ps3 instead of a second house, they had only one game in mind; Resistance Fall of Man. When people thought of ps3's they thought of Resistence Fall of Man, it was as much a part of the launch as the system was itself.The Single-Player campaign nis just the right length and there is a distinguishable differnece between the levels of difficulty so you will never feel that the game is just too hard and it's easy to find what difficulty best suits you. Yet somehow the game always seemed challenging but never me to the point of frustration.The SIngle-Player mode sees you battling Chimera, a strange creature that is a mutation from a human. Fighting your way through different locations across England in order to rid the country of the infestation and after England, hopefully the world. Throughout the course of the game you come across many different types of Chimera, each with their own strenths and weaknesses. Resistance Fall of Man boasts a wide range of different and very unique weapons. Each gun has a primary fire mode and a secondary fire mode so that whatever the situation it seems there is a gun that fits your needs perfectly. The guns are also very innovative and clever in their designs and functions, e.g. the L-11 Dragon is a flamethrower that is perfect for storming bunkers and other enclosed areas but it's secondary fire mode allows you to set traps for enemys by releaseing a cloud of gas and when the Chimera you can shoot a spark into the gas making nicely roasted Chimera (Yum Yum).At the time of the launch Resistance boasted the power of the ps3 brilliantly. Objects reacted to their surroundings and would move realisticly if they were moved by something. As well as this it also looked amazing and no matter what was happening at any time there was no slowdown in the frame-rate.Resistance's multiplayer was as phenomenal as its single player. You could play with up to 39 other people on a map and for those of you who ain't so good with the maths; 1+39= a hell of a lot of players!(It actually equals 40). The levels were massive and each one was unique so you never got too used to certain scenary. The multiplayer also contained all the guns in the single-player mode. Overall Resistance Fall of Man a truly astonishing game that never fails to be enjoyable no matter how often you play it. \",\n",

       "  'description': \"Say what you like about Grand Theft Auto, the game that spawned the open-world genre of video games. Whatever your opinion of it, it did a lot of things interesting enough to spawn plenty of games that imitate the formula.  Crackdown is one of those games, putting you in the character of a bio-enhanced Agent of (wait for it...) the Agency, the umbrella security/military/police force in the world of Pacific City. The Agency has got its hands full with the three gangs that are running rampant in the city, each controlling their own area. Your mission is to take out the Kingpin of each gang, which will cripple them to the point of making it easy to eliminate them. Each Kingpin has Generals that enhance the gang in some way - providing weapons, enhanced vehicles, physical training, and others. Take out the Generals, and the gang becomes easier to deal with - which is important, because the tougher the gang, the less likely you'll even get to look at the Kingpin, much less make the kill.  Your character has five core skills - brawling, shooting, driving, jumping, and blowing stuff up - that can be enhanced. Punching a gang member to death will enhance your brawling skill. Running him over with a car will enhance your driving skill. Since you can't exactly 'jump' an enemy to death, there are 500 'agility orbs' that are hidden around the city (mostly on the rooftops) that will enhance your jumping ability that way. Also hidden in the game are 300 'hidden orbs' that enhance all of your skills.  Aside from killing bad guys, you can also participate in 'rooftop races' which have you jumping from beacon to beacon, trying to get under a set time (rewarded with agility points) and 'road races' which have you driving the game's vehicles from beacon to beacon, trying to get under a set time (rewarded with driving points). Sadly, these added elements of gameplay are not stellar, and are rather clumsy (especially the driving races, which will invariably cause you to run over civilians, which hamper your skill progression).  The combat in the game can be pretty satisfying, however - wandering through a forest, approaching an enemy stronghold, looking for baddies to snipe off before they see you - the process is rather easy and uncomplicated, which is good for this genre of game - Counter-Strike, this isn't.  In the final analysis, the game comes off a bit bland. The story is... well, it isn't, and some of the modes added for variety are clumsy and a bit frustrating. The core of the game is good, though there isn't a lot of it, so while the game is ultimately easy to enjoy, it's also ultimately easy to forget.\",\n",

       " {'deck': \"Assassin's Creed is a stunning game but has some flaws.\",\n",
       "  'description': 'Assassin\\'s Creed offers a unique blend of stunning graphic design, excellent voice acting and a very different, but complex storyline. There is an endless amount to do in the game that will leave you satisfied and hungry for more.   Assassin\\'s Creed follows the tale of Altair, a highly skilled 12th Century assassin and his journey through the Holy Land, during the Crusades. You will encounter different environments in the cities you will visit: Acre, Damascus and Jerusalem. Each city is beautifully designed and rendered which will leave you speechless at how life like the cities are.  Each city is alive with a thriving populace and busy streets. In the cities you will encounter beggars, drunks, town guards and hardy Templar Knights; and of course the people going about their normal business. You must take into account the population when making your move on your target as the population can be your best friend or worst nightmare.  The visual quality of Assassin\\'s Creed is one of its many strengths. Each city is enormous and is your\\'s to explore--though most of the cities are cut down to districts which are unlocked as you progress through the story. Everything is beautifully textured from the ancient pottery to the exquisite rugs and detailed clothing on the citizens. Most walls can be scaled one way or another by Altair and you can jump gracefully from one building to another, and you can leap from high towers into bails of hay when the opportunity arises. This makes gives you an extremely fun alternative to running from the guards in the busy streets--why not take them to the roofs?  Moving around the roofs and in combat is easily mastered by the sleek controls also make the game very fun to play. It seems effortless to cut down guards and just running and climbing is extremely easy to master. Fighting the guards in close combat can be a tempting challenge but it becomes more difficult when you are being pursued by 10 or 15 guards who will encircle you and attack; fleeing from them and using your profound agility can help you fend off the guards, allowing you time to escape to the roofs where they will be no match for your speed.  Assassin\\'s Creed\\'s sound quality is one of the best to date for a game. Everything you will hear adds to the experience of being in a busy city. As you walk the streets, you will hear the cries of endangered citizens, their views on religion and politics, the pleas from desperate beggars and the ramblings of drunks all makes the citizens all the more interesting to interact with. The voice acting is also magnificent, each character is made their own thanks to the fantastic voice actors. Combined with this is a beautiful musical score. The subtle sounds of Middle-Eastern tones and harmonies brings the game to life and provides a unique blend of scores for the different situations that will arise.  The story is what binds the whole game together and makes it unique. The story is in two parts. One is centred around Desmond, descendant of Altair, who has been forcibly kidnapped by a researcher and is placed in a machine called and Animus, which withdraws Altair\\'s memories from Desmond\\'s mind. This is when you will begin to play as Altair, eliminating assassination targets sought by your Creed master. The story can be rather confusing at times and switching back to Desmond can some-what slow the pace of the game. The ending especially leaves you on a cliff hanger which opens doors for a possible sequel that will surely be on the table.  There are an endless amount of tasks to do in the game that will take you away from the main story for a short time. You have the opportunity to rescue citizens being bullied by the guards; you can climb tall towers to get a synchronized view of the cityscape and you can collect various flags which will eventually unlock some achievements. Each will grant you elusive benefits like vigilantes that will grab your pursuing enemies allowing you time to escape. Climbing \"View Points\" will also allow you a bird\\'s eye view of the city and will reveal missions you must do to discover the location of your targets. These varied missions come in the form of eavesdropping on people\\'s conversations, beating information out people and pick pocketing victims for more information on things like your target\\'s position. All of this grants you opportunities to flex you stealth talents by creeping around gathering information on your prey and preparing your strike.  The game also gives you important choices to make: should you go in all knives blazing, or sneak in through the crowds of people and cunningly killing your foe with your hidden blade. You can use your throwing daggers to kill enemies from a distance or use your sword or short sword to kill them in close quarters. Each way has their own satisfying rewards, be it smooth gruesome combo kills or a sneaky knife in the back. Close combat can be risky business as killing innocent citizens will give you a severe loss of health which will hinder your confidence in a large fight.  Needless to say, stealth is your best option. You have the ability to sneak past guards by hiding among white-robed scholars or by blending into the crowd. However, knocking over crate and pot carriers will draw the guard\\'s attention to you and or even drawing your weapon in public will make the guards draw their\\'s in retaliation. This can lead to all sorts of problems whither it be trying to complete a mission or just getting from A to B. You may choose to stay and fight the guards off, but running to the roofs is a far more enjoyable experience as you can throw guards to their deaths from the rooftops or hide in the hay stacks or small gardens located there until the guards regroup and go back to their posts. It all adds to the game\\'s immersive quality.  Assassin\\'s Creed is one of those rare games that portrays how hard Montreal Studios has worked on this game. The graphics, especially in High-Definition are stunning and is the sound quality of the game. From the living and breathing cities, to the slick combat and free running qualities of the game, it provides a deeply satisfying experience that you will soon not forget.',\n",

       " {'deck': 'BioShock is a spine tingling, heartstopping game.',\n",
       "  'description': 'BioShock is a stunning first-person shooter from 2K Games on the surface, but it\\'s so much more when you dig deeper into the game. It is the tale of one man\\'s elusive fantasy which, in turn becomes a secluded city\\'s worst nightmare.  The game begins with a plane crash-- your plane crash-- and your the only survivor among the wreckage. As you float in the sea of the Atlantic you notice a lighthouse is your only hope of salvation, as you enter it, a bathysphere lies in wait for your arrival to take you into Rapture. Rapture itself was once a thriving metropolis, the creation of an idealistic man named Andrew Ryan.  As the city flourished, so did its scientific advancement which resulted in creations people could only dream of outside of Rapture. This creation was plasmids, a genetic modification devise that granted the user incredible abilities. However, the Rapturians were not ready for this advancement and paid a costly price for these abilities. It is upon entering Rapture that you discover the horrific cost of power. The psychotic people of Rapture are horribly deformed \"splicers\" raiding the city for ADAM, the key substance that makes these modifications possible. And they will do anything for ADAM--even kill.  To discover the secrets and tribulations of Rapture, you will have to use weapons and plasmids. The primary weapons are a pistol, shotgun and machine gun. However later in the game you can come across grenade launchers and flamethrowers to aid you in your quest. You will have the opportunity to upgrade your weapons to increase their damage and firing rate. You can also invent new items at U-Invent machines in Rapture where you can make new ammo variations like heat-seeking RPGs. Each weapon offers variation to the way you unleash your payload on the inhabitants.  Bioshock\\'s weapons are fun to use, but it is the plasmids that differentiate BioShock from other FPS. You will collect the electro-bolt plasmid near the start of the game, but as you progress more advanced and more powerful powers will become available. Plasmids also offer a more tactical element to the game as you can use the area around you to your advantage like firing a lightning bolt into water with splicers in it to give them a real shock. The plasmids offer an alternative side to BioShock instead of just running and gunning down enemies which on the whole, makes the game a winner in itself.  To use plasmids to their full effect, you can also obtain gene tonics. These are tonics that will pass over time but can give you a real edge of your enemies. They are split into three categories: physical, engineering and combat. Physical tonics will make you more resistant to damage and become stronger. Engineering tonics improves your machinery skills like hacking safes. Combat tonics can vary from increasing melee damage to making you more prolific with your weapons. But to obtain these tonics and plasmids, you need ADAM.   ADAM can be taken from Little Sisters. Little Sisters used to be ordinary little girls, but experiment have changed their whole way of living. Little Sisters travel through Rapture, extracting ADAM from the various bodies that lie in the city. At first they will seem like easy prey but Little Sisters are protected by a Big Daddy. These monsters, clad in armour-like diving suits, protect Little Sisters with sheer brutality and unmatched aggression.  Big Daddies come in two pain-wielding varieties: a rosie and a bouncer. A rosie carries a mammoth gun whereas a bouncer dishes out pain in close combat with his enormous drill. Defeating a Big Daddy is one of the biggest challenges in the game so you will have to use your weapons and plasmids to great effect. They are quick for such huge and intimidating characters so you will have to move fast and think quick. Creating Armour-piercing bullets is a sure fire way to bring them down along with using your plasmids with the environment around you.  After taking down a Big Daddy, you are rewarded with the presence of an extremely vulnerable Little Sister. Should you harvest all the ADAM from her, or do you rescue her from her genetic sarcophagus but only receive half of the ADAM to use on your modifications. The decision is yours.  Among the chaos of Rapture is a very sophisticated defence system that Rapture\\'s ruler, Andrew Ryan imposed on the city. These defences come in the form of security bots, machine gun turrets and and rocket-propelled grenade launchers which call all be hacked to work in unison with you. To hack these machines, a mini-game must be successfully completed. To complete it you must line up the pipes successfully from start to finish to allow the liquid to pass all the way through. Failing the game will cause the machine to short circuit and damage your health. Vending machines which can provide you with ammo and health packages can also be hacked which in turn can lower the price of the items.   One of the first thing you notice about BioShock when you first play it is how good the game is visually, and how good the audio is. The water effects for the game are simply stunning, from swimming in the ocean at the beginning of the game to walking under water leakages and watching the water pour down the screen. Despite Rapture\\'s sadistic nature, the city still looks beautiful. The buildings are consistent with the 1960\\'s time period, ever little detail counts from the old elevators to the decor furniture of the city. The sheer detail of the characters is astounding, you get detailed view of splicers with their blood ridden clothes and their eerily scary part masks they wear to cover their mutilated faces. You will be hard pressed to find a graphical fault anywhere in the game.  One of the most impressive features of the game is how the atmosphere is portrayed. Playing the game is a thrilling and exciting experience that no other game can offer. The characters in the game are also very intriguing and it is very interesting to see how they develop through the game. Atlas, the man you first meet is a ordinary man with a shocking secret. Andrew Ryan is very complex and neurotic man, which his crazed visions of greatness are a treat to watch. Even the lesser characters have very different qualities to them. You will encounter an insane surgeon who is obsessed with cosmetic perfection with truly terrifying results. Audio dairies are also littered through the city which, if read, offer some interesting insights into what life was and is like in Rapture.  Bioshock has accomplished everything it has set out to do. As a story, you can squeeze about 15 hours out of it including playing it through again and just by exploring the wide open city. However as a FPS, it offers a unique blend of shooting, powers and story-telling that any gamer should not pass up.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Although they haven't been around as long, or received as much press and attention, as Su Doku puzzles, nonograms are still nothing new, and not without a following. The original Picross (short for Picture Crosswords) games were produced by Nintendo for the Game Boy and Super Famicom in the mid-90s, only one of which was released in the United States. However, the puzzles are not unknown to Americans, as they have been published in many puzzle collections, such as Conceptis Tech's website as Fill-A-Pix, and in GAMES Magazine as Paint By Numbers.  The puzzle involves filling certain squares in a blank grid to form a picture - you are to deduce which squares to fill using the series of numbers above and to the left of the grid. Although there are multi-color (harder) puzzles available on the market, this game concerns itself only with single-color puzzles. The grid range in size from the ridiculously easy 5x5 grids to the 25x20 grids which pose a considerable challenge, especially with the limited viewing space of the DS.  The interface is mostly graceful, and for smaller puzzles (5x5 and 10x10) the intended input method - the stylus - is adequate and intuitive. However, when the puzzle requires zooming in to solve, although creative accommodations were made for stylus-users, I found the D-pad and buttons to be the preferred solving method. Also, while the creators could have stuck with black squares in a black-and-white grid, they decided to add some character - one level is themed with fruit and vegetable pictures, they are solved on a grid colored like an apple skin, and selected squares are 'peeled', complete with visual and sound effect. In the same manner, animal-themed puzzles have grids made out of a field of grass. This extra bit of charm is entirely effective, though it can be turned off. The potential for content for this game is vast, and some of it is already realized on the cartridge itself - there are enough puzzles here to keep you satisfied for days. Should you ever run dry, however, you can receive puzzles created by a friend over a wireless link (as well as create your own and send them in the same manner, of course) or download new puzzles over Nintendo Wi-Fi.  Nonograms are a puzzle type that I have always greatly enjoyed, and I was eager to see if this game would be a proper method of experiencing their challenge. I can already see that many a plane ride and waiting room visit will be made considerably more tolerable, thanks to those tiny little squares and numbers.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Ok we all know of or have played Io Interactive’s Hitman series and for the most part found it pretty good for the most part, sticking with a similar Formula Io brings you Kane & Lynch a typical third person shooter that is in its very inhumane world Unique.  First the good points:  Blood and Gore:  Although the core graphics are only acceptable to the Next Gen and especially the PS3’s standards the detail is defiantly shown when you shoot people up close and it splatters everywhere, Whether or not the developers meant to do this I doubt it but it was pulled off pretty well. However, although this part of the game is pretty good to look at, it dips a lot with the frame rate Issues and im sure you all know which console it shows up the most on……. That’s right the PS3 version.  Voice Acting:  For this part of the Game I’d say that around 80% of is it pretty Great especially for the Main Cast of the game, like Kane & Lynch as Kane sounds like how he should ( A Man who hates Lynch and just wants his life to end) and Lynch who also sounds like he should ( A man who thinks he’s all that) but with the good comes the bad and this game follows what a lot of games do and has different AI that look exactly the same (Like the police or for the most part your Henchmen) use the same voice or say the same Line every time you talk to then in game play.   Co-Op:  Ok When I first brought this game I thought there would properly be online co-op as well most next Gen games have however this is not true and according to Wikipedia there is no online Co-Op because of time restrictions and release sates!!!! So yet Another game that was rushed out to meet deadlines, but this isn’t all bad as the off line Co-Op isn’t all that terrible and its pretty much as you’d expect.  Ok Now the BAD:  Online/Multi-player:  I guess this can be classed as partly Co-Op as it mainly requires teamwork and tactical work as the objective is to work as a team to do a list of objectives through certain levels some levels may include bank robbing, Ransom, and killing rich people for money without getting killed. The interesting thing is people can turn on you at any time and kill you for your part of the money so you have to be on your toes at all time. Another thing is when your team does turn on each other and lets say, you get killing you respawn as a police officer to try and take down the ‘’ Fragile Alliance ‘’…. What you just read is how the online is meant to work which would be all ‘’fine and dandy ‘’ (sorry Forest Gump quote XD) if it weren’t the fact that as soon as you log in and start a mission instead of working together to get the money then turn traitor people just shoot you until there one left and then the mission ends I actually did this 5 times and used my watch to time how long the mission lasted and I counted 29 seconds. Make of this online mode as you will.  Graphics:   As I said previously the Graphics are acceptable to next Gen standards so I could tolerate them for the most part except for the frequent choppy frame rate that is seriously bad about 2 hours into the game.  Frequent ‘Fuck’ Reference: I personally think using swearing is a good thing in video games as it makes the game more realistic and more down to earth but in the beginning missions especially I think its used in every FUCKING sentence I mean Fucking hell you’d think these fucking people would just shut the fuck up XD. Basically its over used which makes the game more laughable than anything else.  AI:  Apart from a few times in which the AI is actually good, the AI goes from Stupidly easy in some cases to Stupidly Hard and character models for the AI is also in most cases practically detailed e.g. Police BUT although being detailed its ONLY one character model and you’ll find yourself killing the same Police Officer over and over again.  Overall Apart from an Interesting but Bad online experience Kane & Lynch Dead men doesn’t bring anything new to the Genre and sticks with what it knows which, Believe me Isn’t a lot. The Good: ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Blood and Gore look great ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Good Voice acting.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Not bad Co-Op The Bad: ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Interesting but Seriously bad Online mode ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Graphics don’t show what the PS3 can really do ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Ridiculous use of the F word ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 AI is lacking ',\n",

       "  'description': \"First thing noticeable about Team Fortress 2 is the visual art style. Derivation from 1950's and 60's advertising automatically centers this game around the rare category of quirky and unique themed games this generation. Where squad based realistic shooters dominate the market, TF2 is an oasis in this time of need.  Don't let the name fool you however, the games Fortresses take a backseat to the classes. There's no shortage of abundance as you take control of nine highly unique classes across three categories. The agile double jumping Scout, stereotypical drill sergeant Soldier and enigmatic Pyro compose the offensive classes. One 'Black Scottish Cyclops' Demoman, thick-headed Minigun wielding Heavy and technical genius Engineer takes care of defending your base. The final trio of characters falls under support. The German (and based on timeline, probably Nazi) Medic, the Australian Sniper with disapproving parents and [sadly hard-mode] backstabbing Spy.  As you take control of your class of choice you have a handful of maps and game types both user and developer made to satisfy your play style. These range from your typical 'capture the flag' modes to territory capture and cart pushing stages. There is definitely something to suit everyone’s taste.Valve has put a lot of love into this game. With regular updates and the continual series of 'Meet The...' videos, Team Fortress 2 is kept free from staleness and players never have to feel neglected. Whether you're a First Person Shooter veteran or newcomer to the genre there is really no excuse for passing on this rare gem, especially when bundled with the very reasonably priced Orange Box or standalone purchase on Steam.Five Stars\",\n",

       "  'description': \"When the NFL sold their soul, I mean, exclusivity rights, to EA Sports, what was a competitive genre for games became a struggle to find a niche outside of the NFL (for everyone whose name isn't Madden, that is). Midway found success early on with Blitz: The League, although comparing EA's franchise to B:tL is like comparing apples to steroid-pumping, foul-mouthed oranges with severe anger issues.  It took them a while longer, but 2K Sports and Visual Concepts believe that they have found their niche, by offering Madden-esque gameplay, but instead using names you know from the history of the NFL (unlike Midway's LT and Romo, most of the roster of stars 2K has assembled are widely respectable, OJ Simpson comments aside) since they can't use the names you know from today's game. Also gone are the numerical stats, replaced with gold, silver, and bronze stars, and 'attributes' like Pocket Presence and Brick Wall. This is very effective for the game, since it avoids questions of who is the better quarterback, Dan Marino or John Elway, but details what each quarterback excelled at - Dan's Quick Release and John's Cadence, for example.  The gameplay experience begins by prompting you to create your first team - not only what players you will have in what positions, but your team name, city, stadium, and entire look, which can be incredibly satisfying. Your team's strength is preset - two gold players, three silver, and six bronze. This is a key point to part of the game's real value, which I'll address shortly.  After you create your team, you are automatically dropped into a 'quick match' setup screen, which may prompt you to wonder if you accidentally bypassed the menu screen. No, in fact, there is no menu screen, a menu overlay can be brought up using the right thumbstick. I found this to be a clumsy and unintuitive mechanic, and far inferior to the traditional interface.  So now, you think, it's time to start up the single-player mode. This may or may not be true. If you haven't played 2K5 since... well, 2K5, then you'll need to go through a quick match or two to figure out the game - there are no tutorials on game mechanics. If you are an Xbox 360 Achievement... enthusiast, you'll need to play through the season mode... several times... to get all the achievements available, and for that I pity you. And since it's a pretty fair description of myself, there's some feeling sorry for myself that goes along with it. If neither of these two descriptions fit you, don't bother with the single-player mode. It may as well not exist. There is no incentive, no impetus to progress through the season, no sense of drama or progression other than playing through a string of games. Also, your opponents may have as many as six (SIX!) gold star players, or as few as none. This lends itself to the game feeling horribly unbalanced at times. This mode is not fun, and it seems as if the developers just skimmed over it, as if it wasn't important.  The multiplayer mode... ohhhh, the multiplayer mode. Games can be set up as single games, tournaments, or even entire leagues. You are playing only with other people's created teams - which means two gold stars, three silver, six bronze for EVERYBODY. No one team is really stronger than any other, there is only well-built and less so. Finding games, tournaments, and leagues is easy and intuitive. Clearly, the bulk, if not the entirety, of your experience with this game should be spent online.  As for presentation, the sounds of the game are wonderful, and the majority of player animations are attractive and realistic, although the player models are thin and lanky (typical for 2K football) and voiced not-so-well. The arenas are animated beautifully, and the commentators are colorful, perhaps even too much so, and in the case of reporting injuries, inaccurate.  If you are looking for a single-player football experience, this game is not even to be considered, there's simply not enough value here. However, this is, quite likely, the most detailed, strategic, and faithful online multiplayer football experience that has ever come out for any system. If you enjoy multiplayer football, or never played it but want to give it a shot, this game comes highly recommended. With any luck, All-Pro Football 2K9 will be the total package.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Everyone likes a challenge, everyone likes ninjas and I’d imagine everyone would like scantily clad ladies. So you’d imagine Ninja Gaiden 2 would be a great game because it has all of these in large amounts but with a boring story, cheap bosses and a bad camera Ninja Gaiden 2 is a game that - for full price - can stay in the shadows. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Playing as expert ninja Ryu Hayabusa is a blast at the best of times. The simple joy of fighting multiple evil ninja footmen can’t be ignored especially when you have such a diverse selection of weapons. From swords to scythes all weapons have a unique feel and it won’t be too long before the player will get a feel for a few they like and stick to them. Weapons can also be upgraded to unlock new combos for them. Attacking with these weapons comes in two varieties; quick attack and strong attacks. Mixing these up can create a devastating torrent of pain that’ll turn your enemy from eager foe to bloody stump. In the process of turning them into bloody stumps it’ll be more than likely find that one of their limbs will of been chopped off. It’s at this time Ryu can finish them with a press of the Y button and then the game will take over and the camera will get closer for Ryu to pull a bloody, visceral kill. Each weapon has a few but after a while you’ll notice them recycling again and again which is undoubtedly inevitable but for a game that focus’s so much on the action you’d expect more than you get. These finishers aren’t the only time the game takes control away from the player, by holding down Y Ryu will charge a powerful attack and once it’s powerful enough he’ll unleash it on the enemy killing them, This shows a brutal scene of Ryu ripping apart his enemies. The charging will happen faster when Ryu absorbs orbs (that fly to him) from dead enemies. The idea is you shoot from one enemy to another killing them with ease the only problem is that all your doing is holding Y and choosing a direction to charge in and the game rewards this by giving you more currency.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Ryu has other tricks up his sleeve such as ranged attacks. You start off with only shurikens but that expands to explosive shurikens as well as an underwater gatling gun and a bow however these last two have quite clumsy controls. The gatling gun expects you to continually press fire (why would I need to do this if it’s a gatling gun?) and the bow takes too long to switch from aiming mode to moving mode meaning that enemies may get a hit on you due to the change but neither of these will slow you down a bunch. Ryu also has ninja magic (called Ninpo) which will give him invincibility while he casts it. These are good if you’re surrounded or in another tight spot. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Boss battles can be some of the best or most frustrating moments in Ninja Gaiden. At the best of times you’ll fight a challenging opponent and you’ll feel like a champ for overcoming them. At the worst of times you fight them again and again and again while they grab you and take off a large proportion of you’re life bar with one throw or bash you to high heaven with a bunch of attacks. This is a simple fact of playing Ninja Gaiden and one you’ll have to accept. Still one thing you shouldn’t have to accept is fighting bosses multiple times. While it isn’t quite DMC4 bad it’s still recycled content that I’m sure they could replace with other encounters if they wanted to. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 At this point you may wonder what makes Ryu a ninja instead of just a regular fighter and the answer is wall running of course! Because who wants to spend all their time just fighting demons when there are walls to be ran? Me that’s who! These platforming sections are unnecessary and boring but rarely frustrating. The game also does a good job of teaching you how to do these maneuvers one after another, although they name them in such a way that when you come to a point when you see a scroll on the ground that basically says “Do the Flying bird flip!” You won’t remember what it’s talking about whereas if it called them something simple like wall jump you’d know exactly what it’s talking about. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The story is weak but for an engine to move the demon hunt from  to  it does well. The characters don’t really feel well defined or interesting and are again a vehicle for the game to have a hero and boss battles. The story’s quality is really shown in the poor dialogue and voice acting. However Ninja Gaiden’s sounds effects are great and really draw you into the world. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Ninja Gaiden is a fun game if you can get over the difficulty and really get into the combat. This game isn’t worth full price and I would find it hard to want shell out even half that price if I got the chance although if you’re into action games like DMC you should give this a whirl at some point but for those who aren’t sure about the genre or this game in particular it’s definitely worth at least a rent.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Point and click adventures have had a bit of a downward trend of late, never being able to reach the lofty heights of those classic Lucasarts games, such as Day of the Tentacle and Sam and Max. There is however hope for the genre, and the DS is a perfect place for this small revival. Phoenix Wright is a rookie attorney, having been taken under the wing of Mia Fey, his mentor and all round babe. The mechanics of the game are relatively simple: a murder will be commited and Mia and Phoenix will take the case at the behest of the one accused of said murder, as they say they are innocent. What follows is a hark back to the old point and click days, using the stylus to search crime scenes, ask questions of witnesses and detectives and try and work out what is going on. There are some genuinely shocking twists in the story, and the list of over the top characters grows through out the game. The game really hits its stride, however, when you have collected enough evidence and spoken to enough people to move the action to the courtroom and begin a trial. The trial brings you up against a prosecutor, who's job it is to send the accused to jail or worse, and they do their job with extreme prejudice, often trying to win at all costs and cheating to do it.  The prosecutor will call a witness, who then gives a testimony. It is your job as Phoenix to find the contridictions within the testimony and call them out, which can be done literally. You have the ability to phyisically shout 'OBJECTION' into the DS mic, which then does the same in the game and allows you to present evidence to counter the witness's lies, however this can also be done with careful pushing of the statements the witness comes out with.  The trials can lead to the games best moments, and is most of the twists come out, and because of this they can become tense and heart pounding affairs as you spend your time trying to work out exactly what really happened.  There are four trials in total, with a fith bonus one, which brings about new mechanics that allow you to rotate a 3D piece of evidence around, dust it with fingerprint powder and blow into the mic to reveal the print, as well as other things. Its a shame that these sections are only included in the last case though, as they are a neat addition to the game.  In all Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney is a thought provoking game, in the true spirit of the point and click adventure, and while it obvious japanese origins and anime stylings may put some off, but they are missing out on a highly original and fun game.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Some people cried foul after the Wii launched without a Mario game. However, after the mediocre reception Super Mario Sunshine received, Shigeru Miyamoto and the team at Nintendo promised to reinvigorate the franchise. Luckily, Nintendo has kept its promise and brought a new Mario game that is completely fresh---whether it be control scheme, musical score or artistic design. The game keeps with the traditional Mario game structure while the change of setting allows for an unprecedented imaginative world. While the Wii has preached to the casual gamer, this is one of the first titles that really crosses into both casual and hardcore gaming realms because it includes something that will appreciated by all. Mario games are not known for their story--something still apparent from the moment you begin to play the game. Much like Super Mario 64, Princess Peach calls for Mario to come to her castle because she has a gift to give to him. Upon his approach to the castle, Bowser, Mario's longtime nemesis, attacks the Princess, Mario, and the ever present Toads with Peter Pan-like flying galleons. Before Mario can catch up, Bowser and his minions jet away into space. Mario comes into a contact with a cute star named Luna who then introduces him to the leader of a flying observatory, Rosalina. Mario is filled in on the problems which have plagued the inhabitants of the observatory and is promptly asked to assist in recovering the power stars that power their spacecraft. Bowser has once again stolen the power stars and spread them through a variety of galaxies so as to slow down his pursuers. Mario's principle mission is to recover enough power stars to re-initiate the observatory's power. This task that seems to be daunting even for the famous Italian plumber, and thus Rosalina instructs Luna to assist him during his quest. The collection of power stars is nothing new, and could seem very unexciting to a veteran Mario player. But then again, who plays Mario for the story? It is the brilliant efforts by the team at Nintendo to redesign every world that Mario journeys to that makes the game really special. One hardly has anytime to think about the repetitive nature of the storyline as the player is almost immediately thrown into an amazing galaxy. Every galaxy is made up into several planets, all of which have their own individual parts and none of which you will see repeated. The level design in the game is one of the most, if not the most, impressive ever seen in a video game. Once you think that you have seen it all, Mario will land on a planet where he travels into the inside or travels into more traditional sidescroller with freshening elements like changing gravity pads. These new elements make the gameplay more challenging and thus really make the overall experience that much richer to any Mario veteran. The way Mario travels between the planets is also unique and utilizes the motion sensing technology in the Wii remote. Sometimes planets will be connected by a series of blue stars with which the player can point the cursor at and then pull Mario along. This movement style is also worked into several challenges at the end of the game that prove to be exhilarating. In addition to the blue stars, Mario will often times find one of Luna friends who is desperately hungry and requires star bits to transform into a launch pad to another planet. Star bits are another collectible in the game in addition to the traditional coins. Whereas coins replenish Mario's depleted health, star bits can be used to feed Luna's friends but can also be used to attack enemies. Luna's primary function in the story is to serve as the pointer on the screen with which players can use to pick up star bits and to aim star bit attacks. Of course she is also there to provide the much needed moral guidance and explanation of puzzles. One comes to appreciate the different level design through the exploration of the various galaxies. Whereas in other games, players find that the search for the same item every level can be tedious, in Super Mario Galaxy the design of the planets is so intriguing that players will find that they explore every nook and cranny to discover every hidden area.To create even more diversity within the level design, Mario also is able to don different costumes that will give him different powers. At his repertoire is the ability to change into a bee, springman or a boo, the ability to throw fireballs, and the ability to turn into the ice man who freezes any water that he walks upon. All of the different costumes add even more ways to explore the already impressive worlds. However, some of the costumes evince some of the problems in the game. One such problem is the camera. The player has very limited control of the camera as it is usually fixed through the entirety of the adventure. This proves to be a problem in some of the later stages when precise jumping is necessary, especially when trying to get several challenge stars or when Mario turns into springman. It is noticeable at first when Mario runs on the underside of a planet as the controls quickly switch and make circumnavigating a planet challenging. The camera also makes the bee parts of the game unnecessarily difficult because it is often times hard to judge whether Mario is above or close enough to a honeycomb to land. Luckily this is really the only time the camera becomes a major issue in the gameplay and thus does not really make a large impact on the overall experience. Even if the camera sometimes proves to be difficult, the tight controls based off of the genre defining Mario 64 setup are near perfect. Controlling Mario will be of no real challenge to experienced players but is simple enough for the most casual of gamers to pick up and enjoy. The Wii remote functionality is limited, something that proves to be beneficial. It is used for the aforementioned traveling between planets and picking up star bits, but it is also utilized nicely into the combat. By shaking the Wii remote, the player has the ability to do a spin attack which proves to be essential in several boss battles and causes enemies to drop different items than through the traditional jump-on-the-head method. More importantly, the motion control functionality is used intermittently with various mini games and thus do not become tiresome. When many Wii games go wrong with their inclusion of motion control for every basic action, Super Mario Galaxy gets it right--only using it for certain elements that enhance, not detract, from the gameplay. Combined with the gameplay and tight controls, the audio and graphical presentation really make Super Mario Galaxy stand out from any other game available on the Wii. The game is simply the best looking game from a graphical and an artistic standpoint as all of the worlds are intriguing while made all the more interesting through the vibrant color pallet. Like the graphics, the audio is one of the best found on the platform. The mix of classic and new sounds is a symmetry that is phenomenal. Players will not only hear the classic Mario songs and their remixes, but also hear fully orchestrated tracks that are memorable. Super Mario Galaxy can be summed up by stating that it is a return to form. Not a form in the sense of structure, but rather of feel. While playing this game one will surely notice that it is fun and more importantly, different that everything else. The game includes many of the elements that made previous Mario games so memorable while almost completely reinventing the experience due to the new control scheme and the sensational level design. Nintendo's mascot has never been better, and this adventure is not something anyone can afford to miss. \",\n",

       "  'description': 'If you actually remember 2004’s Final Fantasy’s Online also classed as Final Fantasy 11, you will certainly remember the disappointment when the game hit shelves and you played it for the first time.  Again for Square Enix’s 12 editions to the series, Final Fantasy XII’s disappointment gushes from this game, from the moment you press start to the moment the end credits role. Die Hard Final Fantasy fans will be disappointed to hear that the greatly loved classic battle system of the previous games has been brutally changed with dire effects, as the battle system is now, still turn based to a degree, its much more involving to the fact that it requires more in-depth skill rather than your characters strength… This is mainly due to the fact that an improved gambit system has been added in which allows you to program to a sense your allies to do what ever you tell them.  Another thing that Final Fantasy XII touches on would be its great visuals when it comes to in game play and cut scenes. Although many fans found that Final Fantasy X lacked what really makes a Final Fantasy experience, none of them could fault the amazing visuals as is true with one of its successors, the in game visuals are very good to look at as well as mind blazingly detailed for the most part.  On the down side to these visuals you will easily encounter the Frame rate to be dire at times, which may even lag the game down, as well as its ridicules lengthy loading screens at every corner or doorway.  Linking in with the fame rate and visuals of the game, the layout is something to be desired as Final Fantasy XII also gets rid of the random bouts in which players would be exploring the land and suddenly enter a fight with an unknown monster. Now there is an upside to this as well as a downside. The upside would be it makes exploring more enjoyable and doable as you’re not entering random bouts every few steps as well as you can now see the monsters all over the map so if you choose you can avoid them. The downside to this however is much more brutal to the fact that as you can avoid them and won’t enter random fights, it is now extremely hard to find a monster to fight with as at some parts of this game you wont find any to kill to gain levels. To conclude this review and make the Players even more frustrated would be the loose story line and depth to the characters from the start to the finish, this is shown as soon as game play becomes available due to the fact in some ways its similar to Final Fantasy X’s story line in the way that the main character gets lost and then tries to find a long lost relative while killing or meeting companions on the way. This describes XII’s story line all too well as the main character Vann tries to uncover what really happened to his brother in the war and again on the way meeting these include:  Basch: A banished and disgraced Knight who was blamed for the Kings death and also who has a twin brother Ashe: A forgotten princess who lost her husband in the War and wants to find answers  Balthier: A sky pirate and thieve who is just trying to make his way in the world  Fran: Balthier’s partner in crime who also possesses a lot of Knowledge about magic.  This game has very few or none at all good points that Casual gamers will want to try out. However if you are one of many Die hard Final Fantasy fans then you will get a few kicks out of this but not many and this game is certainly forgettable.',\n",

In much the same way, Elite Beat Agents will have you tapping, dragging, and spinning surrounded by a manic flair all its own, all wrapped up in a funny and pleasing package.  The mechanics really couldn\\'t be simpler. The game only asks you to do three things - tap an indicated area of the screen on an indicated beat of a song, drag the stylus from one indicated area to another in an indicated rhythm, or draw circles on the screen as fast as you can. That said, you will be asked to do these things quickly and precisely, so levels can very anywhere between incredibly hard and frustratingly difficult, most often falling in the area of \"OK, I\\'ll really get it this time...\"  The style is a bit bizarre, but always entertaining and fast-paced, which suits the substance of the game perfectly.

The game also will not have the lasting appeal of an RPG or strategy game it will take forever to complete - the songs are limited, and once you have them down, there\\'s little replay value.

       "  'description': 'Despite the title of Metal Gear Solid, Snake Eater is a very different game than previous installments in the series. After Metal Gear Solid 2 received criticism for its complex story, Kojima Productions created a narrative that was more fluid, yet includes the great plot twists that we have come to expect from the series. While the player does not control the namesake character of the series, Solid Snake, we are put in control of an close-to-complete carbon copy. It will be easy for those who have not followed the story arc to not understand that they are not controlling Solid Snake but are actually controlling Naked Snake, the man who becomes Big Boss.The mission takes place during the tumultuous 1960s during the peak of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States and the possible nuclear holocaust that could occur with any confrontation. The delicate balance of peace between the Soviet Union and the United States is threatened by the rogue Colonel Volgin who feels betrayed by what he perceives as the weakness of the Soviet leaders during times of stress. Volgin plans to take over the USSR after promoting a conflict between the two powers by capturing key scientists and creating a nuclear weapons delivery system. One of these scientists, Sokolov, defected to the United States but is recaptured by Volgin and is forced to create Shagohold, the mobile nuclear tank that threatens the United States from any position in the world.The CIA drops Naked Snake into the thick Soviet jungle so as to rescue Sokolov and therefore disrupt Colonel Volgin\\'s plans. The game creates a sense of survival through the implementation of the stamina bar and the injury treatment system, as Naked Snake is all by himself with no hope of rescue if something wrong occurs.Keeping with the 1960s time period, Naked Snake is also unable to employ the same high tech gadgetry that is used in previous installments of the series rather he must utilize weapons and gadgets which would be high tech at the time. Even though the aforementioned gadgets can be used, Snake must use the jungle environment to his advantage. He must capture local fauna and flora to eat in order to keep his stamina up and will also need to adjust his stealth strategy due to the large number of environment variations. In order to not alert enemy soldiers, players will need to adjust Snake\\'s appearances, whether it be different camo patters and face paints or donning a complete disguise.As there is no hope of evacuation when Snake gets injured, he must perform surgery on himself when he gets injured and administer medication if he gets sick. This new element to the gameplay adds tremendously to the idea that Snake is all alone in the jungle and provides for a small mini-game. However, it is important to note that the injury treatment system does get tedious towards the end of the game, especially when many injuries occur during boss battles.Unless you are a very skilled Metal Gear Solid player, Snake will be detected and will have to either hide or fight his way out of the situation. The good news is that the implementation of a free moving camera now allows players to scan for enemies in the vicinity more easily which will allow for less unwanted encounters with the enemy. During sections of the game where fighting is necessary, Snake now has a more balancing fighting repertoire due to the inclusion of the \"close-quarter-combat\" system. Players now have the ability to neutralize their foes when they get too close while not alerting other enemies.One of the staples of the gameplay in the Metal Gear Solid series are the boss battles. Snake Eater includes some of the most diverse and satisfying boss encounters that one will come across in video games. Not only are boss\\' appearances and personalities different, but they also have different fighting techniques which are used to take advantage of the wide range of locations in which the battles take place. One particularly memorable fight is the sniper battle between Naked Snake and The End, which proves to be one of the hardest and longest boss battles you will ever participate in, but more importantly, one of the most satisfying.The great combat and stealth sections really highlight the overall presentation of the game. When moving around the world, the attention to detail really comes into the forefront of your mind. The complexity and detailed world called for the creation of a new game engine and pushes the Playstation 2 to its technical limits. The amount of creatures and enemies in a world that includes cycling weather patterns and diverse areas of the jungle create one of the most realistic environments seen on this generation. More importantly, the game\\'s frame rate holds up nicely while their are no noticeable technical glitches--quite an achievement due to the ambitious presentation.In addition to the graphical presentation, the voice work and musical score are very memorable. David Hayter, the voice of Solid Snake, performs the voice of Naked Snake and proves why he is one of the best voice actors in the industry. However, the one bad element of the voice acting seems to be that of Ocelot\\'s character. The actor seemed to put stress on the wrong words while delivering lines that really detract from the cinematic experience that is seemingly perfected by Hayter\\'s voice work and Kojima\\'s cut scene direction. The musical score, on the other hand, is flawless and thus very memorable, especially the title song \"Snake Eater\". Performed in a very James Bond-like manner, the lyrics were written by Hideo Kojima and capture the themes and ideas behind the game, while the actual singer gives a powerful performance that add to the emotion of Naked Snake\\'s odyssey .All of these elements combined together creates one of the most ambitious Playstation 2 titles, but more importantly, one of the best. The criticisms of the complex story in MGS2 are eradicated in Snake Eater, but nonetheless include plot twists that one has come to expect in the series. Frustrating camera and close combat control are eradicated and thus no longer detract from the overall experience, while the presentation causes player to really admire the environment that was created. Some of the final missions in the game seem to drag on too long, but one\\'s enthusiasm and enjoyment is never belittled due to the unsurpassed voice work and cut scene direction. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is simply unforgettable.',\n",

       "  'description': \"No game since the original Call of Duty has been able to capture the essence of the genre quite like it. The second game in the series, and Call of Duty's debut on consoles, follows in the footsteps of its predecessor by providing a campaign brimming with intense gun combat and a fully featured fast-paced online multi-player mode. Although Call of Duty 2 may not have much of a narrative, its exciting action and addictive multi-player will keep you interested one way or the other.You'll start the campaign as a Russian soldier, but later you'll fight as both a Briton and an American. Besides having weapons distinct to each faction like the American's Thompson sub-machine gun and the Russian's Mosin Nagant, each faction has distinct battles. For example, as a Russian you'll defend Stalingrad and as an American you’ll take part in a D-Day landing on Point du Hoc. Although each faction has subtle differences, you’re still killing Nazi’s when it comes down to it.Each mission begins with a vignette, which includes authentic war footage, but unless you're already interested in World War II history, these intros are pretty dry. Also, Call of Duty 2 has no characters or narrative to follow. The story is almost non-existent, but the game makes up for it with a genuine feeling of camaraderie between you and your fellow soldiers.As a member of your squad you fight for your life just like everyone else. Nazis constantly fire from all sides so you’ll need to use cover and have a steady shot in order to be successful. But you’re not alone. Your squad mates are adept and they’ll often help YOU just as much as you help them. Bits of their dialog like “Cover me, I’m reloading!” also help establish the bond between you and your fellow soldiers.If there's one aspect of World War II that Call of Duty 2 conveys best, it's the frenetic action of warfare. There’s never a dull moment, whether you’re kneeling behind sandbags picking off Nazis one by one, sniping enemies from afar, or commandeering tanks in the North African desert. Most objectives are simple: make it to the spot on your compass-map while killing every Nazi on your path. And thankfully the shooting is lots of fun, because you’ll be doing a lot of it. Each gun has a growl that sounds genuine and feels powerful, and the aiming reticule is subtle to keep you immersed in the action.Although the multi-player isn’t a cinematic experience, it’s fully featured with several maps and game types. It’s easy to get right into the action with a “Quick Match,” and a whole lot of fun to pick your favorite faction and weapon to hone your skills with. The maps are varied, giving you a variety of options and overall the game has a top-notch online experience.Call of Duty 2’s thrilling campaign and competitive multiplayer make it one of the best first-person choices on the Xbox 360.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Gamers familiar with Konami\\'s Bemani series of games knows that there\\'s so much more beyond Dance Dance Revolution. The company has produced a number of addictive rhythm games, some having players dancing to a manic beat, others by having them hammer on plastic instruments. The most popular of the latter variety is Guitar Freaks, which has a player wear a guitar strapped to his or her torso, pressing three buttons on the neck one hand while hammering on a paddle where the other hand would be wailing on the strings of a real guitar. Sadly, with the success that Dance Dance Revolution has seen on consoles in North America, none of the other Bemani games, Guitar Freaks most bemoanedly so, have made the trans-Pacific journey.  Guitar Freaks freaks, sate your hunger.  Enter Guitar Hero, the next in a line of rhythm games from developer Harmonix Music - the company that brought you Frequency and Amplitude - and publisher RedOctane, who stepped into the rhythm-stepping genre with In The Groove earlier this year. The basic game mechanics are the same - press fret buttons on the neck of the \\'guitar\\' and strum a paddle on the body to correspond with visual cues on the screen. Use the whammy bar to modulate long notes, and tilt the guitar upright for a bonus effect. OK, nothing new here.  Except that little things mean a lot. First of all, the game ramps up both the difficulty and the authenticity of the guitar-playing mechanic by having five buttons on the neck instead of three. With three buttons, playing Guitar Freaks felt as much like playing a real guitar as... well, as playing Dance Dance Revolution feels like real dancing (go to your local nightclub, head out to the dance floor, and do the steps for Butterfly - see how long it takes you to get thrown out). By adding the fourth and fifth buttons, making players move their hands and use their pinkies (at higher difficulty levels) to play all the notes, Guitar Hero takes a step away from \\'playing a rhythm game\\' and towards \\'playing a musical instrument\\'.  Secondly, the presentation of Guitar Freaks is exactly like that of Dance Dance Revolution - you pick a song from a long list of songs, and go to town. In Guitar Hero, though, you\\'re given a way to measure your progress - you name your band, choose your axe-wielding avatar, and start playing in someone\\'s basement. Further success leads to a nightclub, a tour, and ultimately... \"The Garden\". On your way, you\\'ll be given a select list of songs to play... in the basement, you\\'ll only have access to a short repertoire of the easiest songs in the game (thankfully, \"Smoke On The Water\" is on that list... you\\'ll want to scratch that itch right away). As you progress, you\\'ll be given harder and more complex riffs to play. In this way, the game eases you through its learning curve - you\\'ll be surprised how quick you become confident with that pinky.  Thirdly, Guitar Hero\\'s atmosphere just speaks to rockers. From the antics on stage (playing the guitar behind the head, setting fire to the guitar at the end of a set) to the secondary parts of the game (guitarist advice during the loading screens, amps that go to 11, high-score lists on bathroom walls), everything about the feel of this game fits perfectly. If the developers of this game don\\'t just love hard rock, they fake it very well, and talked to a lot of people who do.  It stands to mention that the main list of 30 tracks the game advertises are covers, but extraordinarily well done ones. With a few exceptions (go ahead, just try to sing like Freddy Mercury... convincingly), all of the primary songs are played and sung nearly identically to how they were made famous. In addition, the game also includes 18 unlockable songs by lesser-known artists, as well as a host of other unlockables, like a number of Gibson guitars, skins, and playable characters, including \"Grim Ripper\". Yeah. That\\'s right. Nothing beats playing \"Symphony of Destruction\" as Death himself, thrashing on his scythe-guitar.  All of this material will be highly appreciated by true fans of hard rock music, if not by others. If none of the above sounds appealing to you, then this game just isn\\'t for you. Sure, the idea of a guitar-based rhythm game might be fun, but a $70 price point should quell any thoughts of it being a worthwhile buy. But if you know that you should never give a drummer a microphone, if you know why you should never eat anything thrown onstage, if you know a crowd is just heckling you if they\\'re yelling for you to play \"Freebird\", and, especially, if you know that 11 IS louder than 10... this game is priceless.',\n",

       " {'deck': 'Mass Effect',\n",
       "  'description': 'Mass EffectCombat:\\xa0Since this an action rpg, combat stands out as the most important part. It\\'s third person real time with a pausing mechanism where you can choose which of your abilities to use and switch your guns out. You have yourself and two companions out of a total of six on the battlefield. You fully control yourself and may take cover, lean out and shoot, or be a total dumbass and run right in front of the enemy shooting. You also do a melee attack with your gun if you are close enough to the enemy which does a bunch of damage(there is a talent you can raise to do more). There is four different gun types, three combat abilities, four tech abilities, and six biotic(force) abilities. Everything is useful enough, some things better then others. This is balanced out with the recharge time on the abilities, the less useful ones return in a few seconds and the most useful ones taking about a minute to return. \\xa0Back to your party members, you do not have direct control of them. You can send them to certain locations or call them back with the D-pad but I found that they were usually smart enough that I didn\\'t have to tell them what to do. When you are in the puase menus(called up with the RB and the LB) you can tell them which power of there\\'s to use. You also have full control of there equipment. On the equipment screen, you can quickly change out upgrades on your weapons and armor that give bonuses to accuracy, damage, damage against organics and a bunch of fun stuff like that. The only complaint I have about this is that you don\\'t see any of the numbers change on the weapons and I often forgot what upgrade I had on my four weapons, grenade launcher, and armor. If they just placed a second number next to the first, that would make this alot more fun.\\xa0\\xa0Overall, combat is probably the most fun I had with this game. It\\'s better then most action rpg\\'s, and definitely the best bioware has ever done.\\xa0Choices+Consequence=Mass Effect?:\\xa0Choices a plenty in this game, it\\'s just missing the other part of the equation, consequences. The only thing these choices ever reward is paragon(light) or renegade(Dark) points depending on how you handled it. But even that doesn\\'t effect much, except something at the end of the game. There is alot of big choices along the road of the main quest that gives you the illusion that you are changing something, at least for the ending. For example, and this is a spoiler, you get a choice of whether to kill or not to kill this bug like race called the rachni. You have the final queen Rachni alive in a tank, and you can either open it or send the poison in. The Rachni caused a bunch of trouble in the universe before, but this rachni says that is all over. It was set up as a very important choice, but nothing. Nada. It\\'s not brought up again. The have it set up so perfectly, so my hope is that it does matter in ME2 but I somehow doubt judging this game.\\xa0The sidequests are very interesting in this respect: You have two speech talents, Charm and intimidate, that will change the conclusion of each sidequest if you have enough points spent in them. It usually leads to less combat but sometimes you learn something interesting you wouldn\\'t have otherwise. It\\'s very fun, and probably the second best part of Mass Effect.Character Development:\\xa0At the beginning of the game you have a choice between six classes that gives you eight of the 24(I think) talents. Three pure classes(combat, tech, biotics) and three mixes. Each class has it\\'s own talent tied to the class(Soldier has the \"Soldier\" talent). They also have the two speech talents and get Spectre Training once you become a spectre. You get three, two, or one talent points each level up and each talent goes up 12 levels. Each level might give you a special ability or unlock a locked talent for your class or just improve the talent. It\\'s overall a simple system, but a pretty interesting one as well. It allows some variety within the classes, and everytime you level up you have a big choice of whether you should raise your combat talents or your speech talents. I haven\\'t found a weak talent, so it seems well balanced as well.Setting and story:\\xa0Your regular sci-fi setting. There is about ten different races, and they all have there quirks and interests. They are still a little bit pidgeoned holed and humans still seem to have the most well difined personalities and variety in quirks and interests. For example, you don\\'t ever meet a skinny Krogan or a Krogan that doesn\\'t like the feel of combat, for example. It\\'s fine, but not great. The story suffers from bioware revealing too much before it came out. I knew pretty much everything up until the final mission, just from the info bioware released before release. It\\'s pretty good, and their is no stupid twist thrown in, I just hope they don\\'t reveal so much of the story for ME2. I would have liked it alot more if they didn\\'t. Final:\\xa0If you are in the mood for an action rpg and have an Xbox 360, go ahead and buy it. It\\'s probably the best game out for the 360 right now and probably for awhile. If you are looking for an amazing rpg that will blow your mind, then lower your expectations. It\\'s not amazing, but it\\'s OK. And that\\'s ok...',\n",

Controls. The controls are very good. They are your basic third person shooter controls. R2 and L2 to shoot. Analogs to walk and aim. And the face buttons to run, jump and perform actions such as entering cars. The controls are basic but easy to use. Graphics next and they are brilliant. Characters and explosions look great. The town of liberty city looks amazing. The town looks simply amazing at night time. You could just fly around checking out the sights. The sound are excellent. From the sound of guns to cars to people in the streets talking to each other. The sounds are great. You know you are in trouble when you hear the whirle of a rocket launcher coming towards you. Also characters sound great. Usually a European accent would annoy me but not Niko's. The game also has a great soundtrack. Lazlo is back again and with he brings more comedy. Also famous artists such as Kayne west, stevie nicks and Ne-yo can be heard on the in car radio. You will run into many characters in GTA IV from small time crooks to mafia dons. Each one of them is very convincing. There are alot of hard choices you will have to make in the game such as who to kill, should you spare them and money or revenge. I have many times felt bad about killing citizens in the game because the people seem so real. Liberty city is the most real city you will ever experience in a game. People walking down the streets will stop and talk to each other. Cops will arrest people other than you. And there are plenty of buildings for you to enter. Police helicopters will fly around the city looking for trouble. The people in the city will respond to things such as the weather, explosions or police sirens. Their are hundreds of conversation to be heard by people on the streets of liberty city. I have never heard the same one twice. You will not find a game with a more realistic setting. The multiplayer side of the game is amazing. Games online are just crazy. You will see the most crazy things happening there. Like are car flying up a ramp and hitting a helicopter into a building to a helicopter chopping of the the back of another helicopter. Seriously I have been in a four way helicopter match over the airport. There are also many ways to customise the match you are in from turning of the cops to allowing only rocket launchers to be used. There are many modes such as race, deathmatch and cops vs robbers. Or you can just play free mode and do whatever you want. The online mode is enough fun to buy the game for alone. GTA IV is a game that everyone should play at least once in there lives. This game is very important to me. It is the best game I have ever played.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots is a stealth action game, just like its predecessors. Also much like its predecessors, it contains many, many lengthy cut scenes. About half of this roughly 15 to 20-hour game will be spent watching, not playing. Even for series veterans, this is a surprisingly large amount. However, MGS 4 is improved from its forebears in a number of important ways.The first major improvement to the series' blueprint is in the controls and gameplay mechanics. In previous games, aiming and firing a weapon in first person was a hassle that required you to press several buttons, and you couldn't move while aiming. In MGS 4, pressing down on the left shoulder button will enter aiming mode, at which point the camera will switch to an over the shoulder perspective, much like in Resident Evil 4 or Gears of War, making shooting a much easier task. You can even go into first-person view and play the game like an FPS game, if you want. Some controls are still a bit fiddly, most notably the CQC (grab) moves, but these are advanced moves you don't ever really strictly need to progress. Combined with the plethora of guns in the game, it seems that Hideo Kojima really wanted players to just blow off some steam and forego the usual stealth shenanigans from time to time. In fact, the game will straight up demand that of you every now and then, but more on that later.When you're not engaged in a firefight, you'll most likely be sneaking around. This area of the game has also been made a lot more playable. Snake is equipped with a high-tech suit, called Octocamo, that adapts to whatever surface you're on, much like a chameleon. This means that you can hide effectively almost anywhere without having to go into the menu and switching camouflage like you would in MGS 3. In one cut scene, Snake is lying prone in a forest area with Octocamo on, and I didn't actually spot him until he moved.Speaking of cut scenes, well, I hope you like them long! MGS 4 is touted as the final game in Solid Snake's saga, and as such, it has a lot of loose ends to tie up. To its credit, it does so. Without spoiling anything, I can say that finality is a big theme in this game. The cut scenes themselves look incredibly impressive. The characters' faces and body language make you forget you're watching digital actors and not real people. Relationships between characters from almost every Metal Gear game are fleshed out and developed, and Kojima's writing ability has definitely developed in this area. Where it hasn't developed so much is in the exposition. The game is divided up into acts, and every act starts with a very lengthy briefing scene to bring you up to speed on the plot, which by now is so complex that Konami has released a wikipedia-like Metal Gear Solid database on the Playstation Store. The game will throw lots of jargon and acronyms your way and it expects you to know what most of them mean. Make no mistake, this game is made purely for fans of the series. If names like Big Boss and Solid Snake sound silly to you and you don't know what a Metal Gear is, turn away, this game is not for you. That's not to say you won't enjoy the gameplay, but the story's emotional impact is totally reliant on your knowledge of who these characters are.Emotional impact. This is a term you might not hear associated with video games very often, but as a longtime follower of the series, there is no way certain parts of the game won't at the very least make you teary-eyed. All the elaborate conspiracy-theory plot happenings wouldn't matter one bit of you didn't care for these characters, and that's where this game shines. The relationship between Snake and Meryl in particular is expertly handled and shows how much Kojima's storytelling has improved. By bringing back a huge cast of characters from every game in the series, Kojima has given this game an epic feel. The chain reaction that started the events in the game started years and years before Snake was even born, and to see it all come together is truly remarkable. Sure, some twists might be far-fetched. Sure, the exposition is long-winded and dry. But as a fan, you won't care. You won't care because you get to see what happens to all these characters, and it's satisfying in a way that few video games are.It's not just the story that is satisfying. As previously stated, the game is divided up into Acts, every act contains an action-filled set piece. You are tasked with taking on an entire unit of elite troops in an abandoned multi-story building together with a familiar character and her squad, you get to ride several vehicles as the gunner, and you even get to control... well, that would be spoiling, but suffice it to say this is what fans have wanted to do since Metal Gear Solid 1. Every time you think the game has outdone itself and it cannot get any more exciting, it ups the ante once more.Metal Gear Solid 4 improves on its predecessors in almost every way and provides an extremely satisfying story for any fan of the series. Newcomers will probably scratch their heads and wonder what all the fuss is about, but to review this game for these people would be silly. This game is 100% fan service, and with that in mind, I cannot score this game any less than Perfect.\",\n",

For example, a person playing the game as a true spy will now have a\\xa0much easier time silently taking out enemies, thanks to the fully 3D camera and new CQC moves, while someone who just wants to run-and-gun their way through the game will be able to, due to the completely overhauled and improved shooting mechanics. Lastly, there is the brand new weapon shop, where Snake can purchase guns and even upgrade them. This feature delivers a much needed boost to the flow of the gameplay, and allows for even more freedom. Overall, the gameplay has seen a huge improvement, especially when compared with previous metal gear games.While the gameplay is greatly improved, its typically not the reason why people play metal gear. Instead, they play it for the story first, and gameplay second. \\xa0Simply said, the story easily meets and exceeds all expectations, and fans will not be disappointed by the conclusion MGS4 offers. Most importantly, the story actually makes sense of all the crazy concepts introduced in the other games (mainly MGS2). Newbies be warned, however, as this game requires knowledge of all previous metal gears games.

Well, we had these things called forums, and these websites called fan sites.

And as my browser loaded on my 56k dial-up modem, a screenshot slowly started to download, second by second - eventually an image of a Pinky Demon and a Zombie appeared on my screen. And so began a 4 year long addiction and obsession with following any piece of news, media and content for Doom 3 that I could get my hands on. Finally, 2004 came along, and I waited in line. Once I had the game in my hand I raced home and popped it in my computer. I turned off the lights and turned up the 5.1 Dolby Digital. Shock set in as I gazed my sites upon one of the most visually stunning games of that time. The ambiance created by the dynamic lighting was amazing. But even more so, the sounds in game of monsters would not settle well with me. This game was one of a kind for scare factor, but there were a few problems....Review:Doom 3 is a game that set out to accomplish the goals which the developers set forth to do. They aimed at creating a visually stunning game that would scare your pants off like you\\'d never experienced before in a video game. Unfortunatly, at the same time Doom 3 was set to launch, a rival company released their top selling action adventure game: Half-Life 2. With this came a lot of comparisons from the gaming community - fanboys were no exception. Doom 3 was blasted for having simple AI - lack luster level design, and a plastic feeling to everything. Oh yes, let\\'s not forget the seperate flashlight/pistol combination. But in all honesty, the game may have been lacking in some areas, but you need to understand that the game is built on a simple idea: Arcade. id Software knew that this game wasn\\'t going to mimick Halo, and they never set out to do this in the first place. Everyone knew that Doom 3 wasn\\'t the same game as Half-Life 2. The story starts out on a military facility based on Mars called UAC. You play a Marine who is brought in to do some routine duties, when suddenly out of no where, a portal to hell is opened and everyone on the base is turned into monsters. Throughout the game you find small PDA\\'s which leave clues and video messages to help guide you throughout your mission. You are given a vast arsenol of weapons, including a: Pistol, chainsaw, shotgun, and a soul cube.There are a few issues with the gameplay, such as the simple AI, and lack of outdoor levels. But this review is written years after the game was created, and I understand the limits that they had on the engine. In conclusion - this is a really fun and scary game to play on the PC. If you have a standard gaming PC in todays market, you will be able to play this game beautifully. Don\\'t cheat yourself, buy this game. It\\'s in the discount rack at your local Gamestop. ',\n",

       "  'description': \"Cheesey\\xa0title I know, but I speak the truth my friends for Battlefield: Bad Company is an action packed standout in a genre packed to the rafters with average titles. Offering a seriously fun Single Player Campaign and solid traditional Battlefield Multiplayer it's hard to find a good reason why this game shouldn't be in your gaming collection.Firstly, lets go back in time a little. To 2006 to be precise, when DICE released Battlefield: Modern Combat. Their first real attempt at cracking the First Person Shooter console market, though the game failed for the most part it did offer us a glimpse of what Bad Company would be like. For Bad Company shares a number of characteristics with its older console brother. Thankfully, Unlike Modern Combat you can stand to play Bad Company for more then a weekend and is actually a very good game. DICE are renowned for their Battlefield series, with two of the most famous being Battlefield: 1942 and Battlefield 2, with many calling the latter one of the greatest Multiplayer games ever made. Yet despite all their knowledge and dominance within the PC Market, they had yet to make a truly impressive FPS for consoles, so after the disapointment of Modern Combat. DICE felt they needed to prove themeselves, so released Battlefield: Bad Company.Battlefield: Bad Company offers a number of unique features to both the whole Battlefield series and FPS as a genre. From the first true, story driven Single Player Campaign to the often stunning destructable environments. But does it all work well together. The quick answer is yes, for the most part. BC does have its problems but is clearly aimed at the console audience and for that it does the job well enough. For the first time in a Battlefield game, BC features a story driven Single Player campaign. You play as Private\\xa0Preston Marlowe.\\xa0a new member of 222nd Army Battalion, also known as Bad Company because of\\xa0all sorts of troubled, confussed or reckless soldiers who instead of being placed in Jail, are placed in this Battalion by the US Army.\\xa0 In all respects they are the cannon fodder of the American forces. One of the great things on offer here is the story, though it can kind of feel a little three kings. It does a great job of offering a\\xa0different perspective on the whole war thing done endlessly in so many games out there. Instead of a story based around you doing your job for the US Forces and being a good 'sir yes sir' type soldier you are out there in the middle of a sensitive war situation fighting for yourself. Fighting for beauitul gold to be precise and we all love gold don't we. So leads on a fantastic story, which features three of your fellow troubled and reckless soliders in Private Terrance Sweatwater (a soldier who hates fighting), Private George Gordan Haggard Jr ''Haggard'' (who loves seeing things blow up) and Sergeant Retford who actually voluntered for the place just so he could get his fishing trip a little early and is in truth the only real leader the squad as. All three are a delight to be around throughout the single player campaign and there is some fantasically written humour throughout. Another character worthy of great mention is the President of Serdaristan, Zavomir Serdar who is hillarious at times. The SIngle Player Campaign takes you on a fantastic adventure and though its not the longest Single Player game out there, you will still feel you got your moneys worth and is worthy of mulitple playthrough. The SIngle Player is also a nice introduction to many of the key learning points of the Multiplayer Experience. You'll drive numourous vehicles, fly and blow a lot of stuff up. Controls are solid, if sometimes clumsy. This is one aspect of BC that is very much like its older brother Modern Combat, as the controls can sometimes feel slow in the middle of a heavy gunfight and aiming can be dodgy from time to time. But Vehicle controls all work well, with great mention of the Helicopter controls which have been simplefied from the PC Version to handle much better with a control pad.\\xa0 I have to admit that BC doesn't make the greatest first impression, if you experienced the demo of BC which was released a few weeks before\\xa0the release of the actual game\\xa0\\xa0you'll know what I'm talking about. The first level isn't great, both graphically and its general feel. But it gets better and better as the story continues and the games engine truly shines in the middle eastern levels and maps are surprisingly large and great to play around. This is a game that lets you take on the action the way you want to, be it crashing through a fortress gate in a gunpacked buggie or in a heavy gunfight. The games A.I does a solid job, and will kill the enemy from time to time though it clearly expects you to do most of the work. Your three team mates never die of course, and infact if you eventually lose health or don't get time to use the magical health injection which puts your health back to 100 you'll of course die. But thankfully it'll place you back at the nearest checkpoint and let you fight on. You'll probably die quite a few times, especially at certain points where you seem to be the centre of attention and endless gunfire comes your way. But of course, you couldn't have a Battlefield game without having any multiplayer and thankfully those who love the battlefield experience will be\\xa0pleased. Multiplayer features only one mode at the moment, that being Gold Rush but due to huge demand DICE have confirmed that the famous Conquest mode will return as DLC in a couple of Months. I have to admit I'm not a huge fan of Gold Rush, its fun for the most part but no Conquest. It feels a little limited on what amazing things can happen as your often stuck defending or attacking the same spots, if you have experience Battlefield 2 you know what great amazing moments I speak of. Though I know friends who have\\xa0enjoyed the mode a great deal but\\xa0it didn't do it for me. So thank the lord that conquest is returning in the coming months. Also in great traditional Battlefield style you can unlock all sorts of weapons for your use in battle and all have a great sense of power to them. Speaking of guns, did I mention that Bad Company as some of the best sound effects and music in any game? well it does and its an absolute blast to listen to in surround sound. Gunfire as a real kick to it and theres some real nice explosive sounds throughout the game, it helps that despite a little bit of a iffy start to the single player levels the game looks great and shines on a large HDTV. Theres a few questionable textures on some of the larger levels but they are forgiven for the\\xa0space on offer to mess around and blow up, the developers stated that 90% of the environment was destructable and I have to agree. Though we are not talking total destruction like Mercenaries where you could flatten a whole city here, most things still\\xa0blow up with great sound and impact. Can't get into a building? then blow up the wall and make your way through. There are times where it can feel a little weird, for instance on occasion while driving\\xa0the tank I got stuck on a little wodden stump and couldn't drive off, yet I was able to knock down many trees and other objects, it can be a little hit and miss. But it works and the game is deserving of its destructable nametag. So fans of the Battlefield series will get an enjoyable Multiplayer experience out of BC, even if its a little off compared to Battlefield 2 or even Modern Combat which did feature a version of conquest. But the single player is rich enough still to worthy a purchase for those that might not be to keen on the multiplayer mode.OVERALLDICE have finally cracked the console Market with Bad Company, though its no Call of Duty 4 its not far off which is great praise for the game. It offers enough that is unique to worthy its purchase and despite mulitplayer being a little hit and miss depending on your mode tastes it still offers a fantastically funny, action packed story driven Single Player Campaign that'll bring a smile to any gamers face.

If you have never played a Zelda game this one would be a good place to start because it can be accessed readily and it is the best game in the series (Arguably). Another trait that really pops out at you is the level design. Every Temple has a puzzle that you need to figure out and at the end of a Temple you fight a Boss. Bosses are the more challenging foes in this game but they are beatable. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time also features an array of weapons that stretch from Sword to Magical Arrows! There are too many words to express about this game but I will simply put it like this, if you haven't played this game then you haven't lived life yet. \",\n",

       "  'description': \"Intelligent Systems Fire Emblem series has been around for nearly two decades dating all the way back to Famicom. Unfortunately it took 13 years before the series finally made its way to western markets. Over the several years it has been here, Fire Emblem has already gathered quite a large fan base, and now with the tenth installment (fourth in North America and Europe), can Intelligent keep the quality next to its predecessors or their other classics including Super Metroid?  Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn is a direct sequel to GameCube's Path of Radiance. While recommended, it's not necessary to have experience with it or any other Fire Emblem. Throughout the game, you will be often reminded what has happened in the past. Three years have passed since Path of Radiance's story ended with Daein loosing Mad King's War against Crimea. Now Begnion troops occupy Daein and try to maintain peace with an iron fist. You follow the story of Dawn Brigade, a group of Daein rebels fighting against the oppression. After that you quickly jump to Crimea to hastily see what's going on there, and then join the laguz fighting against the empire of Begnion. In each part you control a different group of characters, most seen in Path of Radiance - as a matter of fact all characters from the previous game make a comeback here, including a few dead ones. First the story feels very shallow and generic and regrettably it takes twenty hours before it finally starts to develop and twist. Of course you'll have to make it that far first.  If you've played Path of Radiance, the carbon copy gameplay won't have any surprises. Long-time fans may find it a good thing but for me the game feels out of place. What's the point of making a Wii game if you won't take advantage of the one strong point? You can use GameCube controller, CIassic or Wiimote sideways to play the game. In combat the system works well, but a click-and-drag system with the Wiimote pointer could have done wonders in the menus and point and click in battles should even be more fun. In the current state, it can sometimes take way too long to do the basic maintenance after every battle. Talking about menus, you may encounter strange stuttering in the inventory and shop screens once your team has grown larger and Wii's DVD drive does the best it can trying to keep up with the massive amount of items.  There are two human races in Fire Emblem, beorc and laguz. Beorc are the ordinary humans with warrior, mage, thief and archer cIasses. Laguz also known as the beast people don't wear armor, use weapons or cast spells, but rather shapeshift into animals. Unfortunately they can't stay in animal form forever and are completely useless in human form. Beorc have stronger nations and unsurprisingly find themselves superior to laguz bringing up the game ethics and philosophies. Laguz are divided to hawk, raven, dragon, wolf, tiger, heron (sort of angel) and cat tribes. Every cIass and tribe has their weaknesses and strong points and you'll have to keep a close look at the rock-paper-scissors system. Lance wins sword, sword wins axe and axe wins lance. The same method continues with magic as fire is superior to wind, wind to thunder and thunder to fire. That alone is enough for a newcomer to learn, but it's not all. Every turn you'll also have to think about terrain advantages, mounted and flying units, bows and counter-attacks. Fight against your weakness and you'll find yourself dead in no time. Even on the easiest difficulty, you can find yourself reloading after mistakes to keep characters alive as if someone dies, he is gone forever. Thankfully, an option to save in middle of battle has been added making the experience a lot more enjoyable.  Except for choosing the equipment and few special skills there isn't much character customization going on. Though you can rarely get the gears you want because except for gaining money at predetermined locations, there is no way to obtain cash as the game is completely linear automatically taking you from chapter to chapter. As your characters gain experience and level up, they gain attributes in predetermined order. Once beorc characters hit level 21, they gain a cIass upgrade and start again from the beginning. As a change from Path of Radiance, the level cap for laguz has been raised to 40 and all beorc cIasses have gained an additional cIass upgrade. When certain characters have fought enough together, you can set them to support each other gaining a small skill bonus whenever within the range.  Graphics have never been the high point of Intelligent Systems' games and neither is it the case now. Path of Radiance was no beauty queen and strangely the graphics haven't improved at all. Some of the higher level magic effects are joy to look at but otherwise the game doesn't come even close to the best looking GameCube games and are simply dated on Wii. Intelligent hasn't even tried to mask how the game started off as a GameCube project - on any field. At least the cutscenes are still gorgeous, but now with more powerful systems available, I wish the game was on one of them so the whole game could look as good.  Besides the cutscenes, the whole story is told through long conversations with static cardboard cut-outs. The dialogue is vast and usually sharp. Ironically all of the characters remind cardboard cut-outs as none of their personalities go further than their cIass. Ike is your ordinary hero, Laura is ordinary priest, Skrimir your ordinary young lion prince and Soren your ordinary tactician. And as strange as it may sound, the conversations have no real widescreen support even though rest of the game does. It wouldn't be such a big problem if you didn't spend hours upon hours reading the dialogue. Widescreen could have really helped the presentation as if there is more than three persons in a conversation, all of them won't fit the screen at the same time.  Voice acting is quite rare in the game and you won't find it outside cutscenes and narration between missions. And frankly with the usual JRPG teen heroes, I couldn't stop laughing when I heard some of the characters for the first time. Especially the (very) young archer Oscar and Silver Haired Maiden Micaiah are quite something to listen to. Fortunately all of them aren't quite that bad and cutscenes only pop up once in five hours.  If there is a field where JRPG's usually shine, it's the score. Unfortunately in Radiant Dawn the music is rather generic. Some of the tracks have a chance to rise over the grey mass but lack the kick to become memorable. And the same problem continues with sound effects. A massive explosion that covers most of the screen sounds like a puff and attacking an enemy resembles bug squishing. Though this emphasizes the powerful critical hits which become more and more rewarding with flashier animations the longer you advance.  Radiant Dawn is a fan service. Old players of the series are hungering for more of the same, while newcomers may find the unforgiving difficulty and overall stuck-in-the-past feeling major turn-offs. Everything from the dated graphics to Game Boy controls and bad voice acting screams last-gen. Nearly everything from the gameplay to presentation could just as well be on Nintendo DS, only thing missing would be the beautiful cutscenes. The game still has the magical strategy feeling but all the small annoying flaws do a good job of burying it. As long as you can get past the first twenty hours, you'll get another good twenty out of it. It is often said that only Nintendo knows how to develop for Wii. As a first party developer, the lack of effort from Intelligent Systems is a real shame. Even though it's not a Wii game, it's the best strategy title on the Wii. If you don't count Path of Radiance that is.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Lego Star Wars and Lego Star Wars 2: The Original Trilogy were both successful Traveller’s Tales games that sparked a lot of interest in turning popular film franchises into lego games. Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga is a package game that combines both of the Lego Star Wars games, and it does so in a very smooth and effective way.  Lego Star Wars follows the story of all six Star Wars films and retells them using it’s charming gameplay and even more charming cutscenes. The basic story follows the Star Wars films, but minor details are changed, for comical effect more than anything and it certainly works in creating a fun game, that is definitely not just for children. The story is told through cutscenes which are incredibly charming and easy to love. All of the characters have voices and express their emotions by a series of grunts and actions. You will find yourself laughing and smirking throughout every cutscene. It is not a bad thing that there is no voice acting; it actually makes for a more enjoyable experience when playing through the story. All of the biggest moments of the saga are featured in the game e.g. the fall of Anakin, the birth of the Empire, the moment when Darth Vader reveals he is Luke’s father, although it’s slightly different in the game as he shows Luke a picture of him and his mother and grunts a few times. Overall, any part you can think of, Lego Star Wars includes it somewhere, and puts a nice twist on it to remind you this is a light-hearted game.  One of the most important things in the Star Wars films, alongside the great story, is the fantastic soundtrack, which is certainly not missing in Lego Star Wars. The most memorable tracks are ever so present throughout the game and the game does well to integrate tracks, for example, when you use the force on some tables and chairs, the infamous bar tune plays or when you build a jukebox in Jabba’s place, his minions come running to rock out to the dark side tune. The sound effects are great too. From the swinging of the light sabres to the firing of the blasters, everything is perfect. The sound does well to enhance the Star Wars experience. Not only does the game sound great, the game looks great too. Running in HD, the game looks very crisp and very clean. It is not a technical achievement by any means, but for this basic game, the graphics are very nice.  Lego Star Wars isn’t just about pretty graphics and a great story though, the game plays great too. It’s a pretty standard platformer, but standard isn’t a bad thing. There are many playable characters, and many character types. There are jedis and siths, druids, stormtroopers, bounty hunters, and more. Each character type can do different things and for most levels, you experience a good mix of characters. Once you have played through the story on a level, you can re-play the level on freeplay and pick your own character as well as change between several other characters in the middle of the level, which is useful for collecting items that would otherwise be out of reach. Throughout all of the levels, there are several items that you can collect. Collecting things can be both fun and irritating as you may go through an entire level just to collect something near the end of it, and not have the right character to be able to collect that item which means you have to play through it again. The story line is quite lengthy due to there being 6 levels in each of the episodes which means 36 levels in total. Most players will find themselves completing the game in around 12 hours.  A big problem with Lego Star Wars is replay value. Once you have finished the story, there are some things that you might want to go back and collect if you are into that sort of thing, but other than that, there are not that many options. There are a few extra side missions you can do, but they are pretty minimal. There are many extras that can be unlocked by finding Red Power Bricks throughout the levels, but they aren’t really worth it and in some places, make the game too easy and boring. You can play online with friends, but only friends, which limits the online experience more than it should. The Xbox 360 achievements are worth a mention due to them helping the game in terms of replay value, and also in terms of the humorous nature of a lot of them e.g. ‘Let the Wookie Win’ involves ripping off a certain number of enemy arms with a wookie  Lego Star Wars: Complete Saga does a great job of combining both Lego Star Wars games and updating them. The games, at their core, are still the same, loveable games that they were before. The story humour is fantastic and well worth seeing. The soundtrack is perfect in terms of the Star Wars franchise. The gameplay is fun enough, but the lack of real replay value is a big let down. It’s fun collecting things, but it gets tedious after a short time. For newcomers into Lego Star Wars, the game is great value for money as you are getting a lengthy and enjoyable game but for anybody who already owns or has played through both games previously, it’s not really worth buying this one again.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots is the latest title to come out the deranged mess that is Hideo Kojima’s mind and once again it raises the bar for storytelling in video games. Following on from the events in Metal Gear Solid 2, Solid Snake has aged. A lot. Yet the raspy old fellow is back for what has been heavily hinted at – his final mission. Rather than sticking the the one facility or area players will be able to switch between 5 locations across the globe hunting for Liquid Ocelot the main antagonist of the game. Spoilers aside the game does a very good job of salvaging something that resembles sense from the mess that many people found the closing hours of MGS2. The game succeeds in providing closure to the story that has spanned almost 21 years across 7 games. The story is not completely perfect however, you do come across several retcons in the game which is never good but many of them seem forced just to make the events of MGS3 and Portable Ops seem more relevant. As always the performances from the voice actors are nothing sort of incredible David Hayter once again brings amazing depth to Snake and in my opinion Metal Gear without Hayter is just dumb. The only minor complaint about the voices is Christopher Randolph’s (Otacon) inability to fake crying. I can’t quote the exact words for spoilers sake but he sounds cringe worthy all for the wrong reasons. Of course this is still a video game and the game play is also brilliant. However to Metal Gear aficionados they may have a problem with the more action orientated play rather than the stealthy game play we are used to. It definitely feels like at some point during this games development somebody played Gears of War and said ‘oh…’ The controls have also been modified and for the most part it’s for the better. The CQC (close quarters combat) system has been improved as it was just done on the one button rather than the 3 or 4 you would have had to use in Snake Eater. However I did miss being able to interrogate opponents which as far as I can tell has been excluded from the game. The motion sensing has also been used sparingly (which is good) simply having to shake if you want to return the camouflage to it’s original color and also using it to strangle people among other minor uses. It all works fairly well but I’d still be much happier having to push a button but that’s just my personal preference. The audio in this game is stunning, there is no denying Guns of the Patriots is the best sounding game for a long time, every little thing sounds perfect and sounds exactly like it should do. The game does have some minor issues, firstly the boss characters were a bit disappointing after such an amazing group of foes in MGS3. Sure its still beats other boss characters in other series but they are not of your usual Metal Gear caliber.\\xa0 Also whilst it is an excellent game it’s not such a good Metal Gear game. While you can be stealthy and try not to get spotting there is no real reason too. In past Metal Gear games if you got seen chances are you would be dead before you realized. Guns of the Patriots however Snake is heavily overpowered and any guard can be taken care of very quickly. It’s not a problem for the majority of gamers but fans of the series may find it slightly annoying that you can just Rambo the whole game. If you own a PS3 you owe it to yourself to buy Metal Gear Solid 4. Every console has had that small group of games that decades later it will be remembered for and Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots is one of those games for Sony’s machine.',\n",

       "  'description': \"It's been five years since Funcom started working on Age of Conan and now after many lengthy delays, AoC is finally out and ready to be judged by players and reviewers. Funcom's first MMO, Anarchy Online, had one of the worst launches in MMO history and subscriber numbers dropped faster than in any game before or after. Will Age of Conan face the same grim future as Anarchy Online or has Funcom learned their lesson?  If you are familiar with the work of Robert E. Howard or Schwarzenegger's spin-off movies, you'll know what to expect: blood and boobs. That alone doesn't sound very revolutionary but the fact that Age of Conan is the first MMO to have M rating gives it a new contrast. That plus a whole new real-time based combat system are the keys for a next generation MMORPG.  You will immediately be astonished by the amount of customization that can be done to your character, everything from tattoos to age and nose angle to bossom size can be changed with sliders. You won't find anything better from other MMOs or most singleplayer RPGs for that matter. Though don't expect to find any hairy green monsters from the character selection, you only have three human races to choose from as there's no pixies or orcs to be found in the low fantasy world of Hyboria. All of the three races have their real world counterparts: Stygians are the mysterious Egyptians, Aquilonians are the noble and civilized people of Rome and Cimmerians are the mighty northern barbarians.  As soon as you've created the character of your choice, you will be amazed by the quality of the graphics. Lush green jungles, fearsome Picts with the amount of small details closer to singleplayer titles than other MMOG's - the visuals easily top any of its competitors. Naturally this reflects to hefty system requirements, and if Lord of the Rings Online and World of Warcraft ran well for you, there's no guarantees for the same in Age of Conan. 2 gigabytes of ram is almost a must, and the low settings are unacceptably choppy for low-end systems, while still looking ugly. Unfortunately some of the areas don't stand up as well as others. Especially in instances you can smell the scent of copy paste and lack of detail.  As polished as the newbie area of Tortage is, you already feel the lack of variation after creating your second character. Unlike in many MMOs, there is only one newbie area, and you have to go through the same process with every new character. At least after leaving the newbie area, players are sent to their homelands so it's recommended to create a character of different race each time.  The basic gameplay isn't much different in Age of Conan. Actually, the only real difference is the collision detection and lack of auto targeting in melee. What it basically means is that all of your melee attacks can hit multiple targets in front of you rather than only the one that you have targeted. This brings a small new tactical aspect to the game as you have to worry about positioning more. Also, the combos, which are executed by pressing the direction keys in the correct order, are a nice addition and unless you want to end up at the closest graveyard, you'll have to fully focus on playing the game. Though with casters there isn't anything as refreshing going on and spell casting works the same way as in every other MMO, with the addition of spell weaving at later levels. During spell weaving, caster's damage output is increased at the cost of stamina drain, and if you run out of stamina, the weaving stance quickly drains your health to zero.  Conversations and quests are mainly very well written and some of the quests are even quite funny. This should come as no surprise as Funcom is also behind the fantastic Longest Journey series. As an example, an underground gang has kidnapped Fabio's princess and the protagonist is paid to rescue her. After fighting your way through several gangs, komodos and crocodiles in the sewers, you'll find out that the princess is just a cute little puppy. Rescuing a puppy doesn't exactly fit the picture of my evil necromancer.   Quests are mainly the usual kill X number of baddies and collect X number of goodies, which we've used to live with ever since EverQuest, although the possibility to actually converse with alternate lines is a nice and fresh change from the normal accept/decline-option in MMOs to a more singleplayer feeling. Sadly, the quest sources suddenly dry up near late thirties and you spend half of the time searching for working quests. Sooner or later you'll have to become acquainted with Mr. Grind. Fortunately Grind is a lot more forgiving than his brothers in other MMOs. The amount of experience points you gain is a lot more considerable than in most other games, though with the maximum level of 80, there are quite a few levels to grind. Luckily there are few quests that can be repeated as many times as you want - boring, yes, but effective.  Even as beautiful as some of the areas are, all of them feel more or less artificial with mountains bordering every region and predetermined passages to other areas. Talking to a guide will immediately teleport you to some distant land, making the world feel a lot smaller than it actually is and a major part of the immersion vanishes on the way. Fully instanced world comes with other problems too. Rather than adjusting the spawn rates to fit the number of players currently in the region, Funcom divides all players on different carbon copies of the same area, making you unable to see or team up with most of the people on the server. There are often dozen copies of the same area running at the same time and if one instance doesn't have enough players, the server bluntly closes it down kicking everyone in the instance out of the game. Getting disconnected three times in a row, just to wait three minutes in a queue after every incident, artificial walls and bugs don't exactly help the immersion either.  Servers are divided to three main types, PvE, PvP and Culture-PvP. Player versus Environment and Player versus Player servers also have roleplaying variants. PvE is your normal carebear server, where players can't attack other players outside PvP specific areas. PvP on the other hand, is pure free-for-all gankfest. And it's not going anywhere for a while, as the number of players stuck between levels 50-80 is growing all the time. Whine even a bit about the raping, or anything else for that matter, and you are lucky to get even one friendly reply. Not exactly the kind of community you'd expect from a Mature rated game. Culture PvP is the strange middle ground, where you can only attack players of different culture. I wonder if Funcom gave the idea much thought before implementing it, as Stygians are mostly mages while Aquilonians and Cimmerians don't have mages at all. Just think what it would be like if Horde had no mages and Alliance wouldn't have anything else.  Fortunately the servers itself have been very stable and during the month of playing, I haven't experienced almost any lag at all and the servers have only been down for patch maintenances. Ignoring the bugs, this is the stablest MMO launch to date next to Lord of the Rings Online.  It won't take long before you find out that Age of Conan has effectively no death penalty. If you die, you end up at the closest respawn point with a very minor debuff. And if you happen to go back to the same place, like you usually do to finish the quest, you can click your gravestone to get rid of the debuff. If another player happens to kill you, there is absolutely nothing to lose, no item repairs, no XP loss and not even a debuff, you won't even lose your active buffs. Although anything more than a strong debuff might be too cruel after getting ganked three times in a row.  During the very first weeks of early access and launch, most bosses dropped no loot at all, so there was no good reason at all to kill them. Funcom has fixed some of that, but still the majority of boss drops are worse than item rewards from ten levels lower quests; my necromancer had the same robe from level 15 to 45. That was until I found out that most of the robe bonuses had no real affect, as there are also some very interesting character development issues. For example bumping your run speed skill doesn't seem to have any real affect on your running speed and as long as your casting concentration is higher than zero, your spells won't be interrupted so spending more than one point on concentration is currently a waste of points. In addition, some feats don't work properly, and increasing base stats has no real effect on the inflicted damage meaning that two barbarians of the same level are nearly identical in terms of damage.   And that's not all, there are even more problems with the basic mechanics. Does it sound right that female characters swing their weapons about a quarter slower than male? That means female characters make about quarter less damage over time than males. Sprinting works like in any other game, or at least it should; you sprint until you run out of stamina and repeat once your stamina has regenerated. Unfortunately stamina regeneration is not percentage-based, whereas stamina usage is, so the higher your level is, the less you can sprint, because at lower level your stamina regenerates to full a lot faster than at higher level.  There are also some minor problems with the user interface and especially the group part. If a party member ventures more than 50 meters far from rest of the group, he completely disappears from the map and there are some silly occasions in dungeons when the group tries to find the lost herd. Depending on whether you are an old-school RPG fan or want as user friendly experience as possible, the fully fledged GPS system will either be a pro or con for you. The same can be said about customizabilty of the UI, or the lack of it. Some might want every help possible while others prefer everyone to have the same tools at hand.  The bugs alone wouldn't be a problem but when half of the promised content is nowhere to be seen, there is quite something to complain about. Where did drunken brawling go? Or most of the end-game content? Especially guild cities don't currently seem to have any real purpose and that was one of the biggest selling points of the game. And unlike the game box claims, there's no real support for DirectX10, as it was left out just before the release to be added later this year through a patch.  As far as the in-game customer support goes, Funcom appears to be caught off-guard by the popularity of the game and there are basic level problems with the in-game support tools that don't exactly help the issue. Petition response times are often counted in days, and you have to stay online for a response to be possible; if a GM happens to get to your problem at 4 AM while you are sleeping, you get a reply stating that as you weren't online the GM couldn't help you. Your petition is then closed and you get a suggestion to re-petition the issue - back to the end of the queue. There is also no phone support for billing or account problems, so if you can't log in, your best bet is to send an email and pray.  Good audio can save a lot and Age of Conan is definitely not lacking on that field. Fantastic music, great sound effects and good voice acting in the newbie area – audiovisual side is definitely the strong point of Age of Conan.   There is definitely a good ground to build on here but in its current state, Age of Conan is not worth the purchase or the monthly fee. The game sure is fun until level 40 or so but I have better things to do with my time and money than wait for the next patch that will hopefully fix all the problems. For now I'm canceling my subscription and hoping for a better tomorrow. I can't wait to see what the game looks like in a year.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Since being announced Mass Effect has gained (excuse the term) mass media attention helped by BioWare's stunning track record for RPG's on Microsoft's original Xbox along with promise that the adventure would span not just the single worlds we are used to but entire galaxies waiting for you to restore peace.The first part of a promised trilogy sets you as Commander Shepard who is fully customisable both male and female Shepard's are available both with a wide set of customisation options heck, you can even change the back story for your character which however limited (3 options) is still impressive considering the impact it will have on other characters in the game.The story gets off to a great start. You and your team have been sent to one of Earths new colonies in search of ancient technology although as always with RPG's nowadays things go disastrously wrong the events leading to a hunt across the galaxy for an enemy bent on releasing a catastrophe.I would love to go into more detail but I would hate to ruin the experience but the story is great. Unfortunately however it is short-lived the main storyline (side-quests aside) will take 10 hours, 12 tops which considering this is predominantly an RPG is slightly disappointing.The side-quests are much bigger than most you would expect also sending you to a variety of planets. Most of these assignments are minor trivialities compared with the main story but are still entertaining however small in scope.The game promises a huge galaxy to explore and it delivers. The large areas you visit are wonderful to explore however the huge areas are limited. Most of the planets not used for the main story and instead are only used for side quests and are just fairly generic 'jungle planet', 'volcano planet' and are not terribly interesting.The role-playing elements work fantastically, the game is incredibly cinematic experience with every single line of dialogue spoken aloud with truly amazing sound quality. The voice actors aren't cheap either they all do a brilliant job really immersing you in the world. Calling the games sound quality amazing would be an understatement. Every piece of music also suits each area and looking back at the game I can't think of one track that sounded silly or out of place.If you come to Mass Effect expecting a shooter, you are playing the game wrong. The shooting elements work well it is third person based similar to how Gears of War worked but the similarity stops there. You can shoot a gun at enemies that's it. As far as I can tell there is no extra damage taken into account for headshots or wherever else you shoot. The whole shooting system is fairly generic but it's by no means bad. It works well considering the game is meant to be played as an RPG and not a shooter.Mass Effect looks great although you won't be blown away if you've played other high profile games recently but it looks great and has that sci-fi feel that will keep that kind of audience happy. Often the game will play before the textures have fully loaded so characters will look kind of bland for a few seconds it's annoying but doesn't really hurt the game but it is a shame as it takes you out of what is otherwise an engrossing game.Overall Mass Effect is a quality game that will be remembered for many years to come a few technical issues here and there coupled with the main storyline's short length upset what is otherwise an amazing game. It is easily the best RPG currently available for the Xbox 360.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'It might at first glance sound odd to talk about reviewing an oldie here, for as far as we know it from the music industry oldies can mostly be found in the 50\\'s, 60\\'s or 70\\'s; and this is an era where the roots of Shadowgrounds obviously don\\'t lie. But, in the fast moving world of computer entertainment, even games having been released only 2 years ago must sometimes be afraid to be put rather quickly into the nursing home of gaming history. Shadowgrounds is one of these games that shouldn\\'t be abandoned to that kind of fate. Want to know why? Read on.It\\'s basically about … ah well, we probably do have an oldie here … shooting things. You are Wesley Tyler and you are on that colonised planet, which was really awesome, but, to put it short, it\\'s not that awesome anymore when you arrive in the game. So your mission basically is to transform it back to awesomeness, which you mostly, if not only, do with upgrading weapons that you will find on your way and using them against hordes of enemies. Oh yes, there is also a story to it, which means that mostly in cut scenes you will meet some people on your way commanding you at first to find some keycard, secondly to shoot things and then eventually deciding to die. Which is of course very much supported by an alien race; these are the ones you shoot at because you don\\'t like friends getting killed in cut scenes. Not to forget the crates standing around everywhere, which you can also … oh, you know that one, don\\'t you?But of course I wouldn\\'t write this text if it weren\\'t for the fact that I sincerely want to recommend this game to you out there, so let\\'s stop with the endless enumeration of somehow really antiquated elements and quickly skip to the fact that this game is just some very solid, funny and motivating fun.The foundation of this is the atmosphere which the developers were able to achieve with means as simple as the lighting of your surroundings and the music accompanying you on your journey. While you are walking through the several indoors and outdoors environments, they quite often don\\'t look as boring as they actually are: and this is achieved with the help of illumination and even nowadays rather good-looking effects supporting that. This is where your flashlight comes in, because you will want to switch that on when you are entering low-lit or even pitch-dark areas, while you hear footsteps, grunting noises and other noises you, to put it simple, just don\\'t ever want to hear; especially with the lights switched off and even more especially when you know that some friends just recently got killed by the source of these strange noises in a scripted sequence. This flashlight is not just a nice but useless accessory, it rather adds a tactical component to the gameplay. Some enemies will run away from the light, some will be pulled towards you by it and when you proceed you will also get to know enemies that you can only see in the light you cast. The flashlight also adds to the atmosphere with the shadows that it throws, making it sometimes very difficult to distinguish between a harmless shadow and a deathly monster lurking in the dark. The sound and music do a very good job too, being well composed and context-sensitive.The upgrades that you will find for your weapons during the game are the biggest motivation that it will give you, and they are not useless after all. Every upgrade is somehow effective, but of course you will never be able to acquire all of them. And, not surprisingly: Upgrades for powerful weapons cost more than upgrades for your standard pistol. Although I would like to encourage you to push this pistol to its limits and to then try it out on some really dangerous enemies later on in the game, instead of pulling the minigun out. I had very much fun only using the pistol; although I sometimes had to pay with death. Which led to repeating the whole level.What did you just say? \"Dude, press the Reload button?\" Oh, I\\'m afraid to tell you this, but: there is no such thing. You\\'ve got five tries per level, and if you fail with these you will just have to start it all over again. This very rarely happened to me and I have to say that the game is not really easy, but mostly fair, so this absence of free saving didn\\'t really demotivate me. It might be antiquated, but: We\\'re talking about an oldie here, right?But we are, to get this right, not talking about a game for old computers. If you really want the lighting effects and the game to work on very high details, your machine should not be much older than the game itself, I\\'m afraid. This is in some ways not understandable, because apart from the effects there\\'s nothing really ravishingly beautiful to this game. However: I played it with medium settings and it didn\\'t affront my eyes seriously.So if you are not into shooters you have probably closed this posting long ago. If you need an intelligent story you should at the latest close it now. But if you would like some motivating, challenging, sometimes scary and mostly pleasant game in which you don\\'t have to invest too much time (and if you probably liked Expendable back in 1999), then you should really consider buying this one, which shouldn\\'t cost you much anymore. And which is, by the way, also playable in a co-op mode with four friends via Gamepads.In this case, tell your friends not to forget to shoot at the crates. You already knew that?',\n",

       "  'description': \"Who's crazy idea was this!? Uno on the Xbox 360? Surprisingly however its great fun and arguably one of the best games on Live Arcade.Its a bright and colourful game that is great to look at and due to (mostly payed for) downloadable content, There is plenty of room to change the playing field and deck of cards.I think the best thing you can say about the graphics is that they are all you would want from a game of Uno on the system.Like above the sound is just as you would expect, you get your card shuffling and your 'Uno!' chime when you well... have one card left. The music is relaxing but irritating at the same time, I mean what kind of music would suit Uno?Luckily to make up for this the game supports custom soundtracks so you can listen to whatever you fancy. There is also an option to just turn the music off entirely and still be able to hear sound from the cards themselves. Which tends to suit the game better as thats how cards are generally played in real life.The game plays just as you would expect, You select your card wait for everybody else to play theirs and press 'X' when you have Uno or risk being caught out and having to draw a couple of cards.The only reason you would really want this (or any card/ casino based game on Live) is to play online. It's not that the single player its rubbish it's just why would you want to play single player? it supports the headset so plenty of trashtalk (on Uno?) and also the vision camera. Although a word of warning you WILL se a naked person. It's only a matter of time. Within three hours of playing I saw a....... Well you get the idea.Unfortunately it doesn't support offline multiplayer on one hand this is kind of sensible as you could see each others cards but it's still worth mentioning.The achievements are fairly simple to get. Minus the one where you have to 'bluff' All of the achievements will eventually be gained through normal play. The win 40 times one will take you a long time as Uno is based on luck rather than skill so you may never get that one depending on your lucky stars.The theme of this review is generally is that Uno for the Xbox 360 is all you would want from a game of Uno on the Xbox 360. Thats good for all you Uno fans out there. But however insanely addictive the game is, there isn't a lot of action to interest most people. At 400 points it isnt a full priced game and rightly so, If you like a bit of fun and easy achievements then by all means get Uno, but this isn't going to interest everyone.\",\n",

       "  'description': '\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Unreal tournament games, in the past, have been wildly popular games, especially when looking at games such as Unreal Tournament 2004. These games have been referred to as \"twitch shooters\" as they are very fast paced, and the name \\'Unreal\\' really does fit the theme of the game. The game is based on frantic, over-the-top game play that seemed to be enough to satisfy players in the old days, but just does not seem to satisfy the \\'modern warfare\\' hungry players today. The weapons, like the sludge-spewing biorifle and laser-firing shock rifle, are unreal, the maps are unreal, and the gameplay is unreal. Stop playing those untra-realistic games and try something a bit more unreal!\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 While the game does have a singleplayer campaign, the Multiplayer online portion of the game is where the fun is at. Unreal Tournament 3 takes what made the old Unreal Tournament games of the series and does not really seem to change that formula. The game is still insanely addictive, fast paced, and filled with \"WOW\" moments. One example of a \\'WOW\\' moment is the random occurance of snagging an air headshot with the sniper rifle while plummeting to the ground. It really is moments like this that seem to bring the UT community together and keep the franchise going. While the core gameplay has remained the same, there have been some minor tweaks that strengthen the gameplay (much like a patch). For example, the sniper rifle is the only long range weapon with a scope now, as the lightning gun has been removed. There are many different modes of play, most of which were in previous UT games. There is team and nonteam deathmatch, capture the flag, duel, and warefare. While captuer the flag and deathmatch are obvious, warefare is a mode in which players must control nodes on the map which, when controlled, open up the enemies base to attack. All of these modes are fun and exciting and can all be played against humans and with AI bots. These bots are also fun to play against, and are regarded by many people as being some of the best AI opponents in the industry.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The singleplayer in UT games has never been extremely impressive and it does not change that here. If you are looking for a great, detailed singleplayer story, you will not find it in UT games. The single player in Unreal Tournament 3 is composed of a collection of random bot matches, which are strung together by a weak, uninspired story. The story is based on a war between a bunch of mercanaries that want revenge for the destruction of their planet. This is a big, and mostly unwelcomed, change to the UT story as the stories in the past have been based on a huge, life-threatening tournament. Anyways, the singleplayer can be enjoyed alone, or online with others. When played with others, the lame story can be overlooked and there is some fun to be had.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 All in all, Unreal Tournament 3 is a great game and really seems to refresh that faced-paced shooter subgenre. If you are ever in the mood to truly test your aiming skills while flying 20 feet in the air, UT3 is the game to pick up. Sometimes it is nice to take a break from all those army, realistic games and try something a little unreal. It takes everything from the older UT games and makes them better. Whether you play this one the PC, PS3, or XBOX 360, don\\'t miss the next great UT game.',\n",

       "  'description': \"This title definitely has me in two minds. The moment I finished it, I felt compelled to play it through again and drink in the ambience of Stark and Arcadia. I was willing to overlook the fairly minimal gameplay and occasionally stilted animation, as the overall presentation knocked me for a six and I found the story meaningful and slightly melancholy.The major problem with that story is, the game fails to finish it. There is a distinct lack of closure quite different to the rather enchanting ending of Funcom's seminal Longest Journey game. This is frustrating! I wait with baited breath for the conclusion to this story.As I said, the presentation is beautiful, if a little dated. I played it a couple of years after it was released; still, the art design is fantastic, and the music score and voice acting are phenomenal. Dreamfall's production values really help to carry the story along.That said, Dreamfall suffers greatly from its lofty ambitions to present an 'interactive movie' of sorts. It strips back a little too much in the way of gameplay. One of the great virtues (and at times frustrations) of Funcom's previous titles was its puzzles. There are unfortunately no difficult puzzles in Dreamfall; these seem to have been traded in for lacklustre combat and stealth mechanics which are a little too easy (even for me, a fairly casual gamer).Dreamfall is great at what it sets out to do - convey a meaningful story. However, as a video game, I have a slightly different set of expectations than I would for more conventional storytelling. It leaves much to be desired and improved upon, but by the same token it leaves a strong mark. I highly recommend giving it a try (there's a free trial available) if you're looking for something story-driven but perhaps a little less intense than Bioshock or Mass Effect.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Let me expain my love and desire for a game like Big Rigs. I first encountered it in 2005 when I watch GameSpot's Alex Navarro playing this masterful game and reaching to a conclusion of only giving it a 1.0. Now my expectations for this game was low, so I decided to buy it off Ebay for 99p and here I am, in 2008 still playing this addicting game and realised that Big Rigs blows every other racing game out of the water!My first reactions to playing this game was WOW! I had a pretty high spec machine with a Geforce 8800gts and still had trouble with the frame rates in places. Make no mistake, Big Rigs is as demanding as a PS3 or an Xbox 360 game, and to think it came out 3 years before any of those consoles even appeared in the market! Is Big Rigs better than Gran Turismo 4? Well, some could argue that they are two different types of games and yes they are, but in the end, Big Rigs beats it because of how much fun and replay value is in this game. Thought GTA4 or Oblivion was big? Think again, Big Rigs' maps never end and are seemingly infinite in possiblilities.All these years the simple things I wanted from a game: Controls, Freedom, and a chance to win fair. Big Rigs answered all of that. I was able to drive up mountains, drive everywhere, drive through water, and most of all, my opponent. He just stays there, feeling like a loser, but that doesn't bother me at all, as Big Rigs has teached me that I'm always a winner when it comes to finishing a race! YOU'RE WINNER! My heart stops beating and I fall unconcious on the floor every time. I've really got to stop playing this game before I end up dying with pleasure! I love spinning backwards at 1,000,000mph! This really is a space age game and is full of adrenaline packed fun!It's nice to see that Big Rigs has a ton of variety, easily comparing it to a game like Spore or The Sims 2. The Russian geniuses behind this game, Stellar Stone, must have thought to try somethink unique and innovative since there wasn't many games around that actually used Big Rigs as the protagonists of the game. However, make no mistake, Big Rigs does have challenges which are the police road blocks and the police themselves trying to stop you from hauling cargo from travelling in America. They are invisible so its alot harder than it sounds, but thankfully the truck does come with some cool features like unlimited acceleration, ghost mode, and extra grip tires to help you fight off these challenges. The only bad thing I can think of in Big Rigs is the lack of MMO multiplayer, wouldn't it be fun driving around with others on the same map in a truckload of Big Rigs!?!?I can't describe how much Big Rigs changed my life, and many others around me. You can only experience it yourself. If you want to be a winner, or want the perfect game, then make sure it's Big Rigs. You won't be disappointed. I'd give this amazing game a 10/10 and its quite possibly the best racing game ever made! Just hear the Techno music! If that don't make you fall in love with this game then nothing will!

       "  'description': \"I personaly would of rather of had Battlefield 3 for PC because Battlefield 2 and 2142 were just phenominal but i certainly found the Battlefield Bad Company\\xa0 great!! Its got a great single player, which is exclusive to this game. The multiplayer is also very fun, in my opinion the 24 player cap and the gold rush is good, but call of duty's multiplayer or even battlefield 2s online is way funner. Im not going to go to indepth in this review i would just like to say, if your a fan of battlefield or FPSs, much sure you rent or buy this game, its Awesome!My rating scale depends on the platform and genre its on. Since PC has much more awesome games on it, i mark much harder on it so a 80% on PC would mean its great compared to the hundreds of other awesome PC games of that genre, and might be better than a 98% of consoles. A great game is a great game, on the system. I like to keepy my reviews short and sweet, so i wont bore you and get to the point. If theres an official review out on Giant Bomb, you should definately read it because they are the best reviewers in the worlds! =DGameplay 8/10Graphics 9/10Fun 8/10Replay 8/10Single+Multiplayer 9/10Overall =\\xa0 42/50\\xa0 =\\xa0 84% \",\n",

       "  'description': \"The Swedish steel is the toughest around when it comes to massive multiplayer mayhem! Battlefield 2 proves that point! \\t\\t\\tThe Good:  Great deal for your money, Squad System, Map Sizes, Excellent graphics, Points System, Commander feature, Built-In VOiP.  The Bad:  Takes time to load maps, A bit slow to load with 512 mb ram, patches often bring along a bug or two, no in-game friends list. Game tends to feel a bit unbalanced when fighter-jets bomb everything and blow up everything in the air.  When releasing a game like Battlefield 1942, and seeing how much of a success it is and how loved it is by so many fans, taking the 2nd installment to the modern day era might be risky to some. But Battlefield 2 loses none of it's charm and improves on pretty much every way from BF42 to BF2. The squad system is just revolutionary, it really brings random people together alot more than ever before in a multiplayer game. Being rewarded for certain team actions like healing, resupplying and all makes this game even more teamplay friendly which is just.. Awesome!  What makes Battlefield 2 so great is the action. BF42 felt a bit odd when it came to infantry action, it was all plasticy and such, but BF2 feels like a solid shooter, taken online and with 64 players! What's also cool is that you can unlock new weapons, every point you earn in the game adds to your account and once you get a certain number of points, you can unlock a new weapon to use in the battle. Every kit has one unlockable weapon. And you earn points by just helping. You can give ammuntion to soldiers who have been out and gunning for a while, heal injured ones, you even get points for sitting in a vehicle when the gunner kills someone, taking and assisting flag capture, flag defending, repairing base-equipment etc etc. There is just loads of ways to earn points. And since most people want to unlock weapons and etc, they will heal you and resupply your ammo stock since they want points! And this way, there is almost always a will for teamplay amongst the team!  What's also great is the maps, every map comes in three sizes. 16, 32 and 64 player versions. They don't differ in terms of design but more in base placement, flag positions which you must hold and take over and how powerful artillery strikes your commander can call down. 16 player is often just infantry based, you are given light transport vehicles and at most one tank. At 32 there is often a mix between infantry, vehicles and sometimes aircraft. At 64 there is almost always aircraft, tanks and etc. And there are about 9-10 maps or something and they all come in three sizes so it feels more like the double or triple sometimes!   And yes, artillery you say, that's new huh! One soldier on each team can become a commander, he has a map where he can tell his squads where to attack, drop down vehicles, supply drops (which replenish your health and ammunition and repairs damaged vehicles), UAV scans which reveals enemies on the radar and artillery strikes. The commander has direct access to all the squads on the team and can clearly see what kits they are using like Assault kit, Anti-tank kit and so forth, so he can put a squad with alot of anti-tank kits on attack to flank a tank that's inbound and set a assault-based squad on flag capture. Sure most squads don't listen but this is a great feature for those who want teamplay.  That said, the whole game is there, and so is the graphics which looks amaaaazing when bumped up to max. It just looks gorgeous and is just thrilling to play! It's sounds alot and alot better than it's predecessor, the game has alot of good sounds for everything. Nothing feels out of place except if you put the volume quality on Low, but heh, you get what you pay for!  So well, you like infantry battles, vehicles and just the feel and rush of a war going on combined with that Xbox 360 points hunt feel? You've got it all here. If you liked the BF series, you are going to love this, this is simply in my humble opinion the best MP shooter out there and one that is just tremendous fun with friends!   Bring your friends into a squad play and just have loads of fun!\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'THE Music rhythm game.',\n",
       "  'description': \"What's better than having one music god? Having four music gods. That's the overall message that Rock Band seems to shout at every possibility, why? Because it's true. As a multiplayer experience, Rock Band is without a doubt the best music rhythm game to date and arguably one of the best games ever.Without sounding too overdramatic, lets go over some of the finer points of the game itself. Within Rock Band you are immediatly given a choice of 4 instruments to play (unless you purchased the game by itself, leaving you the choice of vocals via a Xbox Live headset and guitar via a Guitar Hero guitar.) Each of these are incredibly varied (Bass and Guitar are more diverse than in Guitar Hero) and offer hours of entertainment. Vocals can be performed with any USB Microphone but the Rock Band package comes equipped with one anyway, so hey, why not. The singing performs very similar to the popular Singstar series where you must sing the correct notes which appear on screen as bars. This may put some off but given you're allowed to sing in any octave you want, it's alot more welcoming than many would assume, specially on the Easy and Medium difficulty settings. The biggest criticism with the vocals is that without prior knowledge of the games lengthy setlist, it can be incredibly hard to sing some tracks, but this is down to personal taste, but it's true that here the game is a victim of it's own length.Guitar and Bass are very similar to Guitar Hero in that they are played in the same fashion with the differences being merely cosmetic (Hammer-on's are smaller notes as opposed to lit up, Star Power is re-titled Overdrive.) The difficulty for these instruments is noticably different to that of Guitar Hero 3. Since Guitar Hero 3 is designed to be a more solitary experience the difficulty is higher than Rock Band's social 4-way system, this is very noticable when I (while not the best player out there) can play Expert on Rock Band and often struggle with Hard on Guitar Hero 3.Drums are an entirely new aspect to the Music Rythm genre and are to a word... Awesome. The system works very similar to that of the guitar and bass where the notes scroll down screen and the correct 'notes' must be hit at the correct time. Difference is the orange 'note' is replaced with a foot pedal and appears as a bar which covers the entire note (thus making it hard to visually miss.) This system seems initially daunting but is actually very welcoming and user-friendly. I would strongly suggest you start on either the easy or medium difficulty settings as the higher up ones are... well terrifying. Another strong plus for this instrument choice is if you play it long enough to be able to play Expert, it can help you learn to play drums in real life. My main criticism with the drum kit however is the foot pedal itself is at times unresponsive and hard to hit fast repeatedly, however this may be down to my own kit.Rock Band's setlist is incredibly strong, ranging from classics such as Highway Star and Paranoid to more recent hits like When You Were Young and Dani California. As previously noted, the songs you are unfamiliar with make vocals alot harder, for example, I can ace Epic and Black Hole Sun but others struggle due to no knowledge of it's tune. (90's ftw.) However, this is by no means a fault, the massive variety in the setlist makes it very accesible meaning nearly anyone can pick up a controller and find something they can happily play along with, and even then, there's always DLC...Rock Band's DLC is one of it's strongest points, offering hours of extra gameplay to those who would believe they'd seen it all, the DLC currently on offer is incredibly varied and has something for everyone (Roxanne and Hammerhead anyone?) Also, given it carries onto Rock Band 2 and is incredibly good value for money, you never feel like you were ripped off, which is good, because you weren't.Online Rock Band is a very enjoyable experience, while only offering 2 modes (Tug of War and Score Duel) both are deep and fun enough to keep you coming back for more. However, I personally was very let down by the lack of World Tour (The mode where atleast 2 instruments play together, guitar & bass, drums & vocals etc.) online support? Surely this would've been the obvious addition... Specially given the solo options on offer.As a solitary experience, Rock Band is still a blast to play, but can drag on at times, specially with songs you are unfamiiar with. The guitar's difficulty can be a blessing or a curse depending on what you want from the game, if you want to play until your fingers bleed, get Guitar Hero 3, if you want to play along to your favourite tracks, get Rock Band. Vocals can drag on alone, also, it may raise a few eyebrows when a friend can hear you singing 'Bend me, break me...' distantly in your best female impression. Drums are still enjoyable alone (and hard...) but Rock Band was clearly designed to be played with a friend... or three.Cost aside, (Seen the price of the European edition?!) Rock Band is one of the best packages currently on the market, it has very strong replay value, a good sense of fun with friends and one of the best setlists (DLC included) ever made. What can I say? You really haven't lived until you've given Rock Band a try, it's social, it's crazy, it's always gonna keep you coming back for more and the most important part. It's fun.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"I recently decided to play through Super Mario World again and I must say: This still is a great game! The gameplay for example: The jumping still feels great and the flying with the cape never gets old. To differ from the earlier games in the franchise, they decided to add in Yoshi, who can stomp and swallow certain enemies. This adds another extra layer of depth to the game, that just keeps you interested and offers extra solutions to the (simple) problems you face in the game.The enemies vary from Koopa's (The dudes with the shields) to Ghosts (You know, Ghosts) and even Dinosaurs and Moles! The bosses are pretty easy to figure out, although you will fail some of them on the first time you try to beat them. The final boss encounter, with Bowser ofcourse is pretty much the hardest time you'll get within this game, mainly because when you fail, you have to fight your way through his castle all over again. Luckily you have different routes you can take to get to him.When you are done, there are soo many more secrets to be discovered, such as extra levels and hidden paths on your way to bowser.I still had a ton of fun with Super Mario World again, even after the 17 (!) it has been since this game came out!If you can't get hold of the SNES version, you should definately try to get your hands on the Virtual Console version or the GBA game that goes under the name of Super Mario 2 GBA.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"The crux of the issue with a triple A title such as Metal Gear Solid 4 is that fan expectations intersect violently with Sony's need to bring more casual gamers to the fray.\\xa0 Sony's immense market share lead has dwindled, and with a last-place-in-the-standings ranking (at least in the American market), MGS4 presents to the public the first major title that cannot be bought on a rival system.\\xa0 Well...yet.Gone are the clumsy  stealth mechanics that made immersion a chore.\\xa0 The core of MGS4's gameplay instead includes a mix and mash of third person shooter along with simplified sneaking abilities.\\xa0 Players used to being forced to sneak around will find themselves able to do this at a much more highly refined rate thanks to the new OctoCamo system as well as blissfully  simple pick-and-play controls.\\xa0 The controller, for the first time in the series, deserves none of the blame when you make a screw up.The major change is the essence of Tactical Espionage Action: in its place is the ability to run and gun without always running into heavy punishments as a result of death.\\xa0 That isn't to say that stealth should be foregone, but there are periods of this title that play more akin to sequences from a Rambo film rather than the traditional style of sneaking around corners and hoping that the guy you are about to choke does not use a sixth sense to sense you are right there.\\xa0 Keeping with the Rambo parallel, the player will find their selection of weaponry to be extremely high in this title.\\xa0 The collection of guns you receive throughout the game can be customized, from adding grenade launchers or shotgun barrels to rifles, to laser or optical sights, to mounts to stabilize Snake's aim.\\xa0 Guns that are ID Locked can be cleaned by Drebin, a gun launderer with a peculiar companion at his side.\\xa0 Like is the case in the entire MGS series, Drebin falls into the same pratfalls of having external knowledge of situations and becomes quite arduous to listen to during long diatribes.\\xa0 And you WILL have to brave long diatribes to complete this title.\\xa0 Excess weapons are cashed in for currency, called Drebin Points, which allow the player to buy new parts for guns, ammunition, and bulk numbers of silencers.The Drebin Point schematic can be accessed at any point of the game save Codec sequences or cut scenes.\\xa0 If you run low on ammunition in a fire fight, no need to fret: just access the menu and purchase as much ammunition as you can afford.\\xa0 Collecting as many Drebin points as possible also avails itself as a way to get your fetch on, or to kill as many enemy PMCs as possible.\\xa0 You can take these points with you after you complete the title, so if a player wants to purchase some of the more expensive weaponry, they can take what they had from their last run through the game with them into a new one.The story is simple.\\xa0 In that Hideo Kojima way.\\xa0 While others may be more equipped to speak on all the things going on in this franchise's forth installment, it is a safe bet that this title will answer a majority of the questions players have as to the meaning behind what has been going on throughout Metal Gear's twenty year history.\\xa0 Like puzzle pieces trickling down like Tetris blocks, the story both informs the player yet at the same time drives up the intrigue of what they are playing for.\\xa0 Needless to say, you will feel the need to discuss what you just witnessed once you have completed the title.The graphical prowess of the PlayStation 3 is at full force in this title.\\xa0 While some textures lack details, the depth of the palette is inarguable.\\xa0 During my play through of the game, I suffered no choppiness in frame rate, and the details with the characters was immense.\\xa0 The XBox 360, at this stage, seems incapable of duplicating the small finite details on the characters, as is displayed throughout the title.\\xa0 The game is the prettiest out there for our current systems.That said, the game is not without flaws.\\xa0 With new mechanics comes a level of refinement, but at the same time, Snake quite simply feels like an overpowering character.\\xa0 Perhaps too overpowering.\\xa0 A draw to the series has been the opportunity based combat, the need to survey and execute.\\xa0 In this title, punishment is usually not severe enough to stop a player from breezing through heavily guarded areas because Snake has enough weaponry to sustain the Iraqi insurgency.\\xa0 While this is appealing at times, at others it makes the game far too easy to beat.\\xa0 During major boss battles, and retro-goodness moments involving Metal Gear on Metal Gear carnage, the gameplay is not punishing enough to force the player to step up to the level of what is on screen.\\xa0 Which makes the game feel even more like a BluRay DVD you sometimes hit buttons on rather than a completely engrossing gaming experience.\\xa0 The second half of the game becomes belabored by more and more cut scenes which seem to grow in length.\\xa0 Some major conflicts become split screened as well, making keynote moments extremely hard to follow without failing the mission.\\xa0 It is as if Hideo Kojima was unsure of just how much control to give players of his game, or top not take their eyes off the story he is trying to weave.\\xa0 This sort of pandering makes for a scatterbrained experience.Also making the trip back into the Metal Gear Solid series are the Codec conversations that not only break the forth wall (SNAKE!\\xa0 Press the Action Button on your controller!), as well as the labored need to explain every single item or character's backstory to painstaking detail.\\xa0 You will be amazed how a discussion on diazepam can go on for five minutes with explanations of the properties it has,\\xa0  but this problem is magnified that I have had to sit through this sort of conversation with Snake three times over the course of the MGS series.\\xa0 Rather than let the world or the mythos speak to you, Kojima chooses to bludgeon the player in the skull with slices of the world and the war economy and rations rather than allowing interplay between in game world and the player.\\xa0 Again, this sort of storytelling belabors the points of the game that the player should at least have some awareness of.The AI also poses issues by falling into pratfalls that never seem to change in the franchise.\\xa0 I found myself during Act 1 pulling off headshots within the ruins of a building, only to have support come to the aid of fallen computer opponent.\\xa0 I would shoot him in the head.\\xa0 I can forgive this in this first instance, as it may be a logical way to approach the battlefield.\\xa0 But when guy number three comes down the pike and gets shot in the head, and then number four, I find myself wondering if I should feel a strong sense of shame because it feels exploitative to do something like this to poor AI opponents.\\xa0 I did nothing that complex, just shot.\\xa0 And the bodies hypothetically would have pilled up like the Tower of Babel if dead computer combatants not dissipated all Matrix style from the battlefield.\\xa0 I cannot praise enemy AI that allows this level of simplicity to the player.That said, the game has moments of fun, moments of introspection, and some rewarding play within the mythos of the franchise.\\xa0 Refinements and tweaks make for impressive improvements that hopefully can be improved upon in future Metal Gear titles.\\xa0 But do not be persuaded that this is somehow gaming perfection.\\xa0 AI gaffes and unbalanced storytelling mechanics are turn offs, and the relatively easy difficulty makes the game seem too brief.\\xa0\\xa0 Then, speeches about the Beauty and the Beast Corps member's backstories make the game seem too long.\\xa0 Metal Gear Solid 4 is still a solid purchase though, especially if your fandom of the franchise has not waned over the span of the sequels.\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'This game is amazing, truely amazing',\n",
       "  'description': 'Oblivion is the fourth installment in the Elder Scrolls series, it is developed by Bethesda and is easily one of the best games on the 360, but why is that? It is one of the best games because of four things. One, the 3 pronged combat system. Two, the exetremly impressive graphical quality. Three, the amazing writting and storylines. Four, the large amount of\\xa0value in this vast game.Combat makes or breaks an action game, if you don\\'t have good combat, then you dont have a good 1/4 -\\xa03/4 of a game. Oblivion is no acception to this rule, luckily, it abides by it entirely. The combat system in oblivion is very rubust and also quite fun. There is a huge tree of combat mechanics all branching off from three different types of combat. The first is melee combat; melee combat involves either a bladed weapon or a blunt weapon and attacking your foe with it. The second is bow and arrow combat which is fairly self-explanitory. The third is magic combat which does not just involve throwing fire balls and thunderbolts at your enemy, it stems out into five other schools of magic which stem out into many spells and spell combinations. The three original forms of combat all interwine to make the fighting in this game as exciting as ever. It is never a dull moment and I can guarantee with all these options avalible to both you and your enemies you will never have the same fight twice.Graphics are becoming more and more thought through and the critical requirements for graphics have steered quite a ways away from just the classic \"what looks good\" approach. Now games need to have many great animations, smoother framerates, and detailed textures. Oblivion delivers fairly well in these departments, but what makes the graphics so amazing is the amount of space you have to play in. There are many animations in the game, but its value comes as a drawback here because the game has over 150+ hours of things to do and even with the vast amount of animations you will end up seeing them many times. Another problem with the animations is that they have a feeling about them which seems a lot less human and a lot more robot. Humanoid characters move very staticy with some motions and will look awkward doing simple things like sitting down or jumping. As for the framerate, it is generally good. It will dip slightly when the game is loading a new section whilst you are running through the world, and it will slow down when there are too many items on screen or too many things are moving in one area. Fortunately, these framerate hiccups are few and far between and will not make the game unplayable in any way. Everything in the game looks real to a certain extent (that extent being that always prsent barrier between real life and a video game, and the fact that this is a fantasy game). All in all the game\\'s graphics leave just a little bit to be desired when it comes to animations, but the sheer scope the game more than compensates for that.RPGs are always known for their stories. Whether it be some Japanese RPG where the main character has amnesia and there is a little girl who ironicly has powers beyond anyones imagination, or some Western RPG where trechory and tradegy await you no matter what. Oblivion has some of the best storylines on the 360 and in the RPG market. And yes, you read that right, storylines. Plural. There are so many different storylines in this game it is amazing. Each sidequest, the main quest, the tens of factions you can join, and the expansions all culminate into hundreds of amazing storylines to keep you busy for hours. Each one is unique and will take you on quests of sometimes epic proportions. To keep these storylines going there is some spectacular writting that is voiced by some amazing voice actors and actresses. The downside of this is that there seems to be only 13 or so different voice actors. Tha game\\'s value draws it back too, but unlike the animations problem, this can get severly annoying. There are thousands of characters in the game and having only 13 people voice all of them is ridiculous. Luckily, those 13 actors are very good at what they do and deliver the writting well. The storylines in this game will leave you stunned, and I can assure you this: you will say, \"WTF!\" or, \"OH SNAP!\" or something along those lines many times through out your course of the game.Finally comes the value, you may have expected this section to be the longest, but it is explained fairly well in the previous three paragraphs so this section will remain relatively short. Oblivion is a game with over 150 (probably 200) hours of gameplay, and this is in one sitting. With the 1000s of different ways to play this game, you will probably play it through more than once. That ends up with potentially over 400 hours of gameplay, which is over two weeks of video gaming! This game will definately keep you busy for a long time, and that long time is one you will for surely enjoy.',\n",

       " {'deck': 'Skate manages to dethrone the king.',\n",
       "  'description': 'Since its premiere in 1999 the Tony Hawk series has been the king of the extreme sports genre. Not only did it make skating more mainstream but it helped revolutionize the extreme sports genre which up to that point consisted mainly of snowboarding titles. But as the Tony Hawk series continued with its yearly sequels the franchise lost some of its luster, almost becoming like the Madden series. So it’s a bit of a surprise that Electronic Arts, the king of running franchises into the ground, is responsible for breathing some fresh air into the extreme sports genre and quite possibly dethroning Tony Hawk as the king of the Skate genre. The one aspect that sets Skate apart from the Tony Hawk series is its control. All tricks are handled via the right analog stick with grabs assigned to the shoulder buttons. While some may scoff at this merely thinking its EA’s continued infatuation with having all their titles utilize the right analog stick, it is probably the closest you’ll get to real skating in a videogame. By flicking the right stick down and then popping it back up again the player will perform an Ollie, and doing a downward arc to the left or right will result in a pop-shuvit. This control scheme makes the game feel more natural and will make the player feel like their actually skating compared to doing a trick that requires you to hold down L1+X+Square. The controls in Skate definitely will take some getting used to but once you nail them you’ll feel instant satisfaction partly because Skate is somewhat of a hard title. Compared to the now arcade style Tony Hawk series Skate has been built as a simulation of skating and it shows. The game is all about finding the perfect line and stringing tricks together instead of trying to get a 250,000 point combo. Tony Hawk veterans may find a hard time adjusting to the title since you can’t go around and button smash with the hope landing tricks due to the sim nature of the game. The right analog trick control works well but at times you need to be very clear in what motions you make with it otherwise you won’t do a proper trick or end up bailing. This can be frustrating in the beginning but once you get the grip of the controls and the flow of the game you’ll be pulling off nollie 540s with no problem. Perhaps the second best part of Skate is the skating playground of San Vanelona. San Van is of course a fictional city but is based upon San Francisco, Vancouver and Barcelona. The city feels like a living world with people walking the streets, other skaters skating around and traffic on the streets. The city is also quite big with there being unique sections such as The Burbs, Downtown and Oldtown. Unlike the Tony Hawk games the entire world of San Vanelona is open from the start of the game except for special skate parks and compounds. Each part of the city has a unique style and you can clearly see the influence the developers had from the real world cities upon which they’re based off of. But perhaps the best part of the city is how it’s set up for skating. Unlike Tony Hawk not everything in San Van is made out of ramps and rails. So don’t expect a conveniently placed ramp and rail on every corner which perfectly sets up another trick opportunity. Instead in Skate you need to find the best line to pull of tricks and use the environment to your advantage. This is both challenging but fun at the same time since it represents real skating. Throughout the city are various skate parks consisting of large scale ones with multiple rails and ramps to old school ones consisting of just a pool. These skate parks are good places to test out your tricks and some of the game’s competitions take place at these locations too. Skate doesn’t offer a level editor but with the playground of San Vanelona you won’t need one.For the most part Skate is an enjoyable title but there are a few issues. The first and probably most commented one is the camera. In Skate the camera lies low behind the player as to simulate the look found in some skate videos. While this is a nice touch it does get in the way in terms of game play. The camera at times makes it difficult to know where the end of a ledge is if you need to jump a gap and it also makes avoiding civilians, who are absolutely stupid in terms of their “I’m not getting out of the way” A.I. Skate can also seem a bit slow at times. It takes a couple of tricks to gain some speed if you’re in a pool or a particular ramp set-up. But once again this follows the simulation style that Skate is thriving for. So you could either give credit to the developers to sticking with their guns by making the speed of the game seem slow at times, which mirrors real skating or you could look at this as being excessive since games are supposed to be fun. Skate also takes a long time to get used to. Pulling off different tricks will take you awhile since you need to be precise about your analog stick movements and you need to have perfect timing to successfully grind a rail. At times the precise analog movements take awhile from Skate. Yes, the overall idea of using the right analog stick is good and adds a lot to the game but you’ll probably find yourself pulling off the same tricks for the first half of the game or until you get used to things more. Unlike the past few Tony Hawk games you can’t get off of your board. While this doesn’t hurt the game it does make a feel a bit more constraining since there are times when you’ll be aching to just get off your board to walk up some stairs. The lack of a walk mode is clearly something that will make its way into the next iteration of Skate or perhaps even as a download in the future.Following in the path of the Tony Hawk series and other sports titles you can make your own skater. Skate uses the same customization engine as the other EA titles which aren’t as deep as one may want. However there are a good selection of clothing from brands like DC, Adidas and Alienware as well as a wide selection of boards, trucks and wheels to add that personal touch to your skateboard. As you build up your rep as a skater you’ll be able to join several competitions to boost your rep and to open more competitions. These range from playing a simple game of S.K.A.T.E, entering a trick competition or passing a video/photo challenge. During the game you’ll face challenges by pros like Paul Rodriguez, Jason Dill and Rob Dydrek. In the beginning these challenges are pretty simple and at times serve as a tutorial. But as you progress you’ll face more difficult challenges, some of which border on the insane side. Passing challenges also unlock new skate parks with the ultimate goal being to get to Danny Way’s skate park compound. Once you beat these pro challenges you’ll able to play as the pro’s in the free skate mode. Also when you beat certain challenges you earn more rep which results in sponsorships and getting on magazine covers. It would’ve been nice if there was a bit more of a deeper system in terms of the sponsors you have and the whole magazine cover aspect but for a first attempt EA did a solid job. There’s also a nice challenge called “Own the Spot” in which you need to beat a score on a certain environmental area. An example of this is pulling off a long grind on a stair case which leads to the street or reaching 600 points in a pool. The one thing about these challenges is that they aren’t listed on the map and only appear when you skate by them. This was a nice game design decision since it in a way encourages the player to explore San Van to find all 20 spots.Technically Skate is a solid title. The art design of San Vanelona is nice, the modeling of the various pro skaters and civilians are good and the overall look of the game is probably the best EA has produced this gen so far. Sadly there are quite a few moments of frame rate drops and pop-up. The small occasions of pop-up aren’t that bad or noticeable but the frame rate drops are quite frequent and at times are unexplainable*. Typically a game suffers frame drops when there is a lot happening at once (see Lair as an example of this) but with Skate it’ll happen when you’re pulling off tricks in a skate pool. The frame drops never really hurt the experience you have with the game but it just may bug you as to why this is happening on a powerhouse console like the PS3.Skate also has a pretty deep online experience which spans beyond the standard multiplayer fare. Skate has options to join ranked or unranked matches so you can meet up with some friends if you want. There are also online leader boards to see who the top skater is. But the core of Skate’s online mode is the Skate Reel. In this players can edit videos of them from the single-player mode and put them online. You can watch these user videos directly from the game or from the Skate website. And if you were impressed with someone’s skill in a particular video you can even rate videos. This aspect of the game is really fun since you can see the skill level of other people and it fits the skating culture of producing skate videos.As always EA brings a nice selection of bands for the soundtrack. You can expect bands like Nirvana, Black Flag and more during your Skate experience. You can of course edit your play list if you grow tired of hearing Nirvana for the 10th time, but who would ever grow tired of Nirvana? The one problem with the audio in Skate is that your skater is a mute. So during the small cutscenes in the game in which you meet a fellow Pro Skater or enter a tournament you can expect the GTA 3 treatment from your skater. Instead you have a fellow skater who “follows” you and serves as your cinematographer. So while you’re skating and pull off a slick move or bail out you can expect some comments from him instead of hearing yourself say something. This trend of not having a voice option for created characters has been in quite a few EA games and really doesn’t make sense. Why not have a few selections of voices for the player to choose to further add that personal touch? Aside from the lack of voice acting for your character the acting provided for the secondary characters and the pro skaters are quite good and feel natural.So does Skate dethrone Tony Hawk? I would say yes. While there are some minor issues with the game Skate presents a more realistic view of skating and in a way pays more respect to skating than the recent Tony Hawk games have. Skate feels fresh both in the control and the layout of San Vanelona. Hopefully EA will address the minor issues as Skate will become the premier skating game for extreme sports fans.*there are also frame rate drops in the 360 version of the game ',\n",

       "  'description': 'Remember the good ol’ SNES days, when Super Mario Kart was released? For those who remember these times, wasn’t the game addictively fun? Well, nearly fifteen years later, the same can be said for the latest iteration of the Mario Kart series on the Nintendo DS.  From the gameplay aspect, it all feels very polished in Mario Kart DS. If you’re familiar with the series or even a complete newbie, there’s nothing to be skeptical about. Mario Kart games have always offered an easygoing pick up and play experience, and this time it’s really no different. However as you progress through the several kart classes, races noticeably become more challenging. A fairly new gameplay mechanic in Mario Kart DS is power-sliding. This is performed with the L and R buttons on the DS and a turbo boost can come as a result when simultaneously pressing left and right on the D-pad. Some players may become confused on how to do this, but it’ll become second nature to pull of fairly quickly. An improved map also provides as a helpful tool, while making a simple but effective use of the touch-screen. You can switch between two map views on the fly, a zoomed out version, showing the entire track and what racer is in what position, then a zoomed in perspective, giving you a more vivid idea of how far you are in front or behind.  Another huge aspect of Mario Kart’s gameplay has always been the items. Bananas, Koopa shells, bomb-oms, stars, and item stealing Boos all make a return. Several new items include Bloopers, the squid-like foes in most Mario games, whom blast an area of dripping ink on the screen, slightly hindering the vision of other racers. Additionally, you can transform your racer into a Bullet Bill, and make your way to the front of the pack at near hyper-speed. All the items are pretty fun to utilize and help the player in their own unique way. However, I did find myself sometimes getting the same items repetitively using most characters, and that kind of got annoying after a while. Races consist of up to eight participants. In the grand prix mode, there are three classes, 50CC, 100CC, and 150CC. Inside each class exists 8 cups with four races in each. Now that alone adds a strong bit of variety in the game’s value. In fact, variety is the strongest attribute of Mario Kart DS. Time trials and a battle mode serve as good add-ons, but the one game mode that stands out greatly and makes this version of Mario Kart a classic is the mission mode! It spans over six levels and you’ll complete challenges like: driving backwards through a number of gates in order with an allotted time of forty-five seconds. Progressing through these small missions leads up to an unlockable boss fight on each level.  While much is served on the single-player side, the greatest thing about Mario Kart DS is the multiplayer. Without question, this entry in the series delivers the best multiplayer action in any Mario Kart game to date. All game modes can be used in the multiplayer component. With the Nintendo Wifi capability, take your kart online with folks from around the world. You can even connect to players wirelessly within thirty feet of you, and them having a copy of Mario Kart DS isn’t even required. They can simply download a mirrored version of the game. The multiplayer is widely and easily accessible which extends the game’s overall value.  Mario Kart DS contains a pretty decent presentation. Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach and the rest of the gang are all here, with a few unlockable characters. The graphics are in 3D and look pretty much exactly like the N64 Mario Kart. What’s great is that most of the tracks are a collection of the best and most memorable ones from previous entries in the series. The sound isn’t too shabby; in a nutshell it’s all the sound effects and music from the Mario universe recycled.  In summation, Mario Kart DS is clearly the best Mario Kart game out. With a solid presentation, traditionally good gameplay that is significantly improved on, the load of extra content and game modes, and some of the best multiplayer around, it’s a must own for those with a DS. In essence, it maintains and at the same time expands on what made the original Super Mario Kart a classic back in 1992. Addictive and great fun!',\n",

       "  'description': 'Bubble Bobble Old and New for the GBA is an excellent adaptation of the original arcade game, and superior to the popular NES version. I\\'m not\\xa0sure if this game was released in North America, as I am reviewing the Japanese version. Even so, this is an extremely import friendly game. Only the game menus are in Japanese (Katakana) and are very self explanitory. You don\\'t need any knowledge of Japanese in enjoy the game, as all of the in game text is written in English.As the name suggests, there are two versions on this cart...old and new. The old version is the arcade classic. The graphics are spot on, and the music comes close to the quality of the arcade original. The new version is the same game with a 16-bit quality update to the graphics and the music. Both versions play exactly the same. It should be noted though, that in the original \"old\" version, you only get one \"credit\" to go through the entire game. In the \"new\" version, the are quite a few continues available. While the two versions\\xa0share the same tremendously enjoyable gameplay, they also share a few minor problems.To anyone who enjoyed playing any previous version, the hardest aspect to adjust to is the fact that the entire playing feild is not visible all at once. The default setting of the game is \"zoomed in\" and you can see a fair amount of the playing feild but not all of it. This can make for some very annoying deaths with enemies dropping in from above, or flying up from below outside your field of vision. While this can be rectified with the simple press of the \"R\" button to view the entire playing field, the games graphical quality takes a tremendous hit when zoomed out in this way. Since the GBA\\'s screen is wider than that of the arcade original, when zoomed out the image is centered on the GBA\\'s screen. On the GBA\\'s small screen, this can be a little taxing on the eyes. A Gameboy Player is the best way to play this game if you have one available. The DS, DS Lite\\xa0and the Gameboy Advance SP also provide a comfortable playing experience. The original Gameboy Advance and the Gameboy Micro are not the best way to play this game.What you really need to ask yourself is...how badly do you want a portable version of Bubble Bobble? The game is also available on the NES and PS1, not to mention the Wii\\'s virtual console. If you really want to take Bubble Bobble with you on the road, this version is a good one. The screen dimensions just may take some getting used to.',\n",

       "  'description': ' It has taken a couple of iterations by Infinity Ward and Treyarch; but this time Infinity Ward finally got the hit. After several weeks of the Beta back in August and September, Call of Duty 4 has finally come, and for the most part, has stayed in many consoles. The ever-so popular World War II franchise has shifted away from that setting, into a Modern setting. It proves to be a fresh, new, and exciting setting to play in. A good, yet short, single player prepares you for the oh-so addicting and fantastic multiplayer experience, that continues to bring gamers back to the game.  The first thing you will notice about Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is probably the fact it is what it says: Modern Warfare. The trend of World War II games finally stopped, at least, for one game, and now you get to play the very good Call of Duty formula in a Modern setting. The first mission you play in single player introduces you to several major events going on. You begin the game as Sergeant \"Soap\" MacTavish, and you immediately begin by learning how to fire your weapons. Once you pass this training mission, you are introduced to your Captain...Captain Price, who is alongside pretty much throughout the game. The first time you truly get to shoot somebody is in the , where you infiltrate a cargo ship and try to extract some evidence that proves there is a nuclear device onboard.  Throughout the whole game you are introduced to your enemy: Russian ultranationalists and their leader Imran Zakhaev, who is rebelling against his government and seizing nuclear weapons. The whole time you attempt to try and track down this man, and try and stop him from launching nuclear weapons, that would subsequently, begin another World War.  You are also introduced to another character, Sergeant Paul Jackson of the Marine Corps. You will normally alternate between characters for a brief period, and at times will have missions where both the characters from Soap\\'s team and \\'s team will be involved. While you play as Sgt. Jackson, you are searching for another Russian ultranationalist; Khaled Al-Asad.  One of the biggest gripes about the single player is the fact that it gets repetitive. Most of the missions require you to go to Point A to Point B, and at times you feel like you are just doing the same thing, just packaged differently. This is true for the most part, however, in one mission in an AC-130 gunship. Variety like this makes the single player worth going through, but for the most part, it will get quite repetitive.  With that being said, Call of Duty 4 is a very good looking game overall. The guns, the characters, all animate very well. Buildings look good, explosions, all look the way they should, and packages well into the game. It is certainly not the best looking game out there, but it is far from average. With that being said, it also sounds very well. Your guns all sound the way they should, and the explosions are extremely realistic, you will hear the sounds of the enemy barking out orders, and will be up to you to react to them the best you can.  Continuing on with the single player, it can be quite difficult at times. When you play on the hardest setting, Veteran, you will want to pummel your head into your wall, because at times it is simply impossible, especially the ultra-hard Epilogue: Mile High Club. When you finally get the achievement on the Veteran setting, you will feel like you are best video gamer alive. With that being said, the sheer difficulty is one I don\\'t recommend.  Call of Duty 4 also controls very good. Your grenades are mapped to your bumpers, and to aim you pull back the left trigger, and to shoot, you pull back the right trigger. You have the ability to run, to sprint away from people, or to get into cover, to get the perfect shot to cripple your enemy. The ability to knife people is also satisfying, as it is a one hit kill. As you take damage, your screen will begin to flash red, similar to Gears of War, you need to get out of the action for a few seconds for it to recover, while it does not sound very realistic, it is a pretty good mechanic overall. The single player campaign will run you probably 5-6 hours at the very most on the  difficulty, but even more on the Veteran difficulty.  With the quite disappointing single player, opens up the multiplayer. And boy, it delivers it. You have the ability to customize (to an extent), your weapons, and \"perks\" you have. Perks are basically power ups that can range from more ammo to more health; you acquire these perks by leveling up. You also acquire weapons by leveling up. You can acquire scopes, but they acquire certain goals to be met, which can get surprisingly hard.  You level up by winning matches, killing people, and a whole sort of other things. All of these points accumulate to your level, and the higher you are, the more things open up to you. At a certain level, you can join or create a clan. Even though it is a very basic, it gives you a sense of being more different, and less common. You go through levels 1-55, and then you gain access to the \"Prestige Mode.\" This strips you of all your weapons you unlocked, and perks, but you keep your stats and XP. You get a new icon and you start all over again. You can do this several times.  There are several modes in multiplayer. One is being Team Deathmatch, which is pretty much what it says. Another is Search and Destroy, where you are either defending a specific location or you have a bomb, and need to detonate that location with the bomb. If the bomb is armed, the defending team needs to disarm it, or they will lose the round. There are several modes that either branch off of this, or are branched off the other modes.  Some other ones are considered \"Hardcore\", which basically means you are stripped off certain things, making it a bit harder to play, but also more challenging, and fun. While playing in a match, you have certain abilities when you hit certain kill streaks. 3 kills in a row is activating a UAV, which gives a location on all of your enemies. 5 kills in a row activates an air strike, hopefully crippling your enemies and adding some kills. 7 kills in a row is a helicopter, which can only be stopped by a rocket launcher.  With all of this being said, there are some gripes with the multiplayer. At times, you may be spawned during a firefight, and will probably end up dying right when you spawn. This also happens when you will spawn right in front of an enemy or behind them, which provides an unfair advantage. At times you will probably be trying to figure out why the fuck this actually happens. This problem springs up almost every match, and it seems like you cannot get around it. Also, the obvious campers and other people are always there, always using such tactics that will probably make you scream into your TV.  Overall, Call of Duty 4 is a very good game. A great multiplayer manages to help out the short and disappointing single player. You will probably spend most of your time on the multiplayer portion; however, going back and playing the single player on the Veteran difficulty could be even more challenging and rewarding than playing the multiplayer portion. At the end of the day, you probably will not be surprised when you have Call of Duty 4 in your console, day in, and day out. The phenomenal multiplayer will have you coming back to level up, and try and get as high as you can in the prestige mode, and trying to unlock each challenge you can. Call of Duty 4 is a solid game all around.',\n",

       " {'deck': 'Lair is a solid concept but lacks proper execution',\n",
       "  'description': 'With the reveal of a bevy of PS3 titles in 2005 one that caught the attention of Playstation gamers was Factor 5’s Lair. Not only were gamers interested in the title because it featured dragons, which are truly awesome, but because of Factor 5’s pedigree as a game developer. With titles such as the Star War Rogue Squadron under their belt and with the technical know-how which produced amazing visuals on the Nintendo GameCube, the anticipation for Lair was quite high. Sadly the end result is quite disappointing and is the first 1st party PS3 game to be a bomb.First off let’s talk about the good things in Lair, one of which is the story. Lair takes place in a mythical land ruled by two nations, the Asylians who reside in the lush mountain green lands, and the volcano based Mokia. The two groups broke apart due to the emergence of volcanoes which disrupted the land and the Mokai resent the Asylians for the resources they have. While the story for Lair is not as deep as MGS or Zelda, it is pretty interesting and the world that Factor 5 is pretty original. Some of the characters may be a bit cliché but it doesn’t get to the point where it takes away from the overall story. There are also quite a few big revelations the main character Rohn encounters throughout the game which makes him change his views on how the Mokai are treated.It’s a real pity that some game players may not be able to see Lair’s story due to the unresponsive and clunky controls. In case you didn’t know Lair is the first PS3 title to be built around the Sixaxis controller from the start. While other titles that use Sixaxis allow the users the option of using the analog controls, Lair does not allow analog control for flight but it is used for ground combat. While some may say that the Sixaxis control for Lair may take awhile to get used to the end result is that despite being accustomed to it for several levels it is still clunky and makes certain actions in the game more of a chore than a fun experience. Doing a 180 move is a bit difficult to pull off and shaking the controller up and down to kill an enemy or destroy an object just feels a bit off and tedious after awhile. Another problem with the game’s controls is the speed of the dragon. While of course the speed of a dragon shouldn’t be as fast as a fighter jet, but the speed of the dragon is so slow that turning around to reorient yourself can be quite an issue and just takes longer than it should. The controls also feel a bit unresponsive in certain areas, especially during the first boss battle where you need to move the controller left and right to avoid Sea Serpents venom. It’s very clear that Factor 5 didn’t refine the Sixaxis control as much as they could have since the end experience with the controls in the game is one of frustration and anger over what could’ve been a fun experience.Let’s move on to a better part of the game, the visuals. Since its debut Lair has been touted as being built around 1080P, a feature many gamers like me do not have. The visuals of Lair are quite excellent in some areas such as seeing a massive bridge filled with thousands of soldiers and with dragons flying in the sky. But the two problems with the visuals in Lair are that they’re a bit uneven at times and the color palette that’s used in the game takes away from the experience. First off the frame rate in the game is incredibly unstable which results in a ton of slowdown during hectic battles and animation that looks incredibly choppy. It also doesn’t help the ground combat almost feels broken. At one time the enemy ground soldiers did absolutely nothing while I stood still but then proceeded to move in what seemed to be a 5 animation frame set. It’s unknown if the disappointing ground combat is the result of some type of tech issue or poor game design, which is a problem throughout the game. The other problem with the visuals is the overall art direction and the use of colors. Expect a lot of browns, dark greens and other earthy colors when playing. The main problem with the use of these colors is that it makes seeing which dragons you’re supposed to attack a bit difficult. The only way you know which dragon is an enemy is based on the color of their fire. So for example the Ice Dragons have a light blue fire color. But during the hectic combat levels it is still tricky finding the enemy dragons which could result in some frustrating battles. It would’ve helped a lot if there was some sort of on-screen map which would make it easier to find the enemy dragons.The one aspect that is the best in Lair is the audio. Featuring a score composed by John Debney (The Passion of the Christ, Sin City) Lair features a fully orchestral score that is probably one of the best to be heard this year. The tracks are lush and fit the tone of the game perfectly. It’s nice that you can listen to the tracks through the extra content that’s in the game since many gamers probably won’t play the full length of Lair. Aside from the music Lair also has some pretty good voice acting. The core of it is pretty good but a few of the performers feel off due to them not fitting their characters and their overall performance not being as good as some of the others.While the controls in Lair are just crap the overall production values are pretty good. Despite some of its technical issues Lair doesn’t feel like a cheap game, which just further adds to the frustration over why the controls are crap. You can see the Factor 5 put a lot of time and effort into the game and it shows. An interesting feature in the game is the mission select screen which shows Rohn atop his dragon looking over a world map while a narrator explains the following mission and the overall impact it has on the story. Touches like this are nice and can make you appreciate the game for the few things it does well.With its pedigree in making arcade flight titles many were wondering what the missions of Lair would be like since Factor 5 had more freedom over what they could do. Sadly the core game design mirrors Factor 5’s previous efforts as Lair features very basic mission design that at times feel old. Many of the missions in the game consist of escorting a group of boats or creatures and to protect them from the oncoming Mokai. There are some interesting missions such as one where you need to avoid searchlights but this mission can be quite difficult due to the poor controls. It’s also a problem to find your objective/enemy in the game. While most of the time you do know what you have to do going about it can be a problem. Once again this is due to the poor control which makes some objectives hard to accomplish and the poor art design which makes it hard to see some foes.Lair in concept is a solid title that could’ve spawned a series of titles but sadly the poor controls and tech issues take away from the game to the point where it’s almost unplayable since you’ll hardly find yourself having any fun. While some titles that have had tech issues have come back to rectify themselves in better sequels this will most likely not be the case with Lair due to the stigma the game has garnered amongst gamers. When you have a budget of over $20 million and spend almost 3 years in development it’s almost inexcusable for this to be the final result. Factor 5 should be applauded in some respects due to what they were able to accomplish such as developing a solid graphics engine but it seems like they tried to do too much especially considering this was their first next-gen title and their first time working with the PS3 and Playstation architecture. Perhaps Factor 5 can redeem themselves with their PSN title but that’s if Sony hasn’t cancelled their contract with Factor 5 over the disappointment that is Lair. ',\n",

       "  'description': 'Despite its looks, Professor Layton and the Curious Village is far from being a game just for kids. Developed by Level-5, the studio behind Dragon Quest VIII and Dark Cloud, it combines two brain twisting genres into an unique title on the Nintendo DS.   The story begins when Professor Layton, a puzzle fanatic and part time detective, and his side kick, Luke, receive a message from Lady Dhalia, a rich widow in search of a lost valuable memento left by her late husband, called the Golden Apple. Before even setting foot in St. Mystérie, the tone of the game reveals itself, throwing a puzzle the player\\'s way in order to discover the actual location of the village. Along the way to solve the Golden Apple and the many other mysteries found in St. Mystérie, the villagers present brainteasers that sometimes lead to clues when solved. Upon exploration of the environment, more puzzles can be discovered, amassing to around 150 puzzles total. However, only a fraction of these has to be solved in order to complete the game\\'s story.   The puzzles themselves range from all kinds of problems, mixing mathematically heavy enigmas, simple jigsaw puzzles and even Tetris-like block pushers. For each of these, a certain amount of piccarats, the game\\'s currency, is awarded. These are used to acquire the many bonuses locked up in the bonus menu found outside the story mode, and range from a variety of puzzles. There is no time limit to solving the problems presented, but for each wrong answer, a certain amount of piccarats is taken away. However, they are never completely zeroed out, stopping at a certain minimum number available to earn. Tips can also be used at the cost of hint coins, which can be found through good, old fashioned, pixel hunting of the village\\'s backgrounds, in the form of stylus tapping. Even though there are lots of possibilities to get help, the puzzles are no push overs, and often provide interesting challenges that require an \"outside the box\" method of thinking. These were created with the help of Chiba University\\'s Professor Akira Tago, which is a known Japanese puzzle creator, author of many books in the subject.  Artistically, Professor Layton and the Curious Village has high production values. The visual style is influenced by European art, with a color palette and character design that is clearly based on The Triplets of Belleville. No two characters look alike, all with their own spirit and personality brought by a simple, yet charismatic line of drawing. The story moves in the form of dialog bubbles with character stills similar to the Phoenix Wright games, but important elements are presented through fully animated cut scenes, with voice acting. The overall quality of the presentation is very, very high, which provides are great deal of the immersion, sharing space with the main objective of the game, that is, presenting increasingly challenging puzzles. Controls rely on the DS touch screen almost completely, and are precise up to a certain limit of the screen sensitivity space.  Professor Layton and the Curious Village will provide a drawn out experience to the casual DS player, with around ten hours in the main story mode, with even more challenges after its completion. Bonus sections open up after the story closes, and the puzzles that were missed during play through can be solved by going to a sort of puzzle house located in the village. Also, there are special puzzle rooms that can be unlocked by collecting pieces of furniture, a painting and a robotic creature, given by specific puzzles found in St. Mystérie. More puzzles also be obtained through the DS\\' wireless connection, as weekly additions make their way to your personal collection. The occasionally head scratching and random pixel hunt might turn some more impatient players away, but for those looking for an intelligent and unique adventure game for their DS, their is no need to look much further.   Just knock on the Professor\\'s door.   \\t\\t',\n",

It dosent really matter which console you get this game on, its greatMy rating scale depends on the platform and genre its on. Since PC has much more awesome games on it, i mark much harder on it so a 80% on PC would mean its great compared to the hundreds of other awesome PC games of that genre, and might be better than a 98% of consoles. A great game is a great game, on the system. I like to keepy my reviews short and sweet, so i wont bore you and get to the point.

       " {'deck': 'God of War 2 is one of the most epic games to appear on the PS2',\n",
       "  'description': 'The End Begins. That’s the tag line for God of War 2, the follow up to the critically acclaimed God of War. While it may not be the end for the God of War series, it is the end for the Playstation 2. It’s fitting that the best console for the past 6 years ends it lifecycle with one of the best games to be released on it.God of War 2 picks up with Kratos as the new God of War. While he exacted his revenge upon Ares he is not content with sitting on his throne idly. So in typical Kratos fashion he has his army of Spartan soldiers destroying cities in his name. Unfornately this doesn’t please the other Gods but Kratos doesn’t give a damn.As Kratos flies down to the Island of Rhodes he is stripped of his powers by his once benefactor Athena. This won’t stop Kratos though as he continues on his rampage up to an event with Zeus which sends him to Hades. There Kratos learns from the Titan Gaia that he can change his encounter with Zeus by visiting the 3 Sisters of Fate. With the backing of the Titans, Kratos goes on a journey to find the sisters and change his fate. That’s the core story of God of War 2 which is simply one of the most epic and fun titles to appear on the PS2.The core of GOW2 is the same as GOW1; you go around various locales and dispatch enemies with your chain blades. But now that the Gods have taken your powers away you need to re-level your skills and acquire new magic. Some of the new weapons you get from the game come from boss encounters such as Typhon’s Bane, the Barbarian King’s Hammer, Euryale’s Gaze and Rage of the Titans. One of the most interesting new powers is one that allows Kratos to slow down time. This power can be used both to solve puzzles and during combat but only in the presence of certain statues. These new weapons and abilities are similar to some in the previous game but are still fun to use and feel fresh. Of course there are some new moves you can do with the Blades of Athena, many of which are context sensitive moves against enemies. Besides having to acquire new weapons and magic, Kratos can now swing on objects using his chain blades as well as having new wall climb mechanics. The swing mechanics in the game are cool but the areas in which you get to use this ability are a bit too few in between and are actually involved in one of the games most frustrating puzzles.One of the best things about GOW 2 is its integration of Greek Mythology in the game. Besides the game’s first boss being the mythical statue at the city of Rhodes, you will encounter Prometheus, Theseus, Perseus, and Atlas and even ride Pegasus for a few levels. This makes the games world feel a lot richer since it in a way further integrates Kratos into Greek mythology. It’s also interesting to see how characters like Theseus and Perseus are portrayed in the God of War universe and it’s fitting that these characters have some of the most brutal deaths in the game.The only thing game players had an issue with in God of War 1 was the small amount of boss battles. While the three battles in the game were amazing they were too far from each other and they always left you wanting more. Thankfully GOW2 fixed this with around 7 boss battles. GOW2 doesn’t hold back in the intensity and over the topness of the battles as you will face off against the Colossus of Rhodes in the opening battle and eventually defeat it by going inside of the statue. You then face off against Theseus, The Barbarian King, Perseus, Medusa’s sister and eventually the Sisters of Fate. Just like the GOW these boss battles have that intense cinematic feel and require different skills to take them out. The Statue battle in the first level easily outshines the Hydra battle and the face-off against the Barbarian King, while short, was worth the wait. Thankfully there isn’t a weak spot in any of the boss battles as they don’t feel forced into the game just for the sake of having them.While God of War wasn’t a Tomb Raider style game when it came to puzzles, God of War continues this trend of having interesting puzzles that never become frustrating. There are still your standard block and pressure plate puzzles as well as some new ones that require Kratos to slow down time to continue. The difficulty of the puzzles never gets to a point of anger due to you not passing them. Usually you may not get it on the first try but then suddenly realize your error and then pass it on the second go. There is some platforming in GOW2 some of which is good while some is annoying. Having to rotate a circular platform which resets itself when you fight enemies can be annoying but not frustrating and having to swing jump columns one of which slowly resets itself in the ground and the last of which is blocked by a wall can take a few try to pass but once again it doesn’t reach that awful spinning blades of hell found in the Hades level in God of War.God of War was a visual showpiece on the PS2 and GOW2 continues this. The art design retains that feel that made the first title so good as well as expanding it. When you see the steeds of time and their immense size you’re simply be blown away as you would’ve thought something of this grand size was only possible on the PS3. All the visuals have been refined so they of course look sharper than GOW and improved so there are more enemies and action happening at the same time. When you see yourself fighting 5 soldiers when you have a giant Colossus and there’s no slow down your jaw will be on the floor. God of War 2 is easily the most impressive PS2 game ever, even surpassing MGS3, Zone of the Enders 2 and even Shadow of the Colossus. It’s also impressive how the developers have gone about setting the stages for these battles and epic levels. One of the most impressive battles in the game has you fighting a mysterious foe in the shadows against the backdrop of a massive window. The really interesting thing about this battle is that both Kratos and his enemy are in silhouette and the camera is on a 2D view so the battle almost looks like something out of a Frank Miller novel.Once again God of War easily has one of the best game scores ever to appear in a game. The score surpasses God of War through its more intricate compositions and hard hitting themes. The score is similar to one of a Basil Poledouris (Robocop, Starship Troopers) or Ennio Morricone (The Untouchables). From the front end music to the opening track for the Island of Rhodes, the score in God of War 2 is one of the most immersive and entertaining score to appear in a games for quite some time. It really makes you want to fight harder and keep on going since it’s that good. The excellent voice acting also returns with T.C Carson reprising his role as Kratos and Linda Hunt returning as the narrator whose role is revealed in the game. There are also a few celeb voice actors with Michael Clarke Duncan (The Green Mile, Daredevil) voices the mighty Atlas while Harry Hamlin reprises his role of Perseus who he played in the classic film Clash of the Titans.At the end of the day God of War 2 is a worthy follow up to one of the best PS2 games ever and easily surpasses it. It takes everything the last game did and takes it to the max while still looking good visually and playing without any big frame rate drops. It’s good that the PS2 ends its life with a game that will surely keep those waiting for a PS3 busy. God of War 2 ',\n",

       "  'description': \"Okami is a game developed by the late Clover Studios. Clover Studios are a development studio funded by Capcom. Some of their most famous titles include Viewtiful Joe and the upcoming God Hand. Okami is one of the last must have UK Playstation 2 titles to come before the dawning of the Playstation 3. The game follows the journey of the sun goddess Amaterasu on her quest to vanquish the evil that has plagued the beautiful land of Nippon. On this quest you will encounter a vast amount of memorable characters and help them on their own personal journeys like any good protagonist should.  When the game starts you are introduced to the world with a little back story. Basically 100 years ago there was a white wolf, that with the help of the hero Nagi, vanquished a demon named Orochi and sealed him with Nagi’s sword. The adventure begins with the sword being removed and the world is thrown into turmoil. You are Amaterasu, the sun god and the white wolf that helped save Nippon 100 years ago, reborn but considerably weakened. The game is very similar to the Legend of Zelda games for a number of reasons. Amaterasu, much like Link doesn’t say a word, so to help the flow of the game and the story, Amaterasu is given a companion to do the talking for her. This character is a little tom thumb like character named Issun, who sits on the end of Amaterasu’s nose for the most part of the journey. Issun offers advice and talks to the game's various characters, much like Midna recently did for Link. Issun is a wandering artist, who joins Amaterasu because he wants to learn about the gods and their powers. Amaterasu and Issun set out to fix the world and destroy the evil that has been released.  Okami does offer one major gameplay innovation that will be the main driving force of the whole game; the celestial brush. The celestial brush basically works by stopping time and allowing the player to draw certain symbols, for example, drawing a line through an enemy or a tree would perform a cutting move. There are 13 brush styles and some have numerous uses. It all works wonderfully; you might think all the time stopping would detract from the fluidity of the game, but it doesn’t at all. The brush is used in a number of clever ways like drawing bombs and dropping them on monsters, exposing rooms behind cracked walls, and pretty much anything that you feel needs blowing up. The majority of the brush powers are used for dragging certain elements into contact with other elements, for example, if there is a wall of ice in front of you, you will need to 'drag' a flame over to it by drawing a line connecting the two. The brush is best used in 'interactive' cut scenes, but I'll explain that more later on. When the brush works it really is a fantastic gameplay element, but on the occasion it can be difficult to get the shapes spot on, and more importantly an angle to see the object you wish to manipulate, but for the majority it’s incredible.  The celestial brush isn’t the only gameplay element that the game offers. Like I said before, the game plays a lot like the Legend of Zelda games, but Okami seems to take their formula and improve on it in a number of ways. Like Zelda you are set in a massive world, and also similar to Zelda, you will only see about 85% of the world in the main game, due to the massive amount of side quests and secrets the game offers. The money in the game is put to good use as well. You can buy a whole range of useful items that can give you things like; infinite ink for a short time, increased defence for a short time, increased attack for a short time, etc. The game also supplies a range of weapons for you to use. The weapons are split into 3 categories. Firstly there are reflectors. You start out with a reflector, and as weapons go, they are a good all-rounder. Secondly you can get rosary beads, which are like a kind of whip, which are fast with a good range. Finally you can acquire swords. Swords act as your strong, slow weapon. The weapon system allows you to equip a weapon to main or sub. Main weapons fulfil the tasks I mentioned earlier, whereas sub weapons are used slightly differently to add some customisation to your character.  When running around the map, Amaterasu leaves behind a trail of flowers. This is a fantastic touch and it's appreciated when you have such a vast world to run across. The way Amaterasu jumps can be a little annoying especially when you approach a ledge of some description, as to prevent you from falling, the game will stop you as you reach the ledge. However, if you do want to jump off you still get stopped and just kind of awkwardly fall down. The interactive cutscenes I mentioned earlier are also a great element of the game. Throughout the game your task is mostly to help people, but because most people won’t see you as a god, they don’t always know it's you who is helping them. Therefore during certain parts of the game, your 'divine intervention' is needed and this comes in the form of interactive cutscenes. A character will be doing something and you will need to use your celestial brush to intervene.  The game's visuals are amongst the PS2's most impressive. The game uses a cell shading style very similar to the one Clover Studios used in the Viewtiful Joe games. However, Okami looks more hand drawn, which fits perfectly with the games artistic theme. When looking at the screenshots it's hard to imagine the game running smoothly, especially on the PS2 hardware. But the game runs without fault and for the most part, looks better than some of the Xbox 360 games. During the game you have to purify areas polluted with evil by cleansing them with your celestial brush or by defeating monsters in the area. Once this is done you are truly treated with a cutscene where the evil is almost washed away by a sea of flowers, and it looks absolutely amazing. The only flaw to be found is while during cutscenes, Amaterasu doesn’t sport your weapon of choice, but instead the default weapon that you start the game with. This isn’t really a problem but a point worth noting.  The sound is very traditional to Japan, and goes very well with most of the game's looks and theme. However, the talking 'noises' the characters make can get very annoying. There are certain characters that it sounds almost charming with, like Issun, Susano and Nagi, but mostly it's just irritating. The 'noises' sound like a mix between the voices on Chibi Robo and Animal Crossing. It's a shame because it’s really the only solid let down of an otherwise excellent game.  Before, I mentioned the vast amount of side quests the game contains, but as well as side quests there is a wealth of other non linear content. There are a number of mini-games, for example there is a game where you are supposed to dig down into the ground to find water to fill a hot spring, and during this you must lead a character down to search for the right spot. There are numerous other mini-games, ranging from chasing down thieves to digging up turnips. The list could go on. There are also a number of features to unlock by completing the game.  The story and characters are the game's best feature, however, Issun, your travelling companion, becomes one of the most memorable characters in games to date. He has a number of humorous and risky one liners becoming the source of most of the game's humour. Generally all the characters are designed astoundingly well. The story goes on to surpass the initial task and makes for one of the longest games to be released in a while. The game took me about 48 hours to finish, and only really scraping the surface of the game's extra content in my first play. It also needs to be said that the game is very funny, and while the humour is present though most of the game, it doesn’t distract or take anything away from the severity of the truly epic story.  by James Considine, Group_C \\t\\t\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'Battlefeild: Bad Company single player review',\n",
       "  'description': '\\xa0I will just get this out of the way really quickBattlefeild bad company is the most unique and suprisingly good games to come out this year so far. I began this experiance during the multiplayer beta earlier this year and i was left feeling suprised , but not excited for the game. Later when the demo came out it was much more polished and the singleplayer got me hooked and i decided to purchase the game.The game\\'s singleplayer starts with you getting out of a helicopter reporting for duty after an apparent court martial of the main character , you are now assigned as punishment to B-company. Also known as \"bad company\" , this military unit is comprised of all the misfits and screw ups the army has to offer. You are quickly greated by a group of 3 guys that are clearly off the deep end and you join up with them as a 4 man squad. The squad leader Redford , is your typical roughneck army sergeant . Haggard is your typical crazy redneck. And sweetwater is the wisecracking smartass of the story. Some of the dialog these characters are given is pretty funny . So are some of the situations you are put in by these guys On the first mission you are sent in to take out some artillery guns up on a hill and it becomes very apparent from the first couple of tutorial parts of the mission that this game is very different. First and formost being the destruction that you can produce in the game. You can Blow huge chunks out of every building in the game , you can take down trees , and even explosives carve deep into the ground to create craters. Its easily the most entertaining part about this game and what makes it so unique. The other defining feature is how open and big the world is . Even in the first mission you can approach your objectives from almost any angle. This becomes more and more important in your strategy as you go along in the game , especially on the later levels. You are given colectables in the game such as gold crates and weapons that are scattered throughout the game world. Its pretty cool that they added another layer of replayability to the game with 2 types of collectables. Weapons you pick up in the game for the first time are added to your collectable list , some you will find on dead enemies , and some you will find hidden in the world. After you collect the weapon they dont really unlock any new features or ability to access them though. The other collectables are gold crates which are scattered across the world aswell and are a little bit tougher to find due to the incredible amounts of buildings and size of the world in bad company. Im not going to ruin some of the single player moments , but it has some great ones that are both funny and kick ass.If you havent heard yet , this game sports some of the most amazing Audio in a video game . The sound is clear and sharp , the explosions will shake your house , and the ambient noises of distant warfare is very memorable . Sounds change depending on the enviroment you are in . Inside of houses gunshots will echo and reverberate. And when you are outside they sound like actual guns being fired at a range( unlike alot of todays games ) The lighting in this game is pretty good too , there are some awesome moments in the game where your jaw will drop at the lighting technology implemented in this game. All the lighting is dynamic and light will fill up a house and cast shadows with every hole you put in it. Light will shine through trees and cast shadows on your gun and other things aswell. The special effects ( most importantly explosions ) are simply out of this world . With every artillery round that hits infront of you , you can see each individual patch of dirt fly up into the air . the aftermath of each explosion leaves thick smoke lingering in the area. Blowing holes in buildings looks amazing and you can see chunks of the wall blowing outwards from the building. Its truely a sight to see.There are a ton of weapons in the game that range military revolvers all the way to 50 caliber sniper rifles. The assault rifles in this game are the most usefull do to the fact that they are accurate and carry the most important tool in the game which is the grenade launcher. The sniper rifles can hit anything you can see all the way out to the edge of visibility. The shotguns are very powerful but only at extremely close range . The machine guns are not as accurate as the assault rifles but carry alot of ammo in a clip. And the sub machine guns are IMO not very good due to the fact you cannot zoom in and use the iron sights to get a head shot but they do have a very high rate of fire. There are also tools you get in the game such as an impact wrench that you can use to repair , and destroy vehicles. The GPS transmitter will call in mortar strikes where you need them and has a short rechage time. The C4 is used to destroy objectives and vehicles , but is also useful in gaining entry to buildings. And the laser designator is a pair of binoculors that you use to call in a missle to strike a enemy vehicle. There is also a rocket launcher ( but i think you know what that would do ) The vehicles in this game are alot of fun and are easy to handle. you can choose from a variety of types ranging from armored cars , Armored assault vehicles , Tanks , buggys , boats , and helicopters. Each vehicle has a first and third person veiw. When in first person it takes you inside the vehicle and you can also look around inside. Some of the vehicles have machine gun turrets and even grenade launcher turrets! You will need vehicles to get around the world unless you want to spend alot of time walking.Over all this game is the best i have played this year and worthy of a buy from anyone that is a fan of military shooters or just blowing stuff up ',\n",

       " {'deck': 'NBA Street Homecourt fails to capture the spirit of predecessors',\n",
       "  'description': 'One of the best arcade sports titles to come out in the past 10 years was NBA Street. The game had the perfect mix of pure arcade fun and basketball skill. It’s been nearly 3 years since the last NBA Street and now the series is making its PS3 debut with NBA Street Homecourt.With each addition in the franchise Street has become more mature. One could say that NBA Street 1 was a young child while NBA Street Homecourt is a young adult. Homecourt doesn’t feature the somewhat cartoony visuals or presentation that the other Streets did. Homecourt is a lot like NBA Street Vol. 3 in that the presentation is taken a bit more seriously. There’s no more annoying commentator and the Street narrator from Vol. 3 returns. Homecourt also has some more meaning behind it too. See in this version some of the key NBA players represented in the game have their real homecourts where they practiced their skills in the game. Some of the players such as Carmelo Anthony will actually narrate their homecourt level or discuss the importance it has to them. This is a nice touch to the series and takes the franchise into a good direction.Other than the mature feel of the game, Homecourt has also gotten a revamped control scheme. The first two titles had the shoulder buttons handle the tricks while Vol. 3 had the right analog stick handle the tricks. Homecourt now features a context sensitive trick system that take awhile to get used to. The triangle and square buttons now handle the tricks while L1 and R1 and trick modifiers. Depending and how long or how many times you press the triangle or square button your character will perform a different move such as a crossover. The trick system also takes into account the size of the player when it comes to tricks. So you can’t do the same tricks that Steve Nash can do if you’re playing as Shaq. Dunks have also gotten a revamp. When you go for a dunk holding down the circle button will charge up a meter. The longer you hold down the button the more points you get and if you time it well you can pull off a new double dunk. Double dunking consists of your player doing an insane move such as grabbing the ball with his feet after dunking to score another dunk. When you double dunk you obviously get 2 points instead of 1. This trick system does take awhile to get used to since you can’t really button smash your way to victory due to the new stealing A.I. Compared to other Street titles you could usually do a ton of tricks and not have to worry about your opponent stealing the ball but that changes with Homecourt. The A.I in the game will be all over you if you’re careless with your moves. Stealing is a bit easier too so if you do loose possession you have the chance to win the ball back quickly if you select the right player to make the steal attempt.One of the best aspects of the Street series is the Gamebreaker moves. Over the course of the franchise the Gamebreakers have evolved with more elaborate moves and visuals. Sadly the Gamebreakers in Homecourt are a bit disappointing. First of all the biggest problem with the new Gamebreakers is how you activate them. In the past titles you simply pressed L1+R1+Circle but in Homecourt when you’ve filled up your Gamebreaker meter you need to go to the half court and press triangle to activate it. This method of activation is a bit clumsy and disrupts the flow of the tricks you do. When it comes to the tricks themselves they’re also a bit disappointing. In the previous Streets all the Gamebreaker tricks were essentially the Uber tricks and couldn’t be done in normal play. But in Homecourt all the tricks you’re capable of are basically the same as your regular tricks. The only exception is that depending on how many tricks you did prior to scoring you will gain more points such as 2 or 3 points and deduct more points from the other team. There’s also none of that visual flair that the Gamebreaker tricks had other than a different visual filter. Another new element to the Gamebreaker system is if you lose the ball the other team can actually go into Gamebreaker mode. This is a nice concept since it keeps you on your toes more but in some cases you may lose the ball to a cheap move or simply a gameplay error which can be frustrating.Of course Homecourt being a PS3 title the game has gotten a graphical boost. The various courts in the game, which are all based on real courts, are visually sharp and have nice details to them. The character models are also good and mirror the real-life counterparts but they have somewhat of a shiny look to them which looks like they’re perpetually sweating. While the courts are visually nice they’re missing some of that character the made up courts had in the previous NBA Streets. There are several visual filters used in the game which help add some character to the game but at times they can be overused and potentially cover up any flaws the graphics have. In the end the visuals in Homecourt are pretty solid but nothing amazing or awe-inspiring. Another returning feature is the career mode. Just like the other Streets you create a baller and work your way through the trenches competing against other NBA players as you progress. There are no real changes made to the latest version compared to others which may disappoint some. The only real change to the mode is that you travel from various courts through the game. Each court has different matches you can play with the eventual meeting with the NBA player before progressing. There is some variety to the matches since some consist of dunks only, shots only or a certain point requirement. Sadly you don’t face any legends in the game such as Michael Jordan nor will you encounter any of the made up legends such as Stretch or Takahashi. It should be noted though that there is an upcoming Xbox Live expansion for Homecourt which does feature 8 Street legends such as Stretch but at this time there is no word of this hitting the PS Store yet.A rather odd feature is the create-a-baller mode. Instead of adjusting your players’ height and other attributes you select the position you wish to play as and then select a template face. Other than that you have no control over what your baller looks like or his attributes. Instead of upgrading your skills through experience points, the game automatically adjusts your skills based on your performance in the game. So if you do a lot of dunks then you’ll get some dunk experience. This may disappoint some since you never have any control over your progression through the game. An interesting new feature is by unlocking certain clothes and wearing them you can gain experience quicker. So if you wear the unlocked Jordan jersey and Air Jordan’s then you’ll have a faster time leveling up.Homecourt is also a bit light on content. While there are the standard games mode the create-a-homecourt and create-a-sneaker modes are not in the game. These were some nice aspects that were featured on Vol.3 and it would’ve been nice to see them in Homecourt. And the dunk contest mode from Vol. 3 is also missing. While the dunk mode did have some issues it was a fun mode and it’s really disappointing that EA didn’t include this or try to build upon it. There is an online mode that is pretty solid. You can play both ranked and unranked matches. The online experience is pretty good and doesn’t feature any lag or slowdown that could potentially ruin the experience.Homecourt is a solid title but in the end it’s almost the same experience that we’ve been playing for the past few years. Despite the addition of a new trick control scheme the game doesn’t really do anything that sets itself apart from the previous Streets. It also loses some of that flair the the Street titles are known for. If you’re a veteran of the Street series you may want to rent the game before committing to the purchase. However if you’re a newbie of the Street series then you may dig the game for its fun gameplay and sharp visuals. ',\n",

       "  'description': 'The Nintendo DS has been known to have unique games that take advantage of the innovative touch screen. Guitar Hero: On Tour not only successfully makes use of the touch screen but it offers fans of the series a chance to be a rock star anywhere they want.   Since this is a handheld game the full size plastic guitar is out of the question. Instead On Tour ships with a peripheral that slides inside the Game Boy Advance slot on the DS. The peripheral is essentially a grip which consists of four fret buttons (green, red, yellow and blue), a guitar pick and a strap to secure your hand in place. After playing a few songs the controller becomes rather uncomfortable and might be a problem for those that have bigger hands. Unfortunately the controller doesn\\'t snap into the Game Boy Advance slot so if you find yourself rocking out too hard then the controller slips out of the slot and requires you to power off the DS and start the game over again.   The game play is similar to the previous Guitar Hero games but what makes this installment distinct is the touch screen features. As always you must press the correct color fret button that matches the notes on the screen. Sliding the guitar pick back and forth on the screen emulates strumming. This works surprisingly well since it is rather responsive and lag free.   Since there isn\\'t a whammy bar to distort the sound on the controller the alternative is to quickly move the guitar pick back in forth whenever long notes are being held. It\\'s an easy way to rack up on more points. Another example of the touch screen game play is the way in which \"Star Power\" is enabled. To feel like a true rock star you can say \"Rock On\" into the microphone to activate Star Power, or if you\\'re more on the shy side you can blow into the microphone or even touch the Star Power meter. While this may seem creative it doesn\\'t always necessarily work. The microphone on the DS is sensitive and picks up any loud noises which will randomly cause the star power to activate. Since this happens quite a bit it makes it hard to play on the go which totally defeats the purpose of the game.   There is a significant amount of game mode options that are included in the game. Of course there are the standard Career and Quick Play modes which are basically the same as other Guitar Hero games. Practice is another mode but it doesn\\'t seem too useful since there isn\\'t an option to change the speed of the song so you can perfect those parts in the song where you get lost. Out of the entire options multiplayer is where the game shines. Unfortunately there isn\\'t Wi-Fi multiplayer but linking up with a friend in the same place works just as well. There are a number of modes that can be played such as Face-Off (playing against your opponent to see gets the most points), Co-op (you and your friend play songs together), and Guitar Duel. Guitar Duel is similar to Face Off but you are given the opportunity to throw items at your opponent to hinder their performance. A few examples of this is where the music is muted but the notes still appear across the screen; repairing broken strings and putting out the fire that has encompassed the guitar.   Guitar Hero: On Tour isn\\'t the best looking game on the DS but it definitely captures the Guitar Hero style. There are five venues to select from; Subway, Rooftop, Parade, Greek Arena and Battleship which fully pulls off the atmosphere of each one. There are a few familiar characters in the game but you can\\'t really tell since the character models aren\\'t detailed at all. On the other hand the various guitars that are available look great while they are enlarged on the touch screen. The size of the screens doesn\\'t seem to make a difference since it is easy to see the notes that scroll down.   The DS does have some small speakers but you wouldn\\'t be able to tell since the music sounds great. There is the option to plug in headphones to get the full experience but you should have no problem hearing the music if you are playing in a fairly quite area. There are a total of 25 songs in the entire game. While this is nowhere near the amount of songs in the previous Guitar Hero games, it is amazing to have that many songs on a small cartridge. When it comes to song selection On Tour tends to have more of a lighter feel to it as opposed to Hard Rock and Metal. The artists range from No Doubt to Ozzy Osbourne. There is definitely a good mixture of songs here and the bonus is that the majority of them are master tracks.   Sadly On Tour doesn\\'t offer a lot when it comes to value. As always there are four difficulty levels to perfect and the multiplayer modes are a blast that will leave you wanting more. The problem seems to be with the short 25 song set list. After a while the songs tend to get a bit stale especially when you are constantly playing them over and over again in order to practice. It would be great if there were songs that were available to download but that obviously won\\'t happen. This game is great to pick up and play for short periods of time.  Overall Guitar Hero: On Tour is a fun game that gives players a different way to play. While the game and the controller aren\\'t perfect it sure does make up by for it by giving you the opportunity to be a Guitar Hero on the Nintendo DS.',\n",

       " {'deck': 'Flow manages to captivate players with its simplistic charm',\n",
       "  'description': 'One of the most anticipated Playstation Store games has finally hit the market. Flow represents an interesting concept of having a gameplay experience yet not really being a game itself. Flow is more of an experience you can just sit back and go with the flow.Flow was originally a Flash game made by college students. While you can still play the Flash version of Flow online the new version is essentially a different experience. The gameplay is the same as you play an organism that can eat up other organisms and grow bigger. The game has a total of 5 forms you can play as with each form having around 10 or so zones that you can level up in. Flow isn’t a long game and it’s possible for one to finish the game in around 2 hours. But the concept of Flow isn’t about how long it is or how many enemies you kill, it’s all about sitting back and just enjoying the experience. The graphics in Flow may not have the powerhouse visuals like Motorstorm but once again Flow isn’t all about the visuals. However the game does have some amazing imagery. Seeing your white colored character against the dark backdrop of the level with particles flowing really is a treat to see. It’s also really cool seeing some the ‘boss’ organisms you face since some of them take up the entire screen. Some other reviews of Flow have mentioned cases of slowdown which is in the game but it’s not really noticeable nor does it affect gameplay.Perhaps the best feature of Flow is the music. Similar to the cult game Rez, Flow features an interactive music setup. So every time you eat an organism a musical cue is played. So when you really get your flow going and eat multiple organisms you’re given a really cool musical combo. Flow also has some really calming music and you may find yourself just listening to the music that plays on the XMB selection screen since its so relaxing.Flow also uses the Sixaxis controller to control your organism. It does take awhile getting used to since some organisms have different speeds but after half an hour it’s possible to play the game with one hand since the controls are really responsive.As you progress through the different zones and forms you will encounter a really cool mix or organisms. Some organisms form defensive shields or will attack you in groups while others can go stealth and attack you with paralyzing venom. Overtime as you change forms you will get different abilities, such as the stealth and paralyzing power, which keeps the game fresh.In the end Flow is not a true revolutionary title but it is something you should check out. Flow may not have that long term replayability that other games have but it’s something you should support since the game industry could use more titles like this instead of another WWII fps or sports game ',\n",

The single player campaign is a little short (8-12 hours), but it's fun and entertaining; it becomes ten times better if you're playing co-op with three friends. As you would expect from a Halo, the Multiplayer is a lot of fun. There's a lot of customization with both the game modes and maps (thanks to the forge map editor), which makes custom games a blast with friends. Match Making is also a lot of fun if you don't mind playing with people you don't know; there are alot of playlist, which means there is likely one that fits you style of play (my favorite is Team Objection). Add the awsome replay function (which allows you to take clips and screenshots from multiplayer matches), and you have\\xa0yourself a\\xa0very nice package that has plenty of features\\xa0and a lot of fun. Halo 3's presentation is top notch, and the sound (from the sound effecets, to the voice acting, to the amazing music) is some of the best in the biz.\\xa0While the\\xa0graphics aren't\\xa0the best I've ever seen,\\xa0they are fairly nice and do get\\xa0 the job done; what Halo 3's graphics lack technologically is more than made up by it's awsome art style and color scheme (yay, I see more than just brown mush).

       " {'deck': 'Undertow is can easily be put as simply terrible.',\n",
       "  'description': \"Undertow recently has gained attention as of late because its the free XBLA game we were promised. I suppose. Whether or not it would be warrant a purchase before/after this sale (ends Sunday, January 27th), I suggest for one you at least download it before hand. Whether or not you will play it after you grow bored of it.  Undertow deals with for one, fighting in under water. The main plot is an aquatic alien race is launching a secret attack on Earth which would melt the polar ice caps. Whether or not this jumps out at you, literally, to make it worse, it attempts to use a story.  Whether this actually makes sense to you, I'm talking cut scenes of talking and such. While this would normally be great, this is an Arcade game. Not suppose to really have a story, and/or cinematic type of scenes. But this does, and it doesn't work. Thank god there is a skip button, because thats what you will be doing. And a rewind button, if your like, crazy.  But basically back on track, a bunch of people left from a group and you have to fight off the alien enemies one Act at a time, yes! Wait, not yes. You start off learning the game, as you need to kill a certain amount of enemies per level (usually 200, goes to 350), you also need to get control points, for more of your men to respawn and so, with that being said, you will have less enemies to deal with.  Anyways, lets actually start. To begin with, Undertow is apparently ran with the Unreal Engine, and for an Arcade game, it looks nice. Not amazing, but nice. While many people have given their frustration on the controls, I think they are probably one of the highlights of the game. You move with the left analog stick, and shoot in any direction with the right analog stick. You get 4 classes to choose (Marine, Destroyer, and two other ones.) All of these classes have different types of abilities. You can upgrade these classes to a max of 3 (by earning points, killing things, getting capture points, etc), and unfortunately every level you have to do the same thing...again and again...  Before the end of each Act, you must face this Alien boss, and well...its not fun. Its the same each Act, and is surprisingly more boring each time. The thing is, after the first Act everything is the same. Boring, and well, hard. Mention hard. Unless I'm a terrible Arcade player, on the Normal difficulty I found it hard at points to win a damn match. I was winning 130 men to 20 men, they had 4 capture points and I had one, thats not the point, but all of a sudden they storm me and win...how? I have no idea, I guess its my talents, but my talents are so amazing that it might have just been a glitch. Yes, lets go with that.  There is a easier difficulty below that, and one hard above it. I cannot imagine hard, as it must be literally hell. There is a multi player aspect, in which you can face up to 16 people in a team death match or conquest like match, basically taking capture points in each. You can also play each chapter/acts in co-op, if your like into that sort of thing. There are also leader boards if you wish to compare your 'amazing' stats with everyone else. One play through got me in the top 1000 in like score/kills, so, yeah. Either I'm amazing or nobody is really playing the game. Or maybe both.  Basically, it boils down to if you want to play this type of game or not. Its free, and if you don't like it, never play it again. Go through at least one Act so you can get an achievement. Speaking of which, anybody going for the 10k kills achievement? Might be the only thing that is worth doing in this god damn game.  The Good: It was between Jan 23rd - Jan 27th. Co-op, multiplayer. Graphics are OK.  The Bad: Repetition in every level, the cut scenes suck, voice acting is definitely not great, frustrating difficulty even on the normal setting. Probably anything else. January 23rd to January 27th is long gone.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Def Jam Icon is the next-gen installment in the popular Def Jam fighting franchise. The previous installments were not only fun due to their gameplay but due to the fact that they felt like an actual game and not quick cash-in ala 50 Cent Bulletproof. DJ Icon does retain some elements that made the previous titles interesting while completely revamping others.Def Jam Icon is developed by EA Chicago, the team responsible for the Fight Night series and not by Aki who handled the first two Def Jam titles. EA Chicago’s influence clearly shows through the amazing visuals and the games combat system which heavily utilizes the right analog stick. The combat in Icon consists the normal face button setup which covers your basic heavy and light punches/kicks. The right analog stick handles throws and extreme punches and kicks. For those familiar with the Fight Night games should feel at home with Icon since the combat is essentially ‘Fight Night Street Combat’. For those unfamiliar with the Fight Night scheme you control extreme punches and kicks by arcing the right analog stick in different directions. You’ll have to time your punches well or face getting owned by your opponent. The core concept of the combat system is good but pales in comparison to the previous titles, which heavily focused on grappling and over the top finishing moves. A fan favorite from the previous game, the Blazing moves, is MIA in Icon and there are no real finishing moves in the game. Icon’s combat also feels a bit sluggish and methodical and doesn’t have that quick fire feel of previous Def Jam title.The actual implementation of the right analog stick in combat is a bit of a mixed bag. While the moves that are mapped to the right analog stick are flashy, at times they’re a bit hard to pull off since there is slight delay from when you press the button to the actual on-screen reaction. It also takes awhile to get used to using the face buttons for the main attacks and then switch to the right analog stick and hope you can pull off a move before the enemy disrupts your flow. That being said Icon does have a steep learning curve compared to the previous Def Jams. Don’t be expecting to go into a match on your first try and winning, chances are you will probably lose or barely win the match. Icon does have a practice mode in which you can practice your skills on the various stages in the game but there no explanations to performing specific moves in the game. An example of Icon’s mixed bag fighting is that there is no grappling or submissions in the game. The previous Def Jam’s were a mix of fighting and wrestling style moves. None of that is in Icon but there are some small grapple moves you can perform such as a suplex but how you perform that is based on properly blocking your opponents attack. At the end of the day the combat in Icon isn’t a lot of fun due to the sloppy combat controls and the overall lack of moves.However Icon does have a highlight and that’s the music integration. The music in the game is a weapon in itself and the player can actually manipulate it to their advantage. Each environment in the game has certain hazardous that react to the beat of the music. The player can manipulate the beat of the music by using the DJ Turntable controls. By holding down the L2 button and rotating the left or right analog stick the player can speed up the music to activate an environment hazard. Not only does the music activate hazards but the environment animates to it. So some levels will have lights on skyscrapers animate to the beat of the music while others will have debris moving to the beat. Also over time the environment will break so pieces of a building or even a car will be in pieces. This feature, of having music as a weapon, certainly sets Icon apart from other fighting games and is a nice addition to the Def Jam franchise. Icon of course has a good soundtrack or else this feature would be a waste. Each of the artists in the game has a song of theirs to represent them. You can also select a song before you battle. So if there’s a song that you like a lot and really know the rhythm of you can choose that to use to your advantage during combat.EA Chicago set the bar in terms of visuals with Fight Night and they matched and in some respects exceeded what they did in Fight Night. All of the character models match their real world counter parts with eerie realism. Characters clothing and jewelry will sway realistically and over time their clothing will accumulate dirt and blood as the fight intensifies. The animations in the game are pretty slick but at times can seem a bit too stiff compared to the previous Def Jam. The games 8 environments each have certain visual characteristics that set them apart whether it’s a rooftop with a swaying helicopter or a packed night club. There is some noticeable aliasing with some aspects of the environments but it’s not something that is so noticeable that it takes you out of the experience.Just like its predecessor Icon features a story mode that encompasses your rise in the rap industry, corrupt cops, rival record labels and a politician with a mysterious agenda. The game starts out with you talking to your mentor on the streets of New York when suddenly he’s shot in a drive by and the game then goes 2 years in the past to when you first encounter your mentor. From there you become part of the rap industry and that means pleasing your talent and signing new talent. A new element to the Def Jam franchise is that you can manage your label. You can decide what artists you sign, allocate money for album releases and receive email from your artists and enemies. This aspect of the game is a nice addition but it never has any impact on the story itself. The only effect the album managing has is your Icon ranking which consists of how many albums have gone gold or platinum and your total respect. The story in Icon is somewhat puzzling. While it is pretty well written and is probably one of the best stories in a fighting game it does find itself in a way embracing several stereotypes. Unlike the other Def Jams which featured rappers but took place in a fantasy world of underground fight clubs, Icon takes place in the record industry. So in a way the game is portraying the stereotype that the rap industry is filled with nothing but thugs and several of the artists requests such as buying Lil Jon’s entourage a fleet of cars or a members being arrested for ‘mysterious’ charges further play into this. It’s a bit unclear if EA was trying to play into that ‘glam’ factor the street aspect of the rap industry has or if they were taking a tongue in cheek aspect to it. The story however shouldn’t offend anyone based on its portrayals of the main cast, so in the end it’s a matter of preference whether the story in Icon pleases you or not. And in typical hip-hop fashion the game ends in a twist with a conspiracy and the games credits even acknowledges this.Icon also allows you to create your own fighter to use both in the story mode and regular mode. If you’re familiar with the Fight Night create-a-character system then that’s pretty much what Icon uses. The options for some attributes such as hair and facial hair are a bit limiting and you also can’t choose a different head type for further customization. Unlike Fight For New York you can’t choose the voice of your character so it’s missing that final unique touch. Of course you can pimp your character out with clothing from Sean John, Adidas, Nike Air Jordan and all the latest bling such as massive chains that would put Ali G to shame. While you can create your own character you can’t customize his attributes like the previous Def Jams. This hampers the game in a way since you never feel more powerful as you progress through the game.The biggest problem with Icon is its lack of features. While the music integration and story aspects are good there are a handful of features missing from Icon. The first and perhaps biggest issue with the game is the roster of rappers is a bit ‘meh.’ You do have artists like Ludacris, Big Boi, The Game, E-40, Ghost Face Killah and Fat Joe but there are still several Def Jam icons missing in action. Where’s LL Cool J, Jay-Z, or perhaps even Run DMC as the ultimate legend unlockable? You also can’t play as any female fighters. While there are several female characters in the games story mode you sadly can’t unlock any of them so you can’t have your ultimate cat fight fantasy. Icon is also lacking in game modes. While the game does feature online play for the first time, there is no 4 player support in the game. So you and some buddies can’t compete in a Battle Royale or compete in a tag team competition. This lack of variety also affects Icon’s single game mode. While its predecessor, Fight For New York, featured different stages that had different element such as Ring matches, Fire matches, and area’s that changed how you play such as the Subway level, Icon features none of that. All the stages in the game are essentially the same except for the few environmental hazards. So it may get a bit boring after awhile when you play the Club level for the 15th time and know all the hazards like the back of your hand.Def Jam Icon represents an interesting step for the franchise but for every positive feature there are a handful of things that take the game down. The graphics are good, the concept of using the music as a weapon is good but is held down by a poor fighting system and lack of features. Many fans wanted the Def Jam: Fight For New York fighting system to return but instead they get a street version of the Fight Night controls. Icon also doesn’t have that long term replay factor the other titles have so once you’ve finished the story mode there isn’t a lot to go back to. And while EA Chicago should be applauded in trying to do something original they deviated so far from what made the previous Def Jams fun that they ultimately alienate the Def Jam fans and their core audience. The game definitely has good visuals and a solid soundtrack but as a fighting game Icon falls flat. ',\n",

       " {'deck': 'Resistance offers an old school style fps with next-gen power',\n",
       "  'description': 'Whenever a new console launches there is usually one title that either defines the system or easily becomes the killer app. Resistance is clearly the #1 title for the PS3 at launch. Insomniac, the developers behind the Spyro and Ratchet and Clank series, go back to their roots with Resistance since their first title for the PS1 was a game called Disruptor. While Resistance doesn’t change or add anything new to the FPS genre or present CG quality visuals, it is still one of the best FPS games to have been released in the past few years.Resistance revolves around the invasion by the Chimera, a species of unknown origin that have spread from Russia to the U.K. The Chimera is a force to be reckoned with and can infect humans to replenish their forces. You take the role of Nathan Hale, an American soldier sent to England to combat the Chimera. Hale and his squad are infected by the Chimera shortly after landing in England with Hale being the only survivor. From there the story revolves around the mystery as to why Hale hasn’t changed into a Chimera and where the Chimera come from. While most action or FPS games, such as Gears of War, present a slim story Resistance offers a deep story that is presented in an interesting fashion. At the start and end of each level a cinema, told occasionally through black & white still images, cues the player as to the background of the Chimera as well as to the player’s current location. While these cut scenes are not long they do a good of advancing the story and keeping the player informed.As with any launch game the graphics are an important factor. When compared to Gears of War Resistance may not look that good, but for a launch game the visuals are quite good and extremely polished. Resistance has excellent art design along with a variety of locales ranging from the war torn streets of Manchester, Chimeran controlled fish canneries and the pits of Chimeran tunnels. The art design of the levels is one of the games strongest points since it keeps the game fresh and interesting. The excellent art design is also carried over to the Chimeran enemies and human soldiers. Both have various details such as swaying backpacks or air hissing out of tubes on their backs. Another strong visual point is the various effects of the weapons. Some weapons shoot fire, emit shields, and electricity. The various effects of the weapons both show off the visuals of the game along with keeping game interesting. In the end Resistance may not be the tour de force of the PS3’s graphical power but it does make an impact as a launch title.If you play Resistance and expect revolutionary gameplay such as physics based combat or a unique covering system then Resistance offers none of that. Instead Resistance is an old fashioned straight forward FPS. It’s a standard linear game but every aspect of the game is top notch. The level design is good and overall the game is challenging when playing on the standard medium difficulty setting. The Chimera will take cover as well as follow you to certain areas. When playing Resistance there are times when it’s best to go full force into an environment, while other times you need to take the area on strategically, taking on each enemy encounter at a time. Occasionally there are some vehicle portions of the game. Expect to control both a tank and a jeep. These vehicle portions are a bit short but are fun and are a break from the intense combat. One thing Resistance does well is presenting showcase moments. There are quite a few moments in the game that are a bit unexpected as well as shocking. Seeing dozens of Chimera crawlers cascading down a city building and homing in on your position is quite cool and a bit of a shock since it’s an unexpected moment. Resistance also has some really cool showpiece levels that make you feel that you’re in a battlefield. The Manchester level is the best example of this since the area is war torn with dilapidated buildings. In this level the Chimera forces are at full force and there are dozens of soldiers on the battlefield. Insomniac manages to continue this trend of showpiece moments and encounters through the game’s 30 level single player campaign which should take most around 8 hours to complete. Resistance doesn’t offer anything new in terms of gameplay but it does stand up to and surpass the recent FPS hits of the past few years.Another key aspect of the game is the weapons. Insomniac is best known for their crazy weapons in the Ratchet and Clank series and they continue that tradition with Resistance. There is a wide variety of weapons ranging from both human and Chimera. All the weapons have either an alternate fire or weapon. For example the Bullseye alt function is firing a homing tag that will return fire to the tagged enemy despite where you’re pointing the gun. Another example is the Auger which fires through walls and its alt function is projecting a temporary shield in front of you. All the weapons are interesting and all have unique traits and rates of fire. Not all weapons are unlocked during your first play through so it’s encouraged that you play again to unlock some of the crazier weapons.As with any FPS game the controls are an important part. If you’re playing a breakneck game that requires precision but the controls are poor then that will completely ruin the game. Happily Resistance has excellent controls. Control with the analog sticks is sharp and the speed of movement is perfect. Using the new L2 and R2 buttons for secondary command are fine and the overall control layout is perfect. Resistance also utilizes the Sixaxis control of the PS3 controller. When playing in single player you can shake the controller when an enemy attacks you to shake them off. The Sixaxis is also used in the multiplayer part of the game. When tagged by an enemies weapon shaking the controller with shake the weapons tag off you. The same shaking mechanic is used when you’re on fire. While the Sixaxis control is not that deep it is still interesting and doesn’t feel tacked on.Resistance also offers top notch audio. Both the music and voice acting is varied and very professional. There isn’t a lot of in game chatter but during the cut scenes the voice acting is on par with other story driven games and certainly surpassed Gears of War. The music is also excellent and really immerses the player into the game.FPS games are known for the multiplayer modes. In some cases this can either make or break a game. Thankfully Resistance has a good amount of modes both old and new. There are a total of 5 multiplayer modes. They include, deathwatch, team deathmatch, capture the flag, Meltdown, and Breach. Meltdown and Breach both revolve around destroying an enemy’s base and taking over it. These modes along with the others are interesting and make for fun matches. The various maps for the MP modes are based off levels found in the single plater game. Of course these maps are slightly different and offer key positions if you’re into sniping or straight up shooting. Most importantly there is no lag in the game and finding a match is easy. Resistance also offers good stat tracking along with ranking the player based on their performance. By playing ranked matches the player can get various ribbons and medals based off certain achievements such as melee kills, head shots, and multiple kills. This is a good way off offering achievements since PS3 online offers no achievements points. Resistance does include co-op play but its only offline via splitscreen. There is no online co-op which is the only downside to the game.In the end Resistance may not be a revolutionary game but it does make a major impact as a launch title. It’s an old school shooter that will surely engage old school players and new players. If you like a story driven FPS that also has deep multi-player modes then Resistance is the game to own if you have a PS3. ',\n",

       " {'deck': 'Genji offers a solid experience despite having some flaws',\n",
       "  'description': 'Genji is probably one of the most talked about PS3 games but for all the wrong reasons. At E3 2006 it got the attention of many due to a somewhat poor stage demo complete with the instant catchphrases of the year ‘Massive Damage’ and ‘Real Time Weapon Switching’ along with having ‘historically’ accurate monster crabs. Many have shrugged Genji off since E3 but Genji is actually one of the more surprising launch titles.Genji Days of the Blade picks up 3 years after the events of the first Genji. The hero of the first game, Yoshi has successfully driven away the Heishi forces. The land is in a state of peace until the Heishi strike again imbued with the power of Amahagane, divine stones that bring godlike power to its wielder. Yoshi and his partner, Benkei, have to take on the Heishi along with the help of two new characters, Gozen Shizuka and Lord Buson. Both of these new characters have their own motivations as to fighting along with Yoshi and Benkei and taking down the Heishi. Genji has a good story and if you’re a fan of the previous installment or the Onimusha series then you’ll certainly like Genji’s mix of fantasy and historical events.Genji’s combat system does have more than the ‘Massive Damage’ and ‘Real Time Weapon Switching’. The combat system for Genji is actually quite good and easy to get a grip off. Each of the four playable characters has their move sets and abilities. Yoshi can jump onto ledges, Benkei and push objects, Gozen can use her weapon to swing between ledges and Lord Buson wields a double saber. You can also upgrade your weapons and abilities to become more powerful. The system may not be that deep compared to other titles but it’s still nice to have. Another major feature of Genji’s combat is the Kamui mode. When your gauge fills up you can press L1 which sends the player and the surrounding enemies to another plane of existence. Once in Kamui mode the player can effortlessly take out all the enemies through timed button presses. Using Kamui mode is a good way to take out large groups of enemies since at times you will be fighting 10 enemies at once. Kamui mode is also visually stunning due to its somewhat ethereal look.Control is an important aspect of any game and Genji does quite well in this category. Dodging enemy attacks and fighting 10 foes at once can be quite effortless at times thank to the easy control scheme. Performing combos is easy and the controls really make the player feel the role of an ancient Japanese warrior.The visuals are another surprising part of Genji. While the game may not be on par with future PS3 titles such as Heavenly Sword or Devil May Cry 4, it is a very sharp title and has excellent art design. Each character and environment has a unique color palette and design which really immerses the player into the world. Genji’s opening level starts off with very impressive fire and smoke elements complete with heat blur. From there the environments only get more impressive both from a visual and art design standpoint. One of the most impressive levels is one that takes place in a forest with sunlight shining through the trees and falling leaves, it almost seems like a scene taken from the films Hero or House of Flying Daggers. The characters also are very visually appealing thanks to flowing hair and swaying clothing. There is some occasional slowdown during intense battles but not enough to ruin gameplay.While Genji may be backed by impressive combat and visuals the core gameplay is a bit flawed. The levels are very straightforward and the player is often forced to backtrack to find certain items or to open doors. The game is much longer compared to Genji 1 but you may grow tired of doing the same item quest/combat/boss routine for 10 hours plus. The gameplay is also hindered by the camera. Genji employs a Resident Evil style camera that despite offering cool camera views really bogs down the gameplay. At times you won’t see all the enemies and sudden changes in the camera may confuse the player. If Genji allowed the player some form of control over the camera it would’ve helped greatly during some portions of the game. It is nice that the player can switch between any four of the characters but it is not really needed during gameplay except for a few occasions such as selecting Benkei to destroy a rock boulder.Genji’s most impressive part is its audio. There are tons of cutscene’s throughout the game and both the voice acting and score is top notch. Unlike the last Genji, all the voice overs are in English and not in Japanese. This may disappoint some but it’s not really a major issue. All the voice actors are professional and the score is on par with films of the similar genre such as Hero or Crouching Tiger. Genji’s audio is definitely the flawless part of the game and should keep players interested in the story thanks to the compelling performances.Genji certainly deserves more credit than its getting. While there may be some issues in the game it is still an enjoyable experience. If you’re a big fan of standard hack n’ slash games then you should give Genji a shot. While the camera is a bit crap at times and the core gameplay can get old Genji is still a solid combat title. Hopefully the developers, Game Republic, will listen to what game players have said and give Genji another shot. ',\n",

       "  'description': \"Much has been said about Ninja Theory's action-adventure starring the fiery red-head Nariko. Called a shameless God of War clone with roots going back to the days of the original XBox and reviews both amazingly positive and crushingly mediocre, Heavenly Sword has had a hard stand leading up to its release.The title's namesake, a powerful blade once wielded by a celestial hero and now guarded by a warrior tribe awaiting the foretold rebirth of said hero is the object of King Bohan's desire. You play as the aforementioned beauty Nariko, a member of the sword keepers who are relentlessly hunted by Bohan's enormous army. When her father is captured by the malicious tyrant, she sees no other choice than to wield the legendary blade herself, well-knowing that any mortal carrying it into battle will inevitably be devoured by the sword's lust for blood.The story remains entertaining throughout the game which is mostly a testimony to the great dialog and charismatic characters coupled with a fantastic presentation similar to movies like Hero. However, one can't help but think that some elements, more specifically Bohan's crow ally, could have been more fleshed out and might have actually been kept in the dark for a possible sequel.The Heavenly Sword is actually two separate blades though, as Nariko has the choice between three different stances. Per default, she'll be using the speed stance allowing her to trade quick blows, while the power stance merges the two blades into one colossal zweihander for great amounts of damage at the cost of agility. Lastly, the range stance attaches the two blades onto long chains reaching farther off enemies and excellent for mowing down her immediate surroundings at the expense of all blocking capabilities.Incidentally, blocking is performed automatically, given you're in the stance your attacker is currently using. This is signaled by a short, colored flash around attacking enemies, of which there usually are about a dozen, carefully circling our heroine, waiting for the opportune moment. While most enemies will stick to the default speed stance early on, later parts of the game can get rather hectic with different enemies attacking at the same time with various attacks, demanding a great deal of careful attention and reflexes.More demanding than the common grunt enemies are the few but lengthy boss battles, each of which demands a fair amount of strategy as you use Nariko's stances to counter their hard-hitting special attacks. At certain points during boss battles and sometimes while traversing terrain, you're forced into timed button pressing sequences similar to games like Shenmue or God of War, which are noticeably more difficult, but often result in rewarding cinematics as Nariko wears her enemies down.You'll not be fighting solely as Nariko however, her emotionally scarred sister Kai gets some play-time as well. Her parts play vastly different from Nariko's as the nimble Kai is equipped with only an automated crossbow and not trained in any melee combat, so you'll always want to keep a save distance between her and her targets. Although some of her sequences tend to drag on a bit, Kai is certainly a welcomed diversion and her quirky character and funny monologues make her a joy to play.Like all projectiles in the game, notably the sparsely available rocket launcher and just about any debris or weapon on the ground, Kai's bolts can be steered via after-touch using the Sixaxis' tilty-support. This technique incidentally works quite well after a few tries and if you feel uncomfortable with it, there's always the option to turn it off. There are even a couple of environmental puzzles requiring precise throws, however they are usually not overly complicated and few and far between.Simply by looking at a couple of pictures, it quickly becomes apparent that the game looks marvelously, thanks to not only the stunning art design but also great technical proficiency. The most outstanding features are the incredible facial animations throughout the game, used to give every character the kind of expressiveness other games are lacking. This becomes apparent during the many cutscenes done with professional actors and directed by motion-capture-experienced actor Andy Serkis, who played Golum and King Kong. The environments are similarly charming in their architecture and the graphics engine is capable of handling hundreds of enemies on screen fairly well. It's of notice however that the frame rate feels constantly slow, not to the extend of unplayability, but it's definitely noticeable. The audio in the game is just as fantastic as the visuals, featuring razor-sharp dialog coupled with fantastic acting. And while the plot is certainly sinister and dark, you can't help but giggle when Kai threatens a soldier to hit his weak point for massive damage. The entire soundtrack is just as outstanding with an orchestral score accompanying the action-packed adventure.Even with all that praise though, Heavenly Sword's weakness is its disappointingly short length. An experienced player can finish the game within 6-7 hours and while there are a ton of unlockable extras as well as a harder difficulty mode once you finished Nariko's vengeance tour, it's hard to justify the full price. However, the production values are certainly there and the game is a fantastic experience from start to finish. One can only wonder what might have been, if the experience lasted just a bit longer...\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Rockstar North has created the best game that I have ever played. They have created a game with fantastic gameplay, great online play, and a masterful story, full of grest characters. I can\\'t give it anything other than my highest recommendation.\\xa0You play as Niko Bellic, a war veteran who comes to Liberty City, USA, (Modeled after New York City,) after his cousin, Roman, tells him about how he has great wealth, a mansion, sports cars, etc. As Niko soon finds out though, Roman was lying. This starts Niko off on a long journey, that even surpasses Assassin\\'s Creed in terms of story quality. The cast of characters in GTA 4 are all incredibly well defined, and grow on you as the story progresses. At the points where i was given a decision to make, i found myself thinking of how each decision could affect the other characters in the game, before I made the decision.\\xa0This game introduces new gameplay mechanics to the series. One of them is the the new gun-fighting methods. It is now cover based and players can target individual body parts. As great as the gunplay is though, the close combat does not work that well. Thankfully, you don\\'t need to do a lot of it. Niko also has a cell phone that can be used to access missions, communicate with characters, and access multiplayer. Vehicles now control more realistically. Police chases are now radius based. The A.I. in this game is very smart. Enemies will use cover, react differently based on where they are shot, pedestrians will even call the police if they see you do anything bad. Once you complete the story, there is still a lot that you can do. There\\'s deliveries, \"Exotic Exports,\" assassination missions, races, stunt jumps, random characters, etc. You can also hang out with/date some characters. Doing so with some provides bonuses for Niko, such as the ability to call for backup, or the ability to call a discount gun salesman.\\xa0GTA 4 is the first game in the series to include online multiplayer. In multiplayer, up to sixteen players are dropped into the entire city to play one of fifteen game modes, including the standard deathmatch and race, and inventive modes like Bomb da Base II and Cops n\\' Crooks. The online play is lag free and plays great.\\xa0GTA 4\\'s graphics are much improved over previous games in the series, thanks to Rockstar\\'s R.A.G.E. engine. There is occasional pop-in. I only experienced slow down during one mission, (To the game\\'s credit though, it was a really hectic mission.) The voice-work, original score, and sound effects are great, the former helping define the characters. There are also over 200 licensed song that are played over the game\\'s radio stations, covering a wide variety genres, so you\\'re almost guaranteed to find a that you\\'ll like, (And if not, you can listen to one of the humorous talk-radio stations.)In conclusion, GTA 4 is the best game that I have ever played. The gameplay, the story, the multiplayer, everything is absolutely fantastic. I recommend it to every. If you haven\\'t played it yet, go play it now.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Full Auto 2: Battlelines is the PS3 follow up to last year’s Full Auto for the Xbox 360. One would think that with an extra year of development FA2 would fix the issues with FA1 but for the most part that isn’t the case.One of the biggest issues with Full Auto was that none of the cars had a sense of weight to them. They all felt really floaty and equally controlled that way. Battlelines does fix that problem and adds some weight to the cars. Unfortunately the actual car controls still feel a bit loose which can hamper your experience during a race.The first Full Auto bragged about its fully destructible environments, which in the case of gameplay really didn’t affect the race. Battlelines does add a few more interactive pieces which will affect the course of the race. Shooting a stack of pipes will cause them to roll onto the street blocking the road for the racers behind you. While the destructibility is cool it still feels a bit unrefined in terms of actual gameplay uses.Pseudo Interactive had an extra year to polish the game’s graphics for the PS3 but the finished product is just a bit ‘meh’. While the game manages a steady frame rate and the visuals of seeing object get blown up is cool, the overall graphics aren’t that much of a step up from the 360 version. Even though you won’t be able to fully analyze the graphics due to the fast speeds you’re racing, the game does feature some sketchy textures if you slow down. The art design of the various courses is decent but they’re not anything you haven’t seen before and there is no definitive style like the Burnout titles. The actual cars and visual effects are decent but once again they’re not anything you can’t do on the 360 and look somewhat poor compared to a game like Motorstorm.Driving your car is sharp for the most part but drifting around corners is a bit loose and can result in total spinouts. Shooting vehicles is pretty effortless but there are a few problems. The circle and x button handle your primary and secondary weapons while the right analog stick handles targeting. It’s a bit hard to get a precision shot via the right analog stick when you use one of the face buttons to fire despite R3 being a secondary fire button.Battlelines has the standard race modes, career, online, and arcade. Arcade mode is straight up action, career mode has a series of events with different objectives. Unlike Full Auto’s career mode, Battlelines actually attempts a laughable excuse of a story for the career mode. You play as an undercover agent who is being helped by a female A.I computer named SAGE, with her help you need to take down a gang that is holding these dangerous tournaments in the city. Before each race you’ll have to listen to some pretty lame dialogue from SAGE. The career mode is ok but it would’ve been better without the story.Just like Full Auto you can customize your cars with various weapons both in the front and rear. There really isn’t anything different between the previous installment and the newest one. You still have the standard smoke screens, machine guns, and shotgun armaments that you can equip on the various cars which range from sedans and SUVs.The online aspects of Battlelines are decent if you’re aching for some vehicular combat. Battlelines uses Gamespy and not the Playstation Network Platform but you don’t need to make an extra account, it’ll automatically use you PNP account. Online racing has a few modes and race options for users to choose from. When playing online there is no lag so the experience is equal to the single player one.If you’re aching for a PS3 Burnout or the next Twisted Metal the perhaps you should give Full Auto Battlelines a shot. It’s not a perfect title and after half an hour of play you would’ve seen everything the game has to offer. And if you’ve played the 360 version then you pretty much have played Battlelines. Battlelines is a rent and not a buy in the end unless you’re really desperate for some PS3 games. ',\n",

       " {'deck': 'Dark Mirror brings some much needed action to the PSP',\n",
       "  'description': 'When Metal Gear Solid was released in 1998, it spawned a whole series of knock offs. While some were cheap attempts to cash in on the popularity of MGS, only one was actually good. This title was Sony’s Syphon Filter. While more action oriented than MGS, Syphon Filter was able to set itself apart as a solid title. The game was praised by both fans and critics for its game play and Hollywood style action. A more stealth oriented sequel was released a year later to more praise. The third entry of the series was almost unnoticed due to being released after the tragic events of 9/11 and due to stale gameplay. The eagerly anticipated PS2 entry of Syphon Filter was released in 2004, and was panned by both critics and fans. Many fans thought the Syphon Filter had met its end. They can now rest assured that the franchise is back with Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror for Sony’s PSP. Not only is the franchise back on the right track but Dark Mirror is arguably one of the best titles available for the PSP.While Syphon Filter doesn’t boast as heavy and complex a story as MGS, it still holds its own. The first four entries of the series revolved around the Syphon Filter virus. This virus was created with the ability to attack specific demographics, whether it is age, race or gender. As Agent Gabe Logan, your mission was to track down the virus and those behind it. Your trust worthy partner, Lian Xiang, backed you up as you fought your way through terrorist cells and government agents. As you played you saw your standard double crosses and plot twists complete with a mysterious man in the shadows. The Syphon Filter story was wrapped up in the last title Syphon Filter: Omega Strain. This title picks up with Gabe and Lian going after a new terrorist cell called Red SectionOne of the best features of the Syphon Filter games was its controls. Despite missing an analog stick and an extra pair of shoulder buttons, the game controls perfectly. Dark Mirror probably has the best control scheme for a 3rd person shooter available on the PSP. The controls are so perfect that you will never want to have the extra shoulder buttons or analog stick. To control your character, you use the analog nub for movement and aiming is handled with the face buttons. Controlling movement with the analog nub is very tight and doesn’t have that floaty feel like some titles do. The aiming controls may sound awkward to some but are very good. To aim left you would press the square button and if you wanted to aim up you would press triangle. While it does take some getting use to, especially during movement, the system works perfectly once honed. The player can also lock onto targets by holding down the L1 button. This is good in some situations but using the face buttons is more effective most of the time. Gadget and weapon selection is accessed via the d-pad. To access the weapons you would press right and then a menu comes up. This menu features your current weapons assigned to a face button. To equip a weapon you simply press the assigned button. Equipping gadgets is done via the same system. The item selection is well conceived and easy to access during battle. The three elements of movement, aiming and item selection all flow effortlessly during battle and are the new standard of how PSP action games should control.Just like Solid Snake and Sam Fisher, Gabe is well equipped during his missions. Gabe has a slew of gadgets available to him such as night vision and infrared goggles. He also has EDSU goggles that show important features in the environment or weaknesses on enemies. Another useful gadget is the grapple. Gabe can use this gadget to access different parts of levels that were previously inaccessible. The interesting thing about this mechanic is that Gabe can shoot while hooked on the grapple line. This mechanic adds some variety to levels and simply looks cool. Some gadgets are only necessary in certain occasions but they never feel useless or unnecessary. The weapons of Syphon Filter have always been a strong point and this title continues the tradition. You have your standard silencers, automatics and rifles. A new addition to the game is that you can equip different rounds of ammunition to your weapons. Choices of ammo range from explosive, gas and electric. The choices of ammo add some variety to the game since you can dispatch your foes differently. The fan favorite taser once again makes an appearance and looks as brutal as it did on the consoles. Players can also unlock new weapons based on their performance through the game.One of the strongest points of the game is its visuals. When first looking at the game you may think you’re watching a PS2 video running off the memory stick. Syphon Filter has some of the best presentation and visual effects seen on Sony’s handheld. Characters models are crisp and feature various details on their uniforms such as buttons. Gabe’s uniform has different textures that actually make it look like a military uniform. The animations are quite good and accurately depict the actions being performed. Rag doll physics are also used in the game, so enemies die in a realistic fashion. The only bad thing about the visuals is when the characters are talking. This problem is found in the prerendered and in game cutscenes in which the lip synching is a bit off. Another thing is that the character models faces while looking excellent, look stiff while talking. Their facial expressions aren’t that deep and don’t really convey their emotions. Despite these minor issues, the overall level of detail shows how much time the development team has put into the game. Motion blur, which is a problem with some titles, is only slightly evident in the prerendered cinemas. The levels are very crisp and don’t feature any texture stitching or other graphical problems. Jaggies are not as noticeable as some titles and are only evident on certain objects. Various particle effects such explosions, falling snow, and smoke are featured in the game. All of these effects are executed well and further immerse the player into the environments. There is nothing more thrilling than running around a detailed environment with falling snow to draw you into the experience of being a covert operative. An interesting thing about Dark Mirror is its levels. The levels are quite large and include multiple paths. For example, if you want to do a mission stealthy you can, but if you’re more action oriented you can Rambo it up. These paths are a nice way of offering the player to choose their style of gameplay. It also enhances replayability since some paths will offer completely different scenarios. Littered throughout the levels are different files or keycards. These will unlock bonuses in the game like art, cutscenes, and new levels. These items along with the different paths will make you replay certain levels to make sure you get the full experience of the game.The score of Syphon Filter once again lives up to past titles. Omega Strain’s composer, Mark Snow, returns to score Dark Mirror. Mr. Snow is best known for scoring TV shows like The X-Files and Smallville. The score has your standard espionage style themes and they all sound good and don’t get repetitive. Just like past titles Dark Mirror has some good voice acting. For the most par the voice acting is good with the slight exception of Gabe. While the voice actor for Gabe isn’t terrible, his voice is so gritty that it’s kind of laughable. Gabe’s voice sounds like Solid Snake taken to the next level while trying to be serious.Following in the footsteps of Omega Strain, Dark Mirror has a robust multiplayer mode. The standard deathmatch and team deathmatch is available along with several other modes. Dark Mirror supports both Ad-Hoc and Infrastructure play so you can play with a group of buddies or through a wireless connection. The online mode doesn’t feature any real lag so players can expect a good experience. Dark Mirror also supports the PSP headset so you can talk while you play. Syphon Filter is an excellent game and truly shows off what the PSP is capable of. The production value in the visuals, music and control is on par with any PS2 game which is an amazing feat. Dark Mirror should be any PSP collection, whether you’re an action fan or not. The game is a lot of fun and essentially doesn’t have any of the problems that plague other PSP games. Not only does Dark Mirror resurrect a fledging franchise, it brings some much needed action to the PSP. ',\n",

       "  'description': \"I think Civ:Revolution is a great take on the classic Civ gameplay model, with things nicely simplified down to make it easy and fun to play on a console. However I think they may have gone too far, especially with the lack of world customisation. After playing quite a few games on my PS3 I started to long for the ability to create a continent for each faction (mainly because I was starting to tire of bumping into the other factions within a few turns!), and I actually ended up purchasing Civ 4 again on Steam (lost original copy) just to get my fix!Overall though it's a great introduction to the Civ franchise and with a clever patch here and there could be a top class game.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"This is a truly phenomenal game, the sort which drives you to continue playing until the early hours of the morning when your eyes are red and you're on the verge of heart failure. As an enduring fan of the original Star Wars franchise, this proved to be a breath of fresh air.This was also my first venture into the world of role-playing games. I have deeply-entrenched action game sensibilities - I enjoy the immediacy and control of a proficient action title. This made KOTOR frustrating to begin with, but the fighting mechanics are sound and exciting. The lightsaber combat in particular was captured brilliantly. I was very quickly won over.The beauty of this game lies in its meticulous attention to detail. The story is an overarching concern, yet every encounter bears weight, due to the amount of voice acting. Every NPC has its own voice, and whilst after a while you'll hear the same voice actor or sentence in Huttese or Selkath, it makes each encounter more believable than if it were text only. The relationships your player's character forges with other members of his or her team on board the Ebon Hawk are particularly engaging. There's such a diversity - a hardened soldier, the jaded hermit, an optimistic, brilliant warrior, a psychopathic assassin droid - and yet the attention to detail is such that you feel compelled to engage with each one.The other major mechanic for which KOTOR is renowned is its morality system - the ability to follow the light or dark side of the mystical Force, or various shades of grey in between. This affects the kinds of powers, dialogue options and looks of your character, and it's fantastic to have feedback from your crew on the Ebon Hawk relative to which alignment you choose. There are benefits of tending to either extreme - which compels you to spend another 30 hours or so playing through a second time to have every bit that the game has to offer. It's rewarding whichever way you play, though, as the range of responses from characters populating each planet is so rich and diverse.This must be played by any self-respecting Star Wars fan who indulges in video games. It's an outstanding title, one set apart from more recent Western RPG's by its combat system (which is essentially turn-based rather than real time). It moves at a deliberate pace, coming to a stirring conclusion after significant twists and turns. Highly recommended!\",\n",

Now lets start, Grand Theft Auto had so much media hype and every kid from 12 to adults at 50 were exited for this game. Knowing how San Andreas was, we were all expecting a great game with a free world were u can do just about anything and its just extremely fun. The graphics in this game looks great, looking at this on a console was just mind blowing. Its very detailed, making killing cops and hi-jacking cars just that much funner. The storyline was also great. The sound in this game was also fun, very realistic but il really cut to the chase, the gameplay. In GTA we all love just to roam around, killing cops, hi-jacking cars, speeding on the highway, riding helecopters and running from the cops, hell, iv spent hundreds of hours playing San Andreas and still havnet beat the storyline =S. GTA 4 dose that all and makes it much funner. You just cant desribe all you can do and im not going to make a 9000 word essay describing it because my opinion is probably different than yours. My advice, Gamespots Advice, IGNs Advice, its a great game and if you like games like this, you should give it a tryMy rating scale depends on the platform and genre its on. Since PC has much more awesome games on it, i mark much harder on it so a 80% on PC would mean its great compared to the hundreds of other awesome PC games of that genre, and might be better than a 98% of consoles. A great game is a great game, on the system.I like to keep my reviews short and sweet, so i wont bore you and get to the point.

       "  'description': 'I recently replayed Half Life 2 to make sure I had all of my lore in line when tackling the second episode. Although this was my third play through and there were no more surprises, the game still holds up well and delivers a thoroughly enjoyable game play experience. The game can do this a few years after its first release by pioneering many new concepts and additions in the first person shooter genre. Concepts that were refined in the subsequent episodes. These include the lip syncing technology, physics based puzzles, vehicle based combat (although this was done outside the series) and of course some innovative weapons additions. The standout weapon of course being Gravity Gun and all the puzzle solving and creative killing opportunities it presents. Nothing is more satisfying than lining 3 or four zombies and letting rip with a saw blade. It is a pity that achievements were not retrofitted into the first game and episode for the Orange Box on PC, as these would have provided opportunities for some interesting achievements. The only real criticisms I can level at the game are unevenness in the graphical quality, with a few blurry low-res textures here and there and the lack of any multi-player with the initial release. As somebody who always places a well designed single player experience first however, I highly recommend Half Life 2. It continues the good work of its landmark predecessor and improves both the story and game play experience in ways that help it stay the course as the benchmark FPS on the PC. ',\n",

       "  'description': 'Not many shows today have become runaway hits, but one that has is 24. The series is known for its somewhat realistic stories and gripping action. Featuring a diverse cast of characters and plots, the show is able to pull its audience into the world of espionage and terrorism. 24 has changed the way TV shows are looked at and now it’s moving on to a new medium. The series is trying to bring its intense story and action to the Playstation 2 in the form of 24: The Game. The game is developed by Sony Cambridge (Primal, Ghosthunter) and published by 2K games. While 24: The Game manages to bring the elements that made the show successful, but that’s not saying the game is of the same quality.Story is one of the most important aspects of 24 and the game does an admirable job of presenting a new plot in the 24 universe. The game takes place between seasons two and three. This answers some questions that were left unanswered such as how Chase Edmunds became Jack’s partner and how President Palmer recovered from the attempt on his life. All the main characters from the show such as Tony, Michelle, Kim, and President David Palmer all make appearances. The appearances of characters like President Palmer and Michelle will make fans happy since they are not on the current season of the show. The plot of the game revolves around an assassination attempt on the vice president. Your mission is to stop this from happening while uncovering further conspiracies. The overall story is solid but it’s the way that it’s told which the weak part is. The one thing that is lacking the most is the intensity that is found in the show. While the performances are solid the game just seems to be missing that edge found in the show. The length of the cinemas is also a disappointing aspect. Fans of the show probably would have loved for long MGS style sequences to flesh out the story but sadly you don’t get that. The average length of a cutscene is under three minutes so it doesn’t establish the drama that is found in the show. The cutscenes also establish the upcoming mission too obviously. There will be a cutscene showing a bomb and of course you need to defuse it in the next mission. The story while well written, but is just executed the wrong way.24 is known for its unique presentation, primarily the multiple camera panels. This camera style fits the game perfectly for the cinema sequences. It is also used in the actual gameplay but it doesn’t necessarily make the game any better. The technique is best used when showing upcoming threats or clues but it’s a bit disorienting when you enter a door and a new panel pops up. The other elements 24 are known for, such as its acting and music, is in full force in the game. All the actors provide good performances that are on par with their screen work. The new actors brought in are top notch and fit perfectly with the game. 24 also provides one of the last performances of the late actor Andreas Katsulas, best known for portraying G’Kar on the show Babylon 5. The music is composed by the series composer Sean Callery, and uses existing themes from the show while providing new themes. The music definitely adds to the experience and will get fans pumped up for the action scenesOne thing the game manages to do is accurately depict the characters. The character models resemble the real world counterparts to an amazing degree. The accurate depiction of the actors is definitely the games highest achievement in terms of graphics. Not much can be said for the rest of the games graphical presentation. Sony Cambridge used an enhanced version of the Primal engine but certain problems that were apparent in Primal have not been addressed. One of the main problems is the characters faces. While they look good, they don’t emote that much and the lip synching is off. The faces look a bit stiff so in a way the character models are good looking mannequins. The environments feature both destructible and moveable objects, but for the most part everything is bland. There isn’t a lot of detail littered throughout the levels so you may grow tired of walking through bland environments. Both the character models and environments suffer from obvious texture stitching. Seeing the seam of Jack Bauer’s jacket may take some out of the experience.While the show has its fair share of action translating this to a game works at times but falters at other points. The controls in theory sound good but don’t control that well. To aim you press L1 and you fire with R1. When you aim the camera goes into a Resident Evil 4 behind the shoulder view. This is good concept but it seems the camera is zoomed in too close so it’s difficult to view more than 1 enemy. It’s also a bit difficult to target enemies. Targeting is done via flicking the right analog stick. Many games have tried flick targeting and 24 doesn’t do it any better. The system just feels loose and flicking the right stick during the heat of battle can be problematic. Driving is also heavily featured in the game, but doesn’t control any better than the shooting. The vehicle controls feel very loose and unresponsive. These control issues can cause problems in some of the harder vehicle missions such as evading police. The one element that is done best in the game is the interrogations. Not only are these easy to control, they’re fun to play and best capture the essence of the show. During these missions you use different techniques to break the enemy’s mental state. You may go soft at first, but you may go up in their face demanding for information which may lead to you pressing your gun against their head. These scenes are well directed and provide some of the best moments in the game. There are also various mini-games throughout the main levels. These range from defusing bombs, analyzing satellite info, or tracking something down. These sequences are short and easy to play but are fairly predictable. They are pretty basic throughout the game and the difficulty only changes through the amount of time you have.Another aspect that 24 is known for is for presenting every episode in real time. The real time element of the show has quickly become one of its trademarks. Sadly the game doesn’t have any real time functionality. As you progress through the game you don’t get a sense that you are going through the day hour by hour which is one of the key parts of the show. The first “hour” of the game can easily be completed in around fourteen minutes. The only indication that you’re entering a new hour is by an indication on the screen. It just doesn’t feel right when you’ve complete 2 hours in the games story in 1 hour of game play. The levels themselves are rather straightforward and there are a few which have time limits. These time limits help give the game a sense of time since the game isn’t in real-time. The overall difficulty of the game is fine but there are a few missions, especially some of the driving levels, which will have you playing the same hour over and over again until you pass it. This may get a bit tedious to some since the flow of the game is stopped to a complete halt.The game has its fair share of flaws which may only make the game appealing to fans of the show. Fans are definitely going to be excited to play as Jack Bauer but the average game player may not find it all appealing. The story of the game is accessible to people unfamiliar to the show but chances are they may not appreciate the story as much as the fans. Even the fans of the show may be disappointed with the games levels and story. If you’re a hardcore fan of the show, the game is a buy since it only retails for $39.99. Everyone else who may not be familiar with the show should rent 24 and see if they’re willing to invest the time. 24 is one of the most appealing and action packed shows on TV today but the game only cracks the surface of what it could have been.',\n",

       "  'description': 'With the Gamecube far behind us and the Wii\\'s problems with playing import games, you may be wondering if it\\'s worth your time importing this game. While you may think it boils down to the question\"...how much do I like Yoshie\\'s Cookie?\"....there are several other features that make this package triple A material.First of all, the graphical presentation is top notch. Everything is 2D sprites, but it all looks extremely vibrant and colorful. Each game seems to have it\\'s own unique art style, which really goes a long way to make you feel as if you are playing three very different games. Dr. Mario has a sort of Paper Mario presentation to it, Yoshie\\'s Cookie has a Yoshie\\'s Story art style. Panel de Pon is definately the most unique art style of the three games and consists of young super deformed anime girls. Obviously here, Nintendo was trying to appeal to a younger female demographic. The music and sound effects are all fitting to the themes of the games.Eah game has a story mode, which is a nice diversion from bare bones vs computer play, but unless you have a fairly good understanding of Japanese, you\\'re not going to find much here that will entertain you. The matches in story mode against various characters are interesting, but can become a bit repetative after some time.One of the best featues of this package are the multiplayer options. Each game has a 4 player vs mode and this is where Puzzle Collection really shines. The 4 player gameplay is one of the most enjoyable multiplayer experiences to be had on the Gamecube, and there are plenty of options to make it enjoyable for players of all skill levels.This game also has best use of GBA to Gamecube connectivity that I have ever seen. Basically, you simply download the games into your GBA and play them for as long as your batteries can last, or you switch off the system. Unfortunately, there is no way to transfer your high scores back to the Gamecube. While Dr. Mario and Yoshie\\'s Cookie look like the NES version of these games, Panel de Pon doesn\\'t look very much diferent than it\\'s Gamecube counterpart. While it can be time consuming and a little troublesome to hook your GBA to your Gamecube, it is a great way to practice anytime, anywhere for any upcoming 4 player matches you may be planning.Some other features include a 3D mode in Panel de Pon and the training mode in Dr. Mario. The training mode in Dr. Mario is more in depth than the simple tutorials of the other two games, providing advanced strategies and helpful tips. The 3D mode in Panel de Pon has you turning a cylinder full of blocks, having you keep track of far more blocks than the 2D mode as the cylinder fills up. At first this comes across as quite gimmicky, but it\\'s actually a nice feature if you are looking for a new twist on the\\xa0familiar gameplay mechanics.Puzzle Collection isn\\'t without it\\'s problems, but almost all of these problems stem from the fact that it\\'s an imported game. The text in Yoshie\\'s Cookie is displayed as incoherent garbage on American systems, so it\\'s difficult to understand the full potential of the modes. Also, it will lock up once in a while due to the fact that it\\'s an import. These are minor quibbles.If 4 player multiplayer, Yoshie\\'s Cookie and Gameboy connectivity are things you can live without, then you might want to go for the GBA version of Dr. Mario/Tetris Attack (Panel de Pon). If you decide to take the risk of importing it you will most likely be very happy with this game. It is the best puzzle game on the Gamecube, and perhaps the best puzzle game of it\\'s hardware generation.',\n",

       "  'description': \"In the months upto release, Crackdown was touted as the successor to GTA's throne, a GTA killer if you will. Gloriously colourful and vibrant screenshots, action packed, fast paced video's. The leadup to this game was huge. And combined with the promise of a Halo3 beta entry, this game looked set to rock every action fans world.And you know what....It did.Crackdown takes place on the fictional futuristic, inter-connected island metropolis of Pacific City, set far out to sea. The stage was set for a paradise for its citizens. However, this dream was all but ended with the growth of 3 powerful gangs; Los Muertos, the Volk, and the Shai Gen corporation. WIth the dream of peace in tatters for the citizens, the lone police force, dubbed the Agency, unleashed their secret weapon upon the unsuspecting gangs - You. In Crackdown you play as a genetically enhanced, heavily modified, super cop. Armed with phenomenal strength, super hero agility, several bulletproof vehicles and an armoury that the SAS would be envious of, you are set loose on Pacific City with the goal of eliminating the leaders of the 3 gangs, thus bringing peace to the local populace. The game incorporates RPG elements, utilising 5 skills; driving, agility, strength, shooting and explosives. At the beginning of the game, you are not much more powerful than your average human. But as your time with the game progresses, you will become unfathomably powerful. Whilst this element is limited, it does add a new dimension to how you want to take out the gang members. Do you concentrate of shooting, which leads to an increase in accuracy, or do you wish to concentrate on running ur enemies down throught the use of the numerous vehicles in the game? \\xa0Now, it must be said that words cannot begin to describe, the thrill of weilding the fully leveled up superpowers. Picking up a truck and hurtling it at your enemies is an experience not yet seen in gaming (and is obviously an effective way of killing gang members). However, these abilities arent just for show. Being able to jump 8 times the height of a normal human being, gives the sandbox genre a new dimension. No longer are you limited to the streets, when you have the ability to climb even the tallest skyscrapers. As I said, this opens up brand new tactical options for taking down gang leaders. A good example is the mission to take down the Los Muertos kingpin (the head honcho if you will), wholed up on a seemingly inpenetrable island fortress. But as daunting as this would be in say GTA, Crackdowns superhero abilities give you several ways to break in and kill the kingpin. You could for example drive a truck armed with mines straight through the front gate, blowing the guards apart. Or you could swim round the defences and stealthily climb the rocks to reach your foe. Or maybe sitting back and sniping everyone from afar is your style. Of course is there is simply the option to jump walk into the fortress, guns and rocket launchers blazing. But as is clear, there are many, many ways to accomplish your goals in Crackdown.However, due to the number of ways of accomplishing objectives, this does make the game rather easy. This easiness is increased by the Regenerating Health System (as seen in every FPS under the sun). This also makes the game out to be quite short, with most competent agents being able to blow through all 21 gang generals and kingpins in under 8 hours. Although, the completionists among you will spend countless more hours with the game, hunting down the game's 500 agility orbs.Also featured in the game are time trial modes, designed to test your agility, driving and killing capabilities. These also feature xbox live leaderboards, giving it some replay value after you are finished with the main story.The game does support a very enjoyable co-op mode, via both system link and xbox live. This naturally increases the time you'll spend with the game, providing you have another rocket launcher trigger happy friend to play along with you. The game also supports downloadable content in the form of weapon packs. This may give you some more enjoyment with the game, depending on whether you are prepared to spend microsoft points on them.All in all though, Crackdown's quirks and shortness are outweighed by the game's many innovations, and thus, this new take on the sandbox genre is a must play for any action or GTA fan.\",\n",

       "  'description': '\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 When first playing Burnout Paradise it may seem like the developer, Criterion Games, decided to abandon the old Burnout formula and attempt to take the series into uncharted waters by giving the player an entire city to race, and more likely crash, through. Then after the first few hours it becomes clear that that change was probably for the better. Paradise City will be fairly difficult to navigate at first, but as soon as you learn where the finish lines are located and the fastest routes to get to them the game becomes extremely fun. Even searching for the collectibles (i.e. jumps, gates, and billboards) have been made more enjoyable due to the fact that many require you to preform some kind jump or other maneuver in order to get to them. It is equally exciting when you can string multiple jumps, billboards, and gate-smashes together. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Starting out in Paradise City is pretty simple, you get a low-level car and a learner\\'s permit and are told to accumulate enough wins to get to the next license. To unlock more powerful cars, you must win events and then takedown the cars as they cruise the streets of Paradise. You only have to get a couple wins to get your first license, but as you progress through the game it takes more and more wins to graduate to the next license as each event becomes increasingly more difficult. There are fives types of events scattered around the city, all of which can be completed in any order and (if won) are added to your license. One of the first events you will probably want to try is a race, but unlike Burnout games of the past you aren\\'t given a specific track to race through. Instead you are told to race to one of the eight points on the map that are designated as \"finish lines\". The route you take to the finish is totally up to you, though I will say that following the other cars isn\\'t always the best option. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Another racing-type event is Marked Man, in which you must get to one of the finish lines before your vehicle is destroyed by a group of pursuing sports cars. Just like races, you must find the fastest way to the given finish line to win. The last \\'get from A to B\\' event is a Burning Route, which is this game\\'s version of a time trial. Each time you get a new car it unlocks a Burning Route for that vehicle, where you must get from start to finish in a given amount of time. If you win you are rewarded with a sometimes better version of that car. I say \"sometimes\" because I have found that in some cases the original is better. One of the more challenging events is Stunt Run, where you must score a set number of points before time runs out. Points are awarded for drifts, jumps, boosting, spins, and barrel rolls while multipliers are given for airtime, smashing through billboards, and most of the stunts previously mentioned.  \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The last of the five events, and by far my most favorite, is Road Rage. Road Rage events are similar to those in Burnouts of the past, but there are a few key differences. For one thing it can become very easy to get an incredible amount of takedowns if you can manage to repair your car before it gets totaled. Another difference is that because you have an entire city at your disposal, it is wise that you plan routes to take so you can do maximum damage. Getting 50-60 takedowns an event is quite possible with just a little planning. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Now that I\\'ve talked about the ways to get awesome cars, what better way to show off your awesomeness then to smash your beautiful car into someone else\\'s beautiful car online! The online portion of Burnout Paradise is one of the more thrilling experiences I\\'ve had over the internet. Of course you have your ranked and unranked races, but there\\'s also Freeburn Online, where you and up to seven other people can roam around the city and crash into each other, set up races, and complete online challenges. Teamwork is a big factor when trying to complete challenges since it requires the cooperation of everyone playing, so having a headset is a plus. One interesting feature is the way camera support is used in the game. Not only is the camera used for your license photo, but every time you win a race or are taken down by another player it takes a snapshot for everyone else to see. As of this post I thankfully have not received any pictures of someones \\'privates\\', and hopefully it stays that way.  \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 As I\\'m sure everyone knows, everything has its good and bad. Sadly Burnout Paradise has a few problems that should be discussed. First whenever you are in an off-line event and you lose, there isn\\'t any kind of retry feature which means that if you want to try the same event again you must drive all the way back to the start. This can become quite frustrating when you try to get your Burnout Elite license since you have to win every event in the city. Another problem I\\'ve had is with the camera being set too low behind some cars. In smaller cars the camera is set so low you sometimes can\\'t see if there is a car in front of you. It is really more of an annoyance than anything else. At times the online play can be annoying as well. As I said earlier a headset is a big plus because some challenges require communication between players. I\\'ve been in a few games where our party could not complete a challenge because one player couldn\\'t hear us or just didn\\'t care. Also if someone quits during a challenge it is canceled, which can also be frustrating since certain objectives require a certain number of players.  \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 All in all Burnout Paradise is an incredibly fun and exciting racing game, though a few problems could sadly turn some people away. Even though they aren\\'t huge problems, they may become enough of a hindrance that a select few might want to put the controller down and try something else.',\n",

       "  'description': 'The Burnout series has pretty much been the same since the beginning with slight changes and graphical updates. In my opinion i think Burnout Paradise is the best of the series. Many games have tried the open world concept, and most of them have failed. Burnout successfully tackles the open world concept. If you played other burnout games you will be familiar with this one even though it can get confusing and annoying at times. You start out the game with a junker and have to go to the repair shop to repair it and get racing. To start out events you must got to any stop-light and preform a burnout by pressing L2+R2 and the events include all the Burnout classics including the following: Race, Road Rage and others. In a review for a game with no story i cant think of much to say. To play burnout online is a seamless experience by pressing LEFT on the d-pad you get to choose from you friends and other things like freeburn. There are no menus to go through to get to any of the game and there are no loading times to get to online or the other side of the map. The bad thing about burnout is that when you finish or fail an event you dont go to the start you end up where you end up. The navigation in burnout suck to say the least. In the time I\\'ve played it it darn near impossible to get to your starting point if you want to but its fun just to driving arround find events and doing them, but the bad thing is to get new cars you need to go the the junkyard which is a pain in the ass to find while your driving arround. Thats just me some of you might be good at that kind of thing. The online aspect of burnout is cool. It\\'s a seemless transfer form offline to online, it has online leader boards for every street in the game and has 50 challenges for 2 players 50 for 3 and so on. In the multi-player portion of the game there are 350 challenges to be completed and best completed with your personal friends or mature clan-mates, beacuse it take concentration and cooperation to complete the challenges. This is my first game purchase of 2008 and i could have thought of a better game to buy. If you a fan of the burnout series and have 60$ to spend get this game.In the recent update (Cagney) which was released July 10th and added custom sound tracks for the ps3 version.Here is a list strait from Criterion of all the added features.\"3 New Freeburn Game Modes: • Road Rage Up to 8-player team event.

       "  'description': \"Have you ever wondered what it would be like exploring the mind of a lungfish? Me neither, but now you can with Psychonauts. Long in development, Psychonauts follows Raz as he breaks into a summer camp for psychic soldiers, or psychonauts. It doesn’t take long for things to get out of control and an evil force has kidnapped all of the brains from the campers. It is your job to get things back to normal at the camp, and you do so by exploring a series of brains, each unique and each having a crazy style. For instance, when you go inside your tough-guy coach’s brain, it has a war theme. When you progress through the game you can’t wait until you get to see what the next brain is like since each is so wildly different from the previous one.  Of course you won’t have to travel through the world of Psychonauts without some awesome psychic powers. This game features many of them, and they range from telekinesis to confusion grenades. You can assign three of the powers to your shoulder buttons, and you can switch between them quite easily. These powers are used often to solve puzzles and get to new areas in a brain. Aside from the psychic powers you have your standard punch and double jump abilities, each using a cool mental effect.  Each level has many collectibles scattered through it, so you will have plenty to do. There is emotional baggage (looks like an actual bag) that you have to find tags for, mental cobwebs, and figments of imagination (also using a cool 2D graphic) to keep you occupied.  Psychonauts controls like a platformer should, and I noticed hardly any problems with the control scheme. The camera isn’t a problem, either. Placing the psychic powers in the shoulder buttons works perfectly, allowing you to use them easily. Overall, there were no big problems with controls.  One of the strong points in Psychonauts is the voice acting. It is near-perfect, and each line of dialogue is hilarious. One of my favorite lines from the game was from the counselor telling you that you were “as fast as greasy lightning!” There are a wide variety of characters in Psychonauts giving the voice actors plenty to work with. With an original soundtrack, he music in Psychonauts is also well done.  The graphics in Psychonauts are also very well done. The cut scenes are pre-rendered and pretty. In game, the graphics are colorful and beautiful, creating a unique environment for the game.\\xa0 Although the Xbox version looks a bit nicer, you won't find any major problems in the PlayStation 2 port.  I completed Psychonauts in about 14 hours, but that includes more than three hours of mindless arrowhead (the game’s currency) hunting when I could have just bought the deep arrowhead finder and completed the task in 15 minutes. The average person could easily complete Psychonauts at a normal pace in about 11 hours. It isn’t very long, but it is fun while it lasts. The game runs for about only $30 right now (if you can find it), so it still is a great value.  Psychonauts is a easy game. You will have no problems beating most of the boss battles in your first time and I went the entire game with getting only one “game over” due to a somewhat challenging platforming challenge. Its difficulty doesn’t get in the way of the game, however. It is still surprisingly fun despite its lack of challenge.  Psychonauts is an excellent game that should not be missed. The game is perhaps one of the funniest games released this console generation. Psychonauts is also unique title, being one of the most innovative titles in years. Unfortunately, this game was avoided by many, so it may be hard to find the game, but if you can find it, Psychonauts will be one of the best games you will play in years. Don’t miss out on this incredible game.\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'Does Black live up to the title \"Gun Porn\"?',\n",
       "  'description': 'Over the years First Person Shooting games have quickly become one of the most popular and established genres in the game industry. The genre first gained popularity on the PC in the early nineties with games like Doom, Castle Wolfenstein and Duke Nukem. Fps games then moved to the home console with the likes of Goldeneye, Medal of Honor and Halo. While some titles are sci-fi or historically based, they are all the same. Swap out the weapons and settings and you have the same core gameplay. This has plagued the industry since some games have no character or present nothing new. Well this changes with Criterion’s Black. Best known for their Burnout racing games, Criterion is now tackling the fps genre. But can Criterion pull off same magic they did with the racing genre with fps games?The story of Black is like that of any Hollywood action flick. You play as a Black Operative, named Keller, in an organization so secretive that even the president doesn’t know it exists. Your job is to fix the mistakes of missions gone awry and save the world from disasters that they didn’t know of. The latest mission sends you to Europe to go after a rogue Black Op who is now with a terrorist cell called 7th Wave. Your mission doesn’t go as planned and you find yourself arrested and being interrogated by your own people. The game starts with Keller being interrogated as he tells his interrogator what exactly happened. The story is actually told through live action cutscenes instead of prerendered cinemas. Now some may be worried about this since the track record of fmv’s hasn’t been that good as of late (e.g. Marvel Nemesis, Need For Speed: Most Wanted). The cut scene’s are actually very stylish and have high production value. There are nice filter and editing effects used which convey the seriousness of the situation. The look of the cut scenes is similar to a Tony Scott film or TV shows like 24 and Alias. The use of live action actually is more engaging since it’s like you’re watching a high quality film or TV show and then you get to play the good parts. The story is pretty easy to follow, but don’t be expecting much of a resolution as the game leaves the door open for a sequel. Black has the same core philosophy as Burnout, provide Hollywood style action and make it fun to play. Criterion’s love of action films is more evident that it was in the Burnout games. Several parts of the game clearly have inspiration from films like The Matrix, The Rock and Die Hard. The core gameplay of Black is simple, you go to areas and shoot bad guys but the unique thing about the game is how you go about obliterating them. Unlike other fps games where the environment is not fully interactive, Black for the most part, provides a truly interactive experience. If you see a truck and say to yourself, “Hey I wonder if I can blow that truck up and take out some enemies”, well you can and much more. You can also shoot through walls, ricochet bullets off hard surfaces, and take out entire buildings. Yes, you can equip a rocket launcher and take out a good portion if not all, of a building, good times are ahead. Those who are veterans of the fps genre may find Black similar to 2001’s Red Fraction. Red Fraction was the first title to feature heavily destructible environments, but Black takes it to the next level. While Black doesn’t allow you to damage every surface, it provides a deeper and more satisfying experience than Red Faction The amount of destruction that you and your enemies are capable of is simply staggering. During firefights debris is flying, cars are exploding and bodies are flying, it’s simply amazing. The intensity that the game provides is truly unique and immerses you into the game. Firefights will often have so much debris flying that it’s hard to see things. This leads to some confusion but in a good way since you don’t know what’s coming up next. Due to the intensity of battles you will often find yourself hiding behind cover. But what do you do when your cover has been shot up with bullets? Well you can simply blow up the enemies cover and then kill them. Or you can shoot a canister hanging from the ceiling and watch your foes burst into flames. The possibilities of destruction in Black are endless. Unlike other games, the destruction doesn’t feel scripted; everything flows naturally because you have the freedom to destroy what you want. If you want to blow up the barrel under the bridge you can, or you could just snipe the enemy. If you see a door you could walk up to it and open it the old fashion way, or you could equip your shotgun, blow the door of its hinges and catch an enemy unawares. Now some may think that the interactivity is a gimmick but it really isn’t. The game provides what would happen if you really had a gun of immense power and was going on a rampage. Shooting stuff up good doesn’t get old thanks in part to different scenarios and your fabulous guns.The star of the game is the weapons. The amount of time and detail gone into designing these weapons is amazing. Black’s guns are like the cars in Gran Turismo, they’re so beautiful that you’ll just want to stare at them. Weapons in the game include a pistol, rocket launcher, AK-47, revolver, shotgun, and grenades. Each weapon resembles their real world counterpart with a few aesthetic details added. Some guns make have a few ridges or grooves on them which allow dynamic lighting on the guns. This adds some character to the weapons since each one will visually look different. The thing Black does that some fps games have failed is that it feels like you are actually shooting the guns. If you shoot the revolver at someone you’ll see their body fly back 8 feet. Using the AK-47 on an enemy will result in their body moving in a violent dance of death. The shooting and reloading animations are simply fantastic. Rest assured though that the animations aren’t long and complex like in Killzone. Black actually does something different with their reload animations that’s never been done before. Whenever you reload the foreground becomes blurred out while your weapon is in focus. This technique is used to convey the importance of reloading during battle. The blurred effect look is very convincing and successfully pulls off what Criterion was going for. This effect also establishes a chance for the player to appreciate how detailed the guns have been modeled. Black by far features some of the best bullets ever seen in a game. Never before have bullets look so convincing both when exiting and entering a gun. When you reload your revolver you’ll see the seven silver bullets in your clip glisten in the sunlight. The total number of guns you can carry is two. This may feel limiting at first but after awhile you’ll get used to it. The limited gun options also add a small dose of strategy since you’ll have to decide whether you should drop your AK for the Shotgun. When it comes to guns, Black provides true bliss for those enthusiasts out there.Black has a diverse range of settings. Levels range from city streets, industrial areas, forests, and a graveyard. The way Black places the order of these areas is the interesting thing. In one level you’ll be in a city blowing up buildings but then in the next you’ll be in a forest trying to cross the border. This change of settings is a good way to keep things varied so you don’t grow tired of playing in the same style of environment. It also changes the pace of the game since some levels are all out action but others are mellower. The different environments also provide different things to destroy since you won’t be blowing up cars in the forest level. This helps to keep the game from being monotonous and keeps things fresh. The levels themselves are quite linear so you’ll be following the path the game wants you to. There is only one level where there is more than one path for you to take.The Burnout series is known for its visual prowess and Criterion pulls it off in Black. The visuals are sharp and amazing for the PS2 hardware. There is no aliasing and hardly any slowdown which is surprising considering the action happening. The locales are loaded with detailed and unique production design. The city level actually looks like a war torn European country such as Kosovo, complete with dilapidated buildings etched with bullet holes. Each setting has its own color palette so the player won’t grow bored of seeing the same industrial tones. The locales are further enhanced by dynamic lighting and explosions. The explosions are detailed and have a nice movie look to them similar to the truck scene from The Matrix Reloaded. There are also nice visual effects such as motion blur and blooming. Particle effects are also a key effect in Black. The amounts of particles on screen whether its dirt, sparks, or splintering wood is quite a visual treat. The particles help immerse the player in the game since it’s a key factor to the power of the guns. Black also has some amazing smoke trails from the rocket launchers. The shape and density of the smoke almost looks like an effect from a next gen title. Character models are nicely detailed and varied. Soldiers have different uniforms ranging from camouflage and swat gear. After shooting an enemy a piece from the soldier’s uniform will fall off. This is a nice effect but it would have been nice if there was a bit more damage modeling to the characters. The death animations are done quite effectively and are further enhanced by rag doll physics which help sell the power of the guns. You will be truly be convinced after you see an enemy move in pain and then slump over a railing and plummet to the ground.One of the most important aspects of fps games and any games for that matter is the enemy A.I. If you have no competition then you may not enjoy the game, but if the enemies are too hard then you won’t be having a good time. Finding the delicate balance between fun and skill is hard thing to do. Black for the most part finds the finds this balance, but at times is too easy. Enemies will find cover and will mow you down if you’re reckless but they don’t reach the level of intelligence as found in titles such as F.E.A.R. Enemies won’t notice anything after you’ve shot the comrade that was standing next to them, which makes the game a bit easy. There are times when the enemies will just stand there waiting for you to shoot at them which makes them easy targets. There are four classes of enemies to keep the action varied. Each class has different weapons and armor, which helps keep the game from being repetitive since you won’t be seeing the same foes with the same weapons. In certain missions you are accompanied by squad mates. These characters help the immersion and feel of the game since they’re shouting at you but for the most part that’s all they’re good for. Your allies aren’t the best marksmen and you can’t give any commands to help the situation. Most of the time your comrades will be running along you and firing at nothing. One good thing is that your squad mates don’t physically get in your way, so you don’t need to worry about being blocked in an area. Criterion immersed players with the audio in Burnout and they do it once again ten fold in Black. First off, the game is best played with a 5.1 sound system. Playing Black without a sound system is like playing the XBOX 360 on a standard definition TV, you will still have fun playing the game but you won’t be getting the full experience. The sound design in the game conveys that you’re on some battlefield with mayhem surrounding you. Explosions sound massive and will give you that “Oh my god” feeling. The guns are loud and sound violent just like in real life. The blast of your shotgun sounds like a bomb being dropped on whatever you’re pointing at. Hearing bullets whizzing by barely missing you adds to the immersion and intensity of the game. The game also has a lot of enemy voice over. Hearing loud angry foreign voices will pump you up and scare you at the same time since you don’t know what’s coming next. The in game chatter between you and your squad mates is well acted and doesn’t get annoying. The score for Black is also exceptional. The score is composed by Michael Giacchino, best known for his work in the Medal of Honor series and film and TV work such as The Incredibles, Lost and Alias. The score is all orchestral and is on par with any Hollywood score and Mr. Giacchino’s previous work. There is a nice espionage like theme in the game but the music is only really noticeable in the non action parts of the game.The controls for Black are quite sharp. Moving your gun is easy and feels like there is some weight to it. Black doesn’t give the player the option to change the sensitivity of the controls, so that may disappoint players who like to tinker with the settings. There is also no sprint action in the game so you can’t go on a full speed rampage. The lack of the sprint buttons sometimes makes the pace of the game a tad bit slow. Black also lacks a jump button. While this is not necessarily important, it does make the game feel a bit confining. Black does get the important aspect of having the analog movement being tight and not loose like some titles. One of the problems with Black is its length. When playing on the preset difficulty, the game can be finished in about 8 hour or less. There is a harder difficulty unlocked once you finish the game but it really isn’t that much of a difference. There are a few bonuses such as silver plated weapons but nothing that special. The only reason for going back to the game would be to let off some steam or to master a level. Black also has no multiplayer modes, both online and off, which hampers its replay factor. Multiplayer modes are usually one of the most popular aspects of fps games, so the hardcore players are surely to be disappointed. Another issue with the game is that sometimes the game gets a bit tedious and easy. When you constantly go around shooting guys who just happen to be standing next to an explosive barrel, things may get a bit old. There also isn’t a lot of variety in the missions. Basically the goal of each mission is to take out all the enemies and sometimes you’ve given the task of blowing up a particular structure. While it’s still entertaining, Black is best played in multiple sessions. Overall, Black presents an enjoyable and well polished experience. The game focuses on the important aspects of an fps game instead of trivial things like being able to throw garbage at guards. The time and effort gone into designing the guns and environments is evident and immerses the player into the world Criterion created. The game has a few flaws like questionable A.I, lack of mission variety, and despite lacking any form of multiplayer modes and short play time, the game is still enjoyable. Black is a fun game for action fans who always wanted to be their own Rambo or Harry Tasker. Black gives the player the chance to live in their own Hollywood action film and it’s an opportunity that shouldn’t be missed.',\n",

       " {'deck': 'One Of The Best Examples Of How To Use NES Hardware: Contra',\n",
       "  'description': \" If you're a European gamer, you'll know this as Probotector, but don't let that stop you from getting this game. What you see here is the best example of how the use the NES' hardware. Although Contra is weaker on the NES compared to it's arcade brother, Contra on NES is probably one of the most visually outstanding Nintendo games ever. From the minute you start the game, you'll know this game is different. For starters, there are far more enemies on the screen at once compared to other NES games, but even more special is just how\\xa0much activity\\xa0is coming from those enemies and with little slowdown. The animation, the scrolling and general movement of the game also remains smooth at an incredibly fast rate - projectiles fly everywhere and there is even a psuedo 3D look to some of the later levels, which is pretty cool. To top it off, the levels themselves are very detailed and despite the game running on weaker hardware, like I mentioned earlier, the game stays very true to the arcade original. The music is also incredibly impressive on Contra. The music pumps pure adrenaline into your veins and will keep you going through out. Although the bleeps may sound primitive now, they suit well to the general feeling of the game and it probably won't bother you never the less. However non of that compares to the intense gameplay Contra is well known for. Despite the beauty of both the sound and cosmetics of Contra, you won't be able to give yourself a second to enjoy them just because of how intensive the action itself actually is. It's addictive and simple, however works incredibly well thanks to how tight and well designed the game's controls are adapted to the NES' notoriously uncomfortable controller.\\xa0A warning however, this game is hard, seriously hard and may lead to fustrations. The sidescrolling killing and dodging aspect of Contra plays as a double edged sword. At first it will seem unfair to players how difficult the game actually is. However, play this right, and you'll probably be having some of the most fun moments ever on your NES. However despite this, the game is still cheap and incredibly unfair at moments. Another issue is how long the game is itself. Although, you can't accept a seriously long game with an arcade port anyway, there atleast should be some extras to accompany the game to say the least. Infact the ending of the game is also quite poor and you'll be dissapointed at it yourself. However this game does have replay value, regardless of the lack of extras and you'll more than come back to this game over and over again, even if you lose or win the game. Maybe this is the reason the game is hard, but who knows. So to sum it up, you have to play Contra. Sure, the game is hard at first, but the game's that addictive you'll be playing it for months, despite how long the game itself actually is. So for the reasons I mentioned earlier this game is well worth considering, especially since there are very few games like this on NES, or in gaming history at all.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Well i don't know what it is but for some reason i quite like this game, im not a big sports game fan but have always had a soft spot for tennis games but there are a few problems.The first being when you start and create a character it's just i a bit hard to get a hang of and i had to make 2 -3 players until i was happy with it not being a freak, secondley is difficulty i know this game is harder than a normal tennis game, but you seem to hit a wall of not advancing and it just seems like your grinding to get your stats good enough just run a little faster or hit a little harder.Now for the good, Top spin 3 plays very well and the controls feel spot on i really like the feeling of weight and momentum in the player and that you really have to position yourself for a good shoot.The graphics are also very good with very well realized courts and players althought the real players do look a little off with some better than others, but as a complete graphics package you can not fault it.The sound is what you could expect from a tennis game, althought the menu music can get anoying as it keeps changing everytime you change to a different menu and just feels disjointed.I would recommend this game to any tennis fan and anyone looking for a good sports game with excellent controls.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Here is a game in which breathtaking visuals and perhaps the largest free roaming environment in gaming history supplement, but do not by any means overshadow, an equally vast amount of gameplay content.In The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, you take on the role of a citizen of Tamriel. What your character looks like, the skills he or she is proficient in, and how he or she acts, is entirely up to the player.The game has an interesting enough main quest, introduced to you when you first begin playing the game, and this alone should keep you busy running around serving the empire for quite some time. What you\\'ll inevitably find, though, is that you\\'ll early and often get sidetracked by the game\\'s incredible amount of non main quest activities. I cringe to call these activities \"side quests\" because you\\'ll almost certainly spend more time completing these tasks than you will involved in Oblivion\\'s main tale, and that\\'s not a bad thing.You\\'ll be given the chance to become a Gladiator-esque champion of the arena, a warrior type charged with keeping order in the kingdom, a questionably moraled thief working within an underground organization, a heartless and brutal killer serving a dark master in the same vein as Satan himself, among many other roles. This content is not only a welcome addition to the game, but it (perhaps more than any other element) makes the game as great as it is.While excellent in nearly every regard, Oblivion does contain a few small faults. For starters, the physics engine in the game borders on nonsensical. Many times killing someone (or something) with a downward swipe of your weapon will send them flying backwards (...or forwards, or....sideways) through the air, defying any rhyme or reason. Also, the enemies in the game grow more powerful as your character does, so training yourself in the hopes of making your trip through that difficult cave or dungeon a bit easier really won\\'t end up helping you at all. Despite its minor flaws, Oblivion is a game you need to play. It is not only a masterpiece in action RPG gaming, but in gaming in general. Once you finish your playthrough for the first time, you may just want to do it all over again in a different way, and that\\'s just fine.',\n",

       "  'description': 'In 1999, Konami introduced players to the city of Silent Hill. It\\'s your typical Midwest American town, an isolated place, filled with fog and the occasional paranormal activity. The game was a mix between the survival horror genre - established by Resident Evil, with fixed camera perspectives and horribly mutated creatures - and a H.P Lovecraft suspense novel. Two years later, Silent Hill 2 was released for the PlayStation 2, and three months later, for the Xbox and PC, dubbed Restless Dreams - or Inner Fears, in the European version.  James Sunderland finds himself in a rest station in the borders of Silent Hill looking himself on a mirror. What took him to such a place? He received a letter addressed to him, written by his wife. It told him she was waiting for him in their \\'special place\\', in the town of Silent Hill, where they apparently had spent vacation in. The only problem with this letter is that James\\' wife has been dead for three years. With a map in hand, he walks through the endless myst in search of an answer to this riddle. What he finds is a nightmare filled with disturbed characters, hideous creatures and many more questions than anything.  Playing Silent Hill 2 is an exercise of exploration, and less of fighting monsters. Controlling James from a third person view point, you\\'ll run across letters, books and notes containing clues for puzzles, and background information on the denizens of Silent Hill, along with items that can be used as either weapons for defense, like a handgun and a rifle, or for environmental use, like paint thinner. Their use, however, isn\\'t always obvious, which makes finding these vital and a puzzle in itself. The pocket flashlight and static radio both make a comeback, the radio working as a beacon indicating monsters are nearby, and the flashlight, well, lighting the way. Maps can be found for most of the places you\\'ll visit. James will be nice enough to tick off with red ink doors you crossed, or closed off sections that can\\'t be accessed, making it easier to track down the points you\\'ll be running to in order to progress in the game.  Along in your explorations of various Silent Hill landmarks and the streets themselves, far and between, some threats will make their presence known. These creatures, ranging from bizarre mannequins and pyramid head, meat cleave-carrying goons, act as obstacles that most of the times seem psychological than physical barriers to James. Like a classic George A. Romero film, the creatures are the least of the protagonist\\'s worries - the other humans pose more of a threat. You\\'ll quickly meet the cast of unbalanced and disturbed individuals as you make your way through town. The most notable of them is Maria, a woman that shares James\\' wife Mary\\'s looks, but differs personality wise. Sometimes playing the role of partner in certain sections of the game, she\\'s the constant reminder that something is afoot in Silent Hill.  The atmosphere plays its own role in Silent Hill 2. The constant fog and dark sections are gloomy and at the same time inviting. Images are constantly popping on screen in the form of blood on the walls of an apartment building, or a simple rust stain on a door, that wasn\\'t there the first time you stopped to notice. A noise filter, a sort of old home movie grainy screen provides a layer obscuring your view. In this new version of Silent Hill 2, this effect can be turned off, providing cleaner graphics, but taking some of the mood away. The graphical presentation is on par with other Xbox games, and is a bit sharper than the PlayStation 2 version. Characters are detailed nicely, but animated in a rough fashion. The obvious difference in quality between pre-rendered scenes and normal game play is striking enough to notice, with more died out colors and details in these scenes, and more color, with far more sharpness in normal game play. Movement and transition animations look robotic and unnatural. Monsters look gruesome and are disturbing to look at, with fleshy textures. The various locations obviously received a lot of attention, with very well crafted texture work and detail. The level design doesn\\'t stray off the function of the buildings you\\'ll explore, at first glance - for an example, the hotel has halls with rooms and employee area - but present interesting, and dark secrets. Unlike the first Silent Hill, there aren\\'t exactly two versions of the same environments, with a more suspenseful transition that is not as obvious as before.  Not all creepiness is provided by the visuals, however. Ambient noises and the \"boos\" typical of terror films apply to Silent Hill 2. The musical score is limited to tense sections, with very little presence in between. Character voices and performances are mostly delivered in a dry fashion, and have that campiness usually found in direct to video and B/C movies in matinee sessions at early hours on TV.   The main game mode varies in length depending on the difficulty settings. There are two adjustable difficulties, one for combat and another for puzzles. Setting the combat to easy makes enemy encounters even more toned down, while setting the puzzles to hard is to ask for a brain bruiser, with less tips and more complex pieces. On normal difficulties, the adventure is a short one, clocking at around five hours. Different endings can be attained depending on actions taken during the main game, giving it a short replay value. This Xbox version features a second game mode, titled Born from a Wish, that tells a side story with Maria, as she too gets a chance to explore the myst of Silent Hill. Not nearly as long as the main game mode, this second adventure takes around an hour to complete, and acts more like a story in a book\\'s appendix section, showing a bit more of Maria\\'s character background.  Silent Hill 2: Restless Dreams can be compared to a Director\\'s Cut DVD - it doesn\\'t change the overall game with anything strikingly new, the bonus sub section isn\\'t that big of a reason for Silent Hill 2 veterans to explore, but for new comers, it\\'s totally worth the bus fare to Silent Hill.',\n",

       " {'deck': 'The sons of Sparda return in this action masterpiece',\n",
       "  'description': 'Since its release in 2001, the Devil May Cry series has been heralded as one of the premier action titles for the PS2. However, the series was in jeopardy of losing its status when the lackluster Devil May Cry 2 was released in 2003. Thankfully, Capcom redeemed themselves with 2005’s Devil May Cry 3: Dante’s Awakening. The third entry returned to the series’ roots of stylish action and cheesy one liners. However, while fans loved the game, there were some gripes about the difficulty, which was brutally unforgiving. Now nearly a year later Capcom is rewarding its fans with Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition.For those who never played the DMC games before, the story is very easy to understand, so you won’t have to play the previous titles to understand anything. It also helps that DMC 3 is a prequel to DMC 1. Dante and Vergil are the sons of Sparda, a legendary demon warrior who closed the portals to the demonic world. After the death of their mother, Dante and Vergil drew distant and went on different paths. Years later, Vergil sends Dante an invitation to meet him at an ominous tower. The story is further fleshed out through cinemas at the start and end of each level. These sequences provide a good break from the kinetic action found in the levels and are a good way to add dimension to the characters. These scenes also feature some of the craziest action seen in a game. Through the course of the game Dante surfs a rocket and uses a motorcycle as a weapon. The only bad thing about these scenes is that you can’t do the moves that Dante performs in them Capcom has added a slew of things to this title to make it a special edition. The biggest addition is being able to play as Dante’s brother, Vergil. Many fans were disappointed that they couldn’t play as Vergil in DMC 3, as he wielded a katana and was a straight up badass. In order to play as Vergil you need to have either a DMC 3 game save, or you can just finish the Special Edition. Finishing the game is much easier now since Capcom has added an easier difficulty setting. There is also a harder difficulty setting for fans to test their skill against. Starting the game as Vergil begins with a new cinema. This cinema shows how Vergil met Arkham, the other villain in the game. There are sadly no other new cinemas in the game with Vergil. This is somewhat disappointing since it would have been nice to see things from his perspective. Even the cinemas with Dante are not in the game when you play as his brother. Another disappointing aspect is that you fight yourself when you play as Vergil. Instead of adding Dante to the battles where you fought Vergil, Capcom has simply changed the color of Vergil’s jacket from blue to red. This was a missed opportunity since it would have been nice to test your skills against Dante.While Capcom may have disappointed with the cinemas they certainly didn’t with the gameplay. Playing as Vergil is so much different than Dante that players may need to rethink their combat strategies. Instead of guns, Vergil has “Phantom Swords” which are your primary long range weapons. Vergil can summon sword like apparitions and send them towards the enemy. You may not be using the “Phantom Swords” that much since your katana is a very effective weapon. The katana is so large that it’s almost a long range weapon. The katana is also Vergil’s fastest and most powerful weapon. Besides the katana Vergil also has another sword and the Beowulf gauntlets. The gauntlets are hand to hand combat weapons on your arms and feet. These are good to change your attacks up and keep things varied. Vergil doesn’t have as many moves as his brother but he makes up for it in power. Playing the game as Vergil almost seems easy since he defeats foes with ease. This added power makes playing as Vergil fun since you will feel his \"power\" through the moves you perform. One of the pillars of DMC 3’s gameplay was Dante’s different fighting styles. These styles included trickster, gunslinger, royal guard, swordmaster, and doppelganger. At the beginning of each level the player can choose what style they wish to use. As you use a style more you will get experience. There are up to 4 levels of experience per style. Each level of experience will unlock new moves to perform. This adds a slight RPG element to the game since you may have more experience as a gunslinger than a trickster. The style system is a wonderful addition to the game since you can in a way customize the game based on your skill. If you like shooting things you can choose gunslinger, or if you want to stay on the defensive then you can go with royal guard. The one bad thing is that you usually won’t be able to reach the max experience on all the styles by the end of the game. That may disappoint some but it does provide some replay factor. Vergil’s style is “Darkslayer”. While not as elaborate as Dante’s it does have it benefits. Darkslayer allows Vergil to teleport which is good for avoiding attacks and taking on multiple foes.Combat has always been a key aspect of the DMC series and this installment takes it to the next level. The new styles have whole move sets within themselves that are upgraded along with your standard moves. This provides a fresh experience since you can change the styles if you grow tired of certain actions. There are also context sensitive actions with certain weapons. Some players may be turned off by the skilled required to pull off the special moves. While learning the special abilities may be difficult, its worth the time and effort. You will feel satisfied when you you’ve successfully body surf an enemy while shooting those around you. The combat is now much more hectic since you have the option to make the game 20% faster, which certainly makes a difference. Enemies are much quicker when playing on turbo mode so you need to be quick on the draw. Combat still suffers from some odd camera angles which obscure enemies, but not to the same effect as previous installments. Between the levels of non stop action are several puzzles and platform sections. These usually consist of your basic find the key solutions. Another style of puzzle which appears frequently is a light deflection puzzle. This requires Dante to figure out how to direct a beam of light to either a statue or emblem. Figuring out this puzzle is pretty simple and easy to restart if necessary. Like the previous games there are some platform sections. These sections are usually short and don’t appear often. The platforming is slightly hindered by odd camera angles which make jumping difficult.There are sadly no new areas for you to explore as Vergil. You will still make your way through the tower, a belly of a beast and eventually the demonic world. However, there is a new boss for you to fight in the game. The demon clown, Jester, is now a boss. For those fans who wanted to fight this mischievous demon, it’s worth the wait. This battle is by far is one of the best. Just like the other bosses, Jester won’t be a pushover. Like the character, the battle is somewhat humorous as Jester bleeds confetti. The bosses in DMC3 are very over the top, both in design and difficulty. Bosses range from a cerebus, a vampire woman and a demonic horse and carriage. The battles usually require a particular skill or weapon to be victorious. This helps keep the battles different since no two are alike. Several bosses have quite surprising attacks, that if not evaded will do great damage. There is a benefit to toughing it out as you will usually unlock a new weapon after defeating them. Weapons earned from bosses range from elemental swords, a three side nun-chuck and a guitar. Each weapon has a different use, whether it’s for long range or short range combat and a unique power.After you’ve finished the story mode you can enter the Bloody Palace. The Bloody Palace first premiered in DMC 2 and was one of the few positive aspects about that game. The palace consists of 9,999 levels of non-stop action. You will face off against groups of enemies and occasionally bosses. The palace area is a circular so combat can be quite confining. Dante doesn’t regain his health after each level so players need to be at their best to survive. The palace is a very addictive because you’ll want to see how far you can get before dying.The graphics for DMC 3 are some of the best in the industry. Like other Capcom, titles the production values in DMC 3 are top notch and won’t disappoint. The game has some amazing particle effects that are heavily featured in the game. You will also see some impressive motion blur and explosion effects. Character models have a realistic look to them but are still stylized. You will also come across a wide range of enemies which range from scythes, spiders, demonic chess pieces and angels. All the enemies have a unique look to them so you won’t grow tired of seeing the same combatants. As you progress through the tower, you will come across a wide range of areas each with a distinct style. Unlike DMC 2 which featured very drab production design, DMC 3 draws inspiration from DMC 1. The architecture ranges from gothic to more natural designs and even some modern looks. Some elements in the background can be destroyed so the environments don’t feel unnatural. Other parts of the environment, such as poles, are interactive so you can spin around on them while taking down foes. There is some slowdown in the game when the action gets very hectic but it won’t affect your experience.Unlike his brother Dante, Vergil doesn’t talk much. There isn’t a lot of voice over for Vergil during combat but it fits the characters cold demeanor. Dante on the other hand is quite vocal during battle which is conveyed through a taunt button. The voice acting is surprising good and doesn’t feature any cheesy acting. All the actors sound professional and portray their characters effectively. The audio is basically the same as DMC 3. The soundtrack has a strong emphasis on rock music but also has several techno and orchestral pieces. The tracks in the game are varied and there are quite a few of them. This helps since you won’t be listening to the same music all the time. The score is well composed and fits the situation, whether it’s drama or action. The sound effects for the enemies are good and convey their monstrous nature. Having a surround sound system helps since the game supports Dolby Pro Logic II. This provides some amazing sounds especially during battles.Devil May Cry 3 was one of the top action games of last year and the special edition improves it. With the difficulty fixed, finishing the game is not hard and you can actually enjoy playing it. Everything about the game is entertaining- the story, the combat and even the end credits. The addition of new features feel justified and not tacked on. One of the most compelling things about the special edition is its price point of only $20. Whether you have DMC 3 already or not Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition is simply a must for any action fan.',\n",

       "  'description': 'The Call of Duty series has been innovative in the over-played genre and the team behind Call of Duty and Call of Duty 2 has finally learned that the WWII FPS genre is over played and the FPS needed a new spin. So Infinity ward has developed one of the best FPS in recent memory. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and as the subtitle suggests this is not another WWII game is takes place in modern time. Now let\\'s talk about the story. The story in CoD4: MW is all fiction but takes bits and pieces from real world events. You play as two people, one in the British SAS, and another in the Us Marines. You start as a SAS member going through training to get used to the controls and such. Your first real mission is on a ship where highly explosive materials are said to be, and you are sent in there to retrieve them. As soon as you find the materials you find out two MiGS are near the ship and you have to get off as soon as possible so you just grab what you can. This part is most likely the best pat in the game, because soon after you find out that MiGS are on you tail they attack on the ship and you are on a mad rush out of the ship before it sinks.You camera is tilted for added effect and water is rushing in from everywhere and pipes bursting. At the end of the mission you make a leap of faith on to you heli-copter as your captain, Captain Price, save you as you are about to fall.When you are playing as the Marines you are in the Middle East and find out that a key political figure has been assassinated by Khaled Al-Asad, the mastermind you have to stop.Later in to the story you find the SAS and Marines are getting closer and closer together and evetually working together. The marine to play as eventually get killed and from then on out you only play as Soap McTavish,SAS, and last kill of the game is made buy to in a dazed state with a pistol throwen to you but a fellow solider.You as Soap are the only know survior but and Call of Duty fans know Captain Price always come back.All in all the single player is short but good experince with a little bit of replay value with the unlockable arcarde mode where you play the whole story ove again and get points for kills. There are also \"cheats\" for getting enemy intel but nothing to spetactual, until you find all of them and unlock infinite ammo.The single player is just the start of it. The online is where CoD4 shines. The weapons are the best in a game yet, and yes they are just normal weapons but that\\'s what makes them great. Also there is like powerups called perks which you unlock, along with guns and chalenges, by leveling up and XP.The Call of Duty franchise has came a long way since call of duty and this if for the good.

       "  'description': \"While it might not be the most visually stunning 'next-gen' title, EDF offers an experience similar to older skill based shooters. The visuals have a cheesy charm which parallel its low-budget cinematic counterparts. Couple this with equally cheesy dialog and you're in B-Movie wonderland!You play a solider in a typical military squad, and your job is to shoot stuff dead. You'll face giant ants (ala the movie 'Them') giant robots ('War Of The Worlds') and giant dino-mech things (Woo! Godzilla!). The world around you is extremely destructible to the point of absurdity, where a single rocket can bring down an entire skyscraper. You'll navigate the concrete jungle and know your foe's location via a small map in your HUD.The object of each level is the same, kill everything. It's got a very retro feel in its simplicity. In the same way you wouldn't stop playing space invaders until all the bad guys were gone, similarly your objective here is just as simple. What really impresses is the sheer size and number enemies you're expected to dispatch. Also there are a ton of weapons to try, but you'll usually end up falling back on some old standards (machine gun & rocket launcher for example). You'll get vehicles, but they feel a little clunky and despite their firepower can be less useful than being able to roll around and dodge attacks on foot. The audio can become repetitive as there aren't many different 'boom!' sounds, but the dialog of your squad communicating can be endlessly comical.The game can be played co-operatively, but only a couple of levels have any replay value. One frustrating element is when you complete the game on a difficulty, you're awarded Xbox 360's gamer score points, but even if you complete the game on the hardest setting, you won't get any points for the easier difficulties. You'll have the play the whole game again on easy. Also there is no auto save, even if you complete the game. So one memory lapse after a long session could cost you a lot of progress.Despite this the game is just dumb fun. Not a blockbuster, but a pick up and play title that doesn't take itself too seriously. It's great to see these games still being made alongside the big franchises, because there will always be a place for 'brain-in-a-jar let's shoot stuff!' action. As if a lot of big titles aren't just that anyway.Amidst the barrage of hugely popular shooters on the Xbox 360, EDF2017 manages to remain unique because of its loyalty to it's alien invasion / monster movie heritage. While so many games attempt to justify their violence via plots and twists, this is all about shooting aliens. Then shooting bigger aliens. Then shooting even more even bigger aliens.

       " {'deck': 'God of War is bigger, badder and bloodier in this sequel.',\n",
       "  'description': \" God of War II's story starts in the same epic vein as the closing of the previous game. At the end of God of War, Kratos, a Spartan warrior turned into a 'do-it-all' of the gods, claimed his place among them in Olympus as the new god of war. This sequel takes place soon after that, with Kratos becaming more and more bored with his constant conquest through war across all of Greece. Feeling shunned by his fellow gods, he decided to take control of the destruction himself, against the wishes of Olympus. While raiding the city of Rhodes, Kratos has his godly powers stripped from him by the supreme leader of the Olympians, Zeus, and is left for dead on his way to Hades. But Gaya, the Mother Earth, one of the titans, has other plans for the Spartan Ghost. Being saved from death, Kratos thirst for revenge will take him to places all over the mythological world, in an adventure that practically last twice as long as the first God of War.  Fighting, platforming and puzzles are the order of Kratos' journey, following a balanced rhythm that combines the finest elements into a mix of bloody battles that not only require fast reflexes, but quick wits as well. The button combinations that come when enemies suffer are certain amount of damage are back from the original game, with random actions that need to be inputted in order to finish off Kratos' victim in diverse, and mostly gruesome ways. New in God of War II is the presence of collectible cyclops eyes that unlock bonus content if these combos are executed correctly when facing one of these tough enemies. In a way, the combat is even more brutal in this sequel, while retaining the original's appeal that made it an incredibly fun and rewarding game to master. In terms of weapons, throughout the game, a hammer and a lance will become available. Although not as out of the way as the Artemis' sword from the original game, these still work more like sub-weapons to the pair of Athenas' chain blades, Kratos' main armament. The same can be said about the new magic introduced in God of War II. While some of the magic gained becomes increasingly more useful as you plain, like the earthquake magic and the medusa gaze, while others, namely the electric discharge, is left aside as you level up and gain more additions to your magic catalog.  Some of Kratos' sensitive actions got tweaked, making the game more streamlined, switching in the controlled the buttons needed to open doors and chests, or use magic. Gone are the sometimes awkward R1 and L2 combinations, or the cumbersome magic switching. Now, the R2 button acts as the main context sensitive control, with the occasional need to use circle. Magic is activated with L2, and Rage of the Titans, God of War II's version of the old Rage of the Gods becomes active while simultaneously pressing R3 and L3. Among the new game play options comes the flying section early on in the game, that heavily uses these 'quick time events', while Kratos rides the skies from one point to the other. While not being the most creative addition ever, this flying section is just as intense as the rest of the game, even more on higher difficulty levels.  Just like God of War, this sequel presents variable difficulty options, with an extreme option available after the game is finished for the first time. The main draw to tackling these are the game's bonuses that can be unlocked, mainly optional costumes for Kratos. Not only that, scattered throughout God of War II's levels are jars that grant various 'cheat' options to the game, like infinite magic. These jars, however, can only be used while playing in the same difficulty setting that was used to unlock them.  Graphically, God of War II shows how much the PlayStation 2 got pushed during its life cycle. Character models are very detailed, with some top notch texture work all around. Even low polygon count structure models look stunning due to the great care that was obviously taken to the detailing of textures. Kratos himself is as tough as ever, and animates just as fluidly as the bloody massacres he causes during fights. Enemies in pain and dying struggle believably, and transitions between moves, even parried strikes, occur without lock-ups, in a natural way. The locales themselves are just gorgeous looking that look immense, even if most of the scenery can't be reached directly. The fixed camera perspective provides a huge scope, and leaves the action unhindered. It always thrusts Kratos to his new objective, clearing showing objectives, with quick close ups, for an example, to a switch that needs to be activated in order to proceed. The only noticeable problem is the occasional presence of vertical synchronization, which causes screen tear when moving too quickly and the camera tries to catch up to Kratos.  Like a big Hollywood blockbuster, as the original God of War, the sound work is incredible. TC Carson and Linda Hunt reprise the roles of Kratos and the narrator, respectively, in all their over the top glory. Some notable additions make their presence heard, literally, like Michael Clark Duncan, who plays the titan Atlas, and Harry Hamlin, reprising his cult classic Perseus role from Clash of the Titans. The music is just as epic as the original's, with heavy orchestral scores and chorals, that the sound and visual experience with intense tunes playing during tough spots in the action, relaxing as Kratos gets a breather.  While the story tilts and tumbles around, leaving a huge cliffhanger for an obvious sequel. Along with God of War II's game disc, there is a separate bonus DVD presents 'making of' and developer interview videos, with some insight into the game's development cycle, like deleted levels, concept art ideas and beta testing towards the actual game release. Just like God of War's bonus video content that featured the charismatic Dave Jaffe, God of War II's Corey Burton carries the torch in enjoyable and interesting footage.  God of War II neither tries to invent the wheel nor ride it without worries - it continues the excellent legacy of the original, in a brutal, bloody and incredibly satisfying way. With more boss battles, grander scale and challenges, it proves that a sequel can in fact improve on the quality of its original game, raising the bar even higher. \",\n",

       " {'deck': 'GRAW is Very Solid, But Not Perfect',\n",
       "  'description': 'IntroductionTom Clancy\\'s Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter is a third person tactical shooter with some squad elements mixed in and overall, is a beautiful game that, most of the time, is fun to play.GameplayThe gameplay in GRAW is solid. The controller rumbles every time you shoot a bullet, are close to an explosion, or get hit. The campaign is decent sized at around 10-12 hours.\\xa0On most of the missions, you will have a squad of three by your side. These three are smart (most of the time). You can give them commands like give them directions to cover. Another command is to tell whether to go into assault mode where they shoot once they see an enemy or recon mode where they are more tactile about when and when not to shoot. Also on most missions you will have a UAV drone which is basically a small circular flying object with a camera. When you bring up your tactical map, you can tell your drone where to go to check things out. Much like your squadmates, you can give the drone commands. It can go into scout mode which keeps it higher in the air so they are safe from enemy fire, or detect mode where it gets closer to the ground and and can show you where enemies are but it is succeptible to enemy fire.Another important part of the gameplay is your heads up display (HUD) called the crosscom. While your playing, whenever you have allies under your control, there will be a box in the upper left hand corner of the screen showing you what your teammates are seeing through their eyes. In the upper right hand corner, there will be a box that appears usually showing either a general from the military giving you orders, or any other important NPC that is not part of your squad usually giving you new objectives, or giving you news that progresses the story.One of the only complaints that I have is that sometimes, the realistic damage modeling can be too punishing. One bullet takes you from green to yellow on your heartbeat monitor, another takes you from yellow to orange, one more takes you from orange to red, and one more finishes you off. That might have sounded like a lot but it\\'s four bullets. I like realism as much as the next guy, but it may be a little to realistic for it\\'s own good.\\xa0GraphicsThe graphics are some of the best the system has to offer so far. The particle effects are good. For instance when a grenade explodes to a pillar of fire when a car gets blown up. Everything looks great. Your fellow ghosts look good too each wearing something different helping give them their own personality.\\xa0But some character models don\\'t look that great including the VIPs and the enemy models. You don\\'t really notice the how well the VIP looks when your trying to get him to the extraction point cause you\\'re trying to kill every rebel who gets in your way. But once you get them to safety, for instance, at the end of a couple levels you and the American president get in the back of the transport vehicle. And if you look over at him while he\\'s talking, you\\'ll notice that he doesn\\'t move his mouth when he talks and he doesn\\'t look quite as good as the other characters. And the enemies get old after awhile. They look pretty much the same up close, and they aren\\'t spectacular looking. But these things are very minor.\\xa0Mexico City looks really impressive when you\\'re flying from a helicopter looking over the city when the sun is rising. All of the buildings are very detailed. The on foot action looks great to with shadows and lighting effects everywhere.And in my experience with the game, I didn\\'t have the framerate hitch up on me at all.SoundThe sound in GRAW is excellent. The weapon sounds are pretty well done. The voice acting is good and the chatter from your enemies is in their native language and sounds good. The explosions sound like they have force to them and GRAW even goes as far as when you\\'re flying in the helicopter and there isn\\'t any action going on, you hear the pilot and co-pilot playing their music. The sound is really well done.ValueLike I said earlier, the campaign takes about 10-12 hours to complete. You might be saying, \"Is there anything else to do?\" HECK YEAH! I\\'ve got one word for you...MULTIPLAYER. The multiplayer in GRAW is awesome. There are a lot of different game modes with variants you can pick such as number of respawns and enemy density. You get to customize your online personality with sunglasses, hats, and camo. I\\'ll leave the rest for you to find out but remember. It is very addictive and very fun. The multiplayer alone prolongs the time you spend with the game. It prolongs it a very long time.Conclusion\\xa0Overall, Tom Clancy\\'s Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter is a great 3rd person shooter with good gameplay, great graphics and sound, and a lot of lasting value with the multiplayer. But keep in mind, if you run and gun in this game, you will be killed within seconds of running out in the open and shooting at people you see. So if you like a solid 3rd person tactical shooter with some squad elements mixed in, check out Tom Clancy\\'s Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter.',\n",

       " {'deck': 'See if your intelligence is up to the standards in PQ',\n",
       "  'description': 'PQ: Practical Intelligence Quotient is actually one of the most original games to hit the PSP. Released nearly a year ago in Japan under the title Intelligent License, PQ is finally hitting the U.S. PQ is an indirect follow up to the cult PS1 game Intelligent Qube and I.Q Remix: Intelligent Qube for the PS2. PQ has you navigating yourself through virtual reality style rooms as you try to pass a series of puzzles or “questions” as they are referred to in the game. The game sounds easy which isn\\'t the case but you will definitely have fun during the game.PQ was also thought of by a professor named Masuo Koyasu. Mr. Koyasu is a psychology professor at Kyoto University. Mr. Koyasu has a theory which explains that there are at least seven independently functioning units of intelligence. Mr. Koyasu then applied this theory to games. He believes that this Practical Intelligence Quotient will replace the old paper IQ tests. So basically anyone who plays this game is getting a cool scientific study that isn’t boring and may become the standard of the future.One of the most striking things about the game is its simple look. You control a white colored character through levels that are a mix of MGS’s VR rooms and Tron. The levels have a neon look to them sometimes which is quite striking against the black backgrounds and is reminiscent of the film Tron. The amount of detail in the levels is nothing to talk about but for a puzzle game they are pretty sharp. The game has a grid look to it so that is where the MGS VR missions and Tron look comes from. There are no fancy visuals effects in the game so don’t be expecting a graphical show piece of the PSP’s power. The game is stylish however and has some very nice menu designs and a very cool intro.The main gameplay mechanics is to navigate a series of puzzles to reach a white door. There are a total of 100 puzzles in the game each with a time limit. Times for a question usually range from around 1 minute for some to 12 minutes for others. If you fail a question you will just continue to the next one. This creates a nice flow to the game since you will never be stuck at one particular question. The puzzles may range from moving objects so you can reach higher areas, avoiding guards, or map memory puzzles. Most of the levels will have you moving a block which is quite simple to do but figuring out how to use them is the hard part. The game makes this mechanic hard by having moving walkways, lasers, or moving stairs. The stealth levels are actually easy since all you have to do is avoid the light from the guard’s flashlight. Stealth does get harder in the game since more guard appears and with a faster movement pattern. There are also stealth missions where you have to move blocks or open doors while being undetected. Upon finishing a level you are scored on how fast you finished and the amount of moves you made. After you finish the game you are told what your playing style is, whether you are the \"Pondering Type\" or the \"Action Type\". Players can then go online via the PSP and post their scores to see how they stack up against other players and other countries.The game may grow tiresome to some since you\\'re constanly doing the same game mechanics all the time. Some puzzles have different game mechanics in one puzzle. This adds some variety to the game and makes you think more. My biggest gripe with the game is how your character can\\'t jump off of small platforms. You can\\'t jump off a platform that may be four feet high. I found this tedious when I hit a dead end and had to walk all the way back to the steps.The controls are pretty much simple. You control your character with the d-pad and you interact with objects using the x button. Moving or picking up objects is quite simple to do and is never a chore. Movement is based on a grid system so that takes awhile to get used to. The L and R buttons are for camera movement and you will definitely be using the camera often. At times the camera is obscured by objects and sometimes this is done on purpose but most of the time it isn’t. It’s best to rotate the camera around the environment so you get a better understanding of the layout.The soundtrack in PQ is an interesting mix of techno infused with classical music. There is definitely a techno vibe in the soundtrack but most of the music sounds like something from a classical radio station. The music is good but some players may grow tired of it since you\\'ll be listening to it for 100 levels. PQ is definitely a pick for those who are aching for a puzzle game that will actually make you think before you act. While the game does get extremely hard at the end you will still be determined to find out the solution and continue on. This game is not for everyone though so for those PSP users out there longing for a quality game I would recommend renting the game to test it out. There will definitely be times will you will want to throw your PSP in frustration. PQ is a unique game that should be recognized for its originality and what it brings to the gaming industry. ',\n",

       "  'description': 'I\\'ll come right out and say it, I\\'ve been a fan of the Metal Gear Solid series since it\\'s debut on Sony\\'s first PlayStation back in 1998. I\\'ve eagerly awaited each new entry in the series like a rabid hyena eyeballing a lion\\'s leftovers. But, I\\'ll be the first to admit the series had not produced a perfect entry, until now.Of course this all my opinion. If you\\'re among the many that can\\'t stomach watching cut scenes or being handed heavy doses of philosophy with your games then this entry in the MGS series won\\'t change your mind. However, if you\\'re looking for something as divine to experience as it is to play, then you would be making a mistake to pass this game up.Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, by some miracle, manages to tie up all the loose ends the series has collected over the previous three games and manages to raise the bar so high that when you\\'re finished you\\'ll wonder how its possible for so much awesome to be packed into one game.It\\'s something has to be experienced, writing about it does absolutely no good. Suffice it to say that for the first time, a video game has been able to stir emotions thought by the many to be for more \"artful\" entertainment mediums.With glorious action set pieces, amazing graphics and game play, some of the best cut scenes the business has ever seen, a truly harrowing event in the final act capped of by the most artistically amazing boss battle ever, Metal Gear Solid 4 manages not only deliver on the hype, but blow it away.

       " {'deck': 'No need to theorize - Sam can provide all the chaos you need.',\n",
       "  'description': \"Along with Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell brings to the world of gaming all the international intriguing cloak and dagger of espionage. Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is the third game in the long running Tom Clancy series developed by Ubisoft Montreal.  This time, Sam Fisher, a 'Splinter Cell' agent from a secret U.S government office called Third Echelon, and the game's protagonist, has to stop a terrorist group from seizing and using a computerized weapon system on the innocent. While not being the most creative story, it does provide some interesting situations in locations spread all around the world, like Tokyo and Seoul.  All the tools and gadgets from past games are present in Chaos Theory, including the various visors Sam can use to track different elements in the environment, and attachments that can be used on the rifle that is carried, in order to pacify enemy patrols in a quiet and non lethal fashion. One new addition is the combat knife which provides quick and silent kills, with a touch of a controller trigger. Speaking of triggers, the choice between killing someone rests on them. By pressing the left trigger while holding an enemy, he's taken down in a non lethal manner, while pressing the right trigger provides a more aggressive - and violent - solution. Choosing between these plays a part in missions where there are civilians around, since one direct innocent death equals a failure. Other than these cases, killing or incapacitating a victim doesn't effect your overall result. At the beginning of every mission, an assortment of weapons and items is sorted in three classes - stealth, assault and a recommended package. Usually, the choice doesn't effect the overall progression of the level, since most items can be found scattered in store rooms, conveniently enough.   Sneaking is still a major part of the game, and sticking to dark areas, moving quietly and not alerting enemies is the way to go in most cases. Lights can generally be shot out - or blown out in case of candles in a certain mission - while cameras have to be avoided and are invulnerable to weapon fire. Some of these cameras can also possess infra red vision, which can track Sam in the dark. Along with these surveillance always present in any respectable stealth action game, UAVs also make their presence in a mission. These flying robots can not only track targets in the dark, but also shoot back, providing an extra challenge to the game. There is, however, still a presence of trial and error in many locations, due to some erratic enemy behavior, both mechanical and human.  A darker tone is present in Chaos Theory, which provides a Mature rating not present in past games of the series. There are, however, many humorous moments provided by the various characters present in the levels. Enemy troops, no matter their nationality, always speak English, with strong and over the top accents. Interrogation will normally net Sam with info regarding their mission, but from time to time, a joke will be thrown, making many cultural references. Jabs at another certain stealth action game happen often, in dialogues between Sam, played again by Michael Ironside - of Total Recall fame - and Lambert, Sam's contact in Third Echelon, voiced by Don Jordan. The orchestrated soundtrack sometimes seems over the top as well, and very limited, with the same track being played at various points in the game. Normally, though, silence will be Sam's only companion, with confrontations and tense moments being the cue for a dramatic score - or a bizarre techno beat, in a case or two in some levels.   The graphical presentation of Chaos Theory is just as slick as ever, with great atmospheric lighting and texture work. Characters as mostly well rendered, although all enemies caught in Sam's grip tend to look similarly, and behave the same way when scared, independent of race or ethnical differences. Fisher moves smoothly, with excellent transition animations between rolls and dodges. Still, rotating him to another direction looks out of place, since he'll just slide in a set pivot point, which detracts from the overall realism the game tries to set. Surfaces on walls and on the ground also tend to reflect light realistically, but will behave strangely in terms of providing dark hiding spots, with bright spots in the reflections being considered unlit by the game.  A play through of the game will take around ten hours from start to end, with the possibility of replays at the game's three different difficulty settings. These settings tweak the sense of awareness of guards, as well as the quantity of available equipment, and the times alarms can be triggered in the missions. The challenge tends to be rather unbalanced at certain points, due to erratic programmed intelligence given to enemy units, and the complexity of the game's control scheme, which can be overwhelming to someone new to the Splinter Cell series. For this, the game tries to remedy the situation with some tutorial videos, which are sadly hidden away at a menu and not presented as a visible suggestion for new players to check out.  Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, while not bringing anything particularly new to the series, still manages to provide interesting situations, enough to warrant a sneak and peek at what Mr. Clancy manages to come up with in this ever growing game series.\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'A game that is enjoyable at times but its a one-trick pony.',\n",
       "  'description': \"Condemned is a first-person action game  brought to you by Sega and Monolith Studios, the same team that brought you the  hit PC game, F.E.A.R and if you have played that game then as you play this  game, you see some certain similarities with the spookiness and craziness that  occurs as you progress through the short but fairly enjoyable 10  chapters.Condemned: Criminal Origins to give it its full title sees you  play the part of a federal agent known as Ethan Thomas who is somewhat on the  run after being framed for the murders of a fellow agent and an officer that he  accompanied while investigating a crime scene in this crummy, run down building  that you are at in the beginning of the game. The reason he is framed is because  the murder weapon was his own gun but it was someone else who did it and this  person is sort of the main villain of the game as you follow him and track him  down throughout the game and eventually you do. The villain is known as Serial  Killer X although near the end of the game, you found out his true  identity.There is another side to the story as well as there is somewhat  an outbreak of these strange people around the areas that you visit and kind of  have a similarity in a way to the Los Illuminados from Resident Evil 4. They  attack you on sight with various types of melee weapons, which will be explained  in just a bit and at times, firearms also. Ethan comes across these people and  also has strange visions of freakish creatures that haunt his mind and you find  out a bit more about this as you progress but maybe not as much as you would  like.The gameplay of Condemned sees you in a first-person view and at  first glance, you may think this will be another bog-standard first person  shooter and the fact is, it isn't. Firearms come into play in the game but they  are not the main attraction. What the main attraction of the gameplay is that  you use melee weapons from pipes and 2 by 4s to sledgehammers and fire axes and  the unique thing is that each weapon has its strengths and weaknesses. An  example is that a sledgehammer is strong but is slow while a pipe is fast to  execute but weaker than some of the other weapons.You use these melee  weapons to take care of these so-called psychopaths as you progress through the  10 chapters of the game but there is also firearms included but they are not the  main focus because when you obtain one, you have a limited number of bullets in  each weapon and once used up, they are pretty much useless although you can also  use them for melee attacks but are quite weak compared to other melee  weapons.The game is not all about action now as there is another side to  the gameplay in that you go around and actually get evidence using the different  forensic tools that are at your disposal and usually most of the clues that you  obtain are the same. Examples include photos, blood stains, track marks etc.  This is a nice little addition to the game anyway although sometimes it is not  entirely relevant.The action in the game is nice although once you get  past the first chapter and believe that there will be different aspects of  gameplay, you will find yourself disappointed because that is all that the game  offers and just goes on and on for 9 more chapters and that you will get bored  at times, as you use some of the same old weapons to progress further on in some  levels.The graphics in the game are good although some things in the  game could have been done a lot better. The models themselves are very nicely  detailed and you encounter different type of freaks although they do get  repetitive as time goes on. The different melee weapons and firearms available  in the game are good to look at but maybe could have a bit more work into the  game to really show off the 360's power but are detailed fairly good to make you  appreciate them each time you use them.The environments in the game are  somewhat repetitive, mainly because most of the time it is quite dark but that  is what the game is going after, dark and spooky and for that, it hits the nail  on the head and some of the environments have detailed items and can walk around  each chapter and appreciate some of the finer items on display.The sound  in this game is what makes this game worth playing as from the good voice acting  to the superb sounds of the weapons available, you will find out why the sound  in this game is the best feature of all. The sound is delightful to listen to  when you first whack someone with a melee weapon because you just feel the noise  of the impact on the enemy and it is a pleasure to listen to over and over again  and for me, it never got old as I played through this game. The firearms and  forensic tools have good sound also but you would keep using the melee weapons  just to hear the different impact sounds.Is the game worth the purchase?  Well, in my eyes, no. The reason fpr this is that you can just fly through it in  about the 8-10 hour mark and really no good reason to go through it again unless  you want all the achievements in this game that you missed out the first time  round. There are 50 achievements overall if you are the kind of guy that likes  their 360 points and some of them consist of getting the different items hidden  throughout the game (birds and metal pieces to be exact) and completing the  levels and game only using melee weapons.In the end, Condemned is worth  a rental at best but although it is enjoyable at times thanks to the different  weapons and excellent sounds, it is too much of a one-trick pony to make it  essential. \",\n",

       " {'deck': 'Burnout Legends crashes onto the PSP with this faithful port',\n",
       "  'description': 'Over the past two years, the Burnout games have quickly become the epitome of what the arcade racing experience is; fast racing and insane crashes. Now that experience is on the PSP with Burnout Legends. Just like Ridge Racer for the PSP, Legends is essentially a best of title that includes a variety of the tracks and vehicles from the first three Burnout titles. The game has the flavor and feel of the Burnout series but that’s not to say there aren’t a few bumps in the road.Burnout Legends is basically modeled after Burnout 3. The menus are the same and you have your typical modes which include tour, single event, and wireless play. The tour mode is just like Burnout 3 in that you compete in different events ranging from traditional races, road rage, rival races and crash events. These events are held in the same three countries featured in Burnout 3 which were America, Europe and Asia. Like the previous titles the player can fulfill objectives during the race to win awards. These objectives range from performing a set number of crashes or doing a unique crash. Crashing your opponents is encouraged since it gives you ‘boost’. Boost is basically nitro and can make your car go faster when you press down the R1 button. You can also gain boost by driving on the opposite side of the road or narrowly escaping collisions. As you progress through the tour you can unlock new vehicles. These vehicles may just be souped up versions of the cars you already have or they could be themed cars, such as a grand prix car or a white 1930’s gangster car. The tour mode is where the bulk of the gameplay is and it doesn’t disappoint. The amount of races for each city and country are handled effectively. You never feel like you’ve spent too much time in one country so the game stays fresh. The game does get a bit more difficult as you progress but it doesn’t reach the same insane difficulty that Burnout 3 reached during its latter stages. You will constantly feel a sense of achievement due to all the cars and courses you unlock as you progress. Pursuit Mode which was last seen in Burnout 2 makes a comeback. Pursuit Mode has you playing a police officer as they try to take down a criminal. This mode basically plays a lot like Road Rage since the goal is to take enemies out in a time limit. The Road Rage event suffers from the same issues that plagued Burnout 3. The courses in Road Rage are sometimes a bit too wide, which makes trying to get to your opponents harder than it should be. Another issue is that it takes some time to generate the opponents after you’ve crashed them. The fact that Criterion didn’t fix the course design for the Road Rage events is odd since it was one of the most criticized elements in Burnout 3.One of the main attractions of the Burnout series has been the crash mode. In this mode you’re given the simple task of crashing your car into traffic to cause as much damage as possible. There are 100 total crash junctions in the game. These junctions are taken from certain parts of the courses from the tour mode. To change things up the junctions have various ramps littered throughout. Also along the courses are various icons. These icons range from 2x and 4x multipliers and Crashbreaker icons. The 2x and 4x icons will multiply your score while the Crashbreaker icon will blow your car up. A key element of the crash mode is using Aftertouch. By holding down the R1 button your car will slow down and you can direct it into the path of other vehicles. Aftertouch is integral because its one of the best ways to rack up points. It would have been nice if Burnout Revenge’s crash mode was in the game since it included better game mechanics.Several gameplay elements that were featured in Burnout Revenge are sadly missing in action. The ability to traffic check vehicles is gone, which can be seen as both a good and bad thing. The lack of traffic checking raises the tension since you can’t be as wreckless with your driving. However there are times where the slightest hit against a car will send you crashing which will leave you frustrated. The rivals system from Revenge is in the game but it doesn’t have that same flair as its console counterpart. The vertical takedowns from Revenge are also absent. If gamers have been playing a lot of Revenge and then go to Legends they will probably have to readapt themselves to the differences in gameplay. Legends also support GameSharing so you can wirelessly load a demo to your friends PSP and play against him in a quick match. This feature however does take awhile to load and may not be worth the time. Legends supports AdHoc play but not Infrastructure so you can’t play online. It would have been if the game supported downloadable content like Wipeout Pure but I guess that’ll be in the sequel. Each copy of the game has five cars that are only available on that UMD. The point of this is to have players play against each other with their unique cars and whoever wins gets the losers car. This is an interesting concept but would have been better implemented on the console version.The control in the game is quite tight on the PSP. Whether you’re using the analog nub or d-pad, controlling your car is easy. Pulling off drifts is easy but sometimes pulling out of them is a bit difficult. Drifting in Legends just feels a lot looser compared to Takedown and Revenge. Using Aftertouch is easy sometimes but in a few instances my few of the oncoming vehicles was completely obscured. Aside from the sometimes loose drifting the controls for Legends are spot on.The graphics in Legends are quite good but they don’t reach the same level as found in Ridge Racer or Wipeout Pure. Car models are detailed nicely but feature aliasing. There are also quite noticeable texture stitching found through the courses as well. At times the game will slightly freeze for a second and then continue. This will not deter you from your experience. The courses themselves are done well and there is hardly any pop-up noticeable. The crashes are nicely detailed and cars will rip apart with a nice amount of detail. However, the explosion effects found on the crash mode are a bit lackluster and leave a bit more to be desired. You don’t feel the same impact from the explosions in Legends as you do in Revenge. The physics are also quite floaty as cars will literally be flying after crashing. There are also several glitches in the game which will often the cars levitating after a crash Audio is one of the aspects that the Burnout games excel in and Legends does an admirable job. While not as visceral as Revenge, the audio in Legends quite effectively conveys the intensity of the crashes and the sense of speed. However there is and odd glitch in the game in which typically after a crash the audio will go down a lot or at times there will be no audio. I often found myself boosting my car so that the audio went back up. The game features EA Trax so you can expect the same soundtrack that was featured in Revenge. The same annoying track listing pops up in the left corner of the screen. The constant pop up is quite bothersome since it takes up a good portion of the bottom left corner.Burnout Legends does an admirable job of trying to replicate the Burnout experience on a handheld but it could have used some more polish. While the game doesn’t feel sloppily put together like other PSP games (e.g. SSX On Tour), it just could have used some new features since a good portion of the game comes from Burnout 3. It may be good for those wanting the Burnout experience on their PSP but if you unlocked everything and had 100% gold in Burnout 3 it would be best just to rent Legends. It’s disappointing that Legends doesn’t have the gameplay and visual flair of Revenge but that can be forgiven.',\n",

       "  'description': 'When someone talks about gangster movies, most people remember The Godfather, with its \\'40s representation of what the lives of gangsters were like. How about the \\'80s? How did those gangsters evolve? These were questions that found their answers in Scarface, released into theaters in 1983. In a setting reminiscent to Miami Vice\\'s, the movie told the story of Tony Montana, a cuban exile that arrives in Miami with nothing but his clothes, and ends up taking over the whole town by force. The film was hailed by many for its gritty setting, including the violence, the drug-pushing and the resulting \\'being a bad guy is good\\' feel.  At the end of the story, some mighty violent events happen, and Tony Montana is caught in the crossfire. But what would have happened if things had gone differently? Now, twenty three years later, Radical Entertainment is set on answering that problem with Scarface: The World is Yours, set right into the end of the film, with Tony speaking his famous catchphrase while holding a automatic rifle. It\\'s his mission to get even with with all his enemies, and get the city back to his control. Heavily influenced by Grand Theft Auto, especially by Vice City, which in turn was influenced by Scarface, the game does its best to mimick the latter game\\'s feeling and ambiance. Both musically and visually, the game succeeds in this, making someone who played Vice City feel right at home. When everything gets moving and the time comes to play the game, the situation changes, and many will probably wish they were back in Tommy\\'s, and not Tony\\'s shoes.  The game takes a road similar to The Godfather game released earlier this year: as the game is played, points are added to various attributes, like reputation, money, turf percentages, exotic items found, drugs pushed and... balls. All other attributes are easily explainable, except the... balls. This attribute is measured by how the game is played. If the built-in lock-on system isn\\'t used, and shots are made to count, the balls meter goes up, and when in max, Tony can go into a \\'bullet-time\\' type of rage state, which makes him invulnerable and his shots go right into the targets. The gunplay and fight system in the game are based upon a lock-on system, but can be played freely. The enemy hit detection is sensitive to body parts, and it awards the player for precise shooting. The \\'balls\\' meter also goes up, but much less, for just killing enemies, so the many players who are likely to use the aiming feature won\\'t miss out on the rage attacks. Even so, the action tends to be very forgiving, letting Tony literally walking into full clips of bullets before going down.After a successful kill, Tony can then taunt the victim, and thus net some of the balls\\' points mentioned earlier. The taunts are mainly movie lines, like \\'you think you can (add profanity) me?\\' or \\'say hello to my little friend\\'. Mostly, these lines seem out of place, and most of the times, theydon\\'t really make sense - if the room is full of dead bodies, who would be scared by Tony\\'s \\'friend\\'? Strange. The weapons can be acquired on site and before levels, while in the mansion. Successfully completing levels unlocks new types of guns. The driving is done exactly like GTA, including the car-jacking everyone\\'s so used to.  The A.I in the game is very poor, with some cases where the enemies stand around looking oblivious to the chaos around. Other attributes like turf and drugs are filled as you play the game, taking in territory from gangs, pushing drugs and making deals with the various \\'business\\' persons in town. The deal-making system is something unique to the game: a meter goes up on screen whenever Tony engages in a discussion with a possible negotiation. By holding down the action button, the meter fills up, and by releasing the button in time with the necessary pressure, the deal goes down successfully, or not. The same meter is used for what I call the \"please don\\'t arrest me\" type of situations, where Tony will be pulled up by a cop after some mayhem is done, and tries to sweet talk the policeman. If unsuccessful, your \\'heat\\' goes up, and Tony turns into a wanted person. Unfortunately this system is very unprecise, and the game doesn\\'t try too hard to explain how it works, or even when it\\'s supposed to work. Levels use the same kind of mission design everyone who plays GTA, Manhunt, The Godfather and the like are used to, with the classic pick-up, chase, protect, shoot everyone and \\'steal this and take there\\' molds. The repetition comes early on during the story mode, which is nothing that will take more than a few seatings to play through the story mode. After that, there\\'s a lot to be done if one is still interested in the game, as properties and dealers are waiting to be conquered, not to mention enemy territories being turned to Tony\\'s turf.  The control department is a varies from versions: whereas the console games respond quickly to the controls inputted, the PC version has that distinct lag that plagues most console-to-PC ports and makes the game feel floaty and unprecise. Customization is an option, and controllers can be opted instead of the traditional mouse and keyboard setting, leaving the same lag during game play. As a matter of fact, the game plays more fluently using the game\\'s primary control setting.  The presentation of the game is spot on. As far as actor resemblance goes, Tony\\'s facial features and body gestures look like Al Pacino circa 1983, capturing everything that made Pacino\\'s performance remembered. Strangely enough, however, body proportions for the characters seem mighty strange, especially Tony, with big hands and head, compared to the rest of the cast. It ends up making the game\\'s Tony more a caricature than anything else. Character voice work is mostly well done, including famous names like James Woods, Ice T and Rodrigo Santoro. Tony Montana isn\\'t dubbed by Al Pacino, who helped the developer\\'s choose the voice actor for his role, and ends up being a good choice, seeing how the aging actors fared in The Godfather\\'s voice work. James Woods doesn\\'t sound as immersed in the role as he did in GTA San Andreas, but does his job nonetheless.Tony\\'s voice actor sounds spot on in all the fronts, from the detailed curses to the accented pronunciation of words. The soundtrack is just what one would expect from a title set in the \\'80s, and includes all of the tracks from the movie, including some that were in Vice City (duh!) and GTA III\\'s classic radio station. The music can be played directly from a menu while driving, not using any kind of radio host or anything of the sort.  Across the three platforms the game was released, the visual difference is nigh: a mostly good looking PS2 game ends up looking poorly on the Xbox, and \\'ported\\' poorly on the PC. Options like draw in and aliasing can be tweaked in the PC version of the game, not changing how the game mainly looks overall. The console versions, however, play as any action game should, and make the game a better choice than the current crop of GTA clones, namely Just Cause. Scarface borrows a lot from games from the genre, like Mercenaries, with its merchant options and vehicle delivery, plus its mission briefing style and \\'gang\\' loyalty system... however, the heavier influence, is of course the GTA formula, which the game adds a few twists and turns that make it feel more like an expansion pack than anything else. If you\\'re feeling nostalgic about Vice City, and have thoroughly played that game, found everything and just killed the equivalent of the population of a small country, Scarface: The World is Yours fills the gap for a while. Also, fans of the movie will eat this oportunity up, but it will feel weird to first time movie goers, and not make much sense if they end up watching the movie after playing the game.  The current trend in movie tie-ins with videogames is just a baby and most players should expect to see more and more franchises getting poor game translations. Luckily for this game, it does it a little better than Tarantino\\'s flick-turned-to-game Reservoir Dogs, thanks to the visual and sound fidelity between mediums. Unfortunately, problems like repetition, low difficulty and lack of replay incentive don\\'t let this game sit on the same shelf, quality-wise, as The Godfather or The Warriors, which are still the best movie franchise-revival titles around.',\n",

       " {'deck': \"Crypto's back and this time he's got the groove.\",\n",
       "  'description': \"Whoever played last year's Destroy All Humans! enjoyed a great action adventure game filled with fun bits and bites into 1950's United States cultural background. From the nuclear paranoia to the American economic power after World War II, basically everything was touched, and thoroughly destroyed.  A year and change after, Destroy All Humans! 2 is released by Pandemic Studios, the same company responsible for Mercenaries and Star Wars Battlefront. Far from being a worse game than the original one, Crypto's second foray into human destruction doesn't have the same charm as before.  After the final showdown between Crypto and the super robot at the of Destroy All Humans!, the big-headed alien assumes the role of the president of the United States and controls the country from the White House. Ten years later, it's 1969, and the hippie movement is at its peak and free love is all around. Crypto is throwing a huge party at the White House, when he finds out that the Furon mothership, along with Pox, his boss, is destroyed by a warhead launched by none other than the Soviet Union. Luckily (or unluckily for Crypto), Pox manages to survive the blast, at least in a sort of way, by transplanting his soul to a cybernetic machine. Unfortunately, all the Furon genetic material collected during the last game was lost, and now Crypto is responsible for re-stocking the genetic mount and most importantly, find out who was really behind the attack, and destroy them (what else?). With that in mind, he will travel across the world, finding all the stereotypes of the time while causing mayhem: hippies camping out in the U.S.A, super spies walking around in the U.K, ninjas in Japan and whatever the heck was around at the U.S.S.R. at the time.  Some changes were made to the Destroy All Humans gameplay system in order to make it more dynamic. Crypto can now get into dialogues with secondary characters other than Pox and get missions from them as well. New weapon updgrades can also be collected after successful missions and throughout the maps during free-roaming - this makes exploring the various maps more rewarding, since maxing out the most useful weapons and abilities is recommended toward the end levels of the game. Along with the story-based missions, Crypto has to please the Furon 'mojo' god Arkvoodoo, who's always looking for new followers. In these missions, people need to be convinced to join the sex god's cause - some are easily convinced after some dialogue, while others ask for favors in exchange for their support. Another task that needs to be done for Arkvoodoo is activating the various pedestals scattered across the maps - by completing simple tasks like random destruction or cleaning, a new landing zone for the UFO is opened, thus giving more escape routes for tough situations.  Combat is basically unaltered for the previous game. Crypto can jump and gain some air thanks to his portable jet pack, use his mental powers and has an expanded choice of weaponry at his disposal - both for on foot and saucer situations, all of which can be upgraded and expanded during the game. Old favorites like the Death Ray and the Anal Probe are back, along with the new Dislocator, a gun that fires discs that once attached to an enemy (both organic or not), will crash randomly into objects, causing massive damage. UFO flying remains with the same core gameplay as in the previous game, with minor changes that make battles much easier than before. By using the saucer's Abducto Beam on enemy and civilian vehicles, the ship's shields can be recharged, making the refill item hunt from the past game useless, which is a plus. On the weapons side, just like the ones for on foot combat, there are additions. While not as impacting as the ones mentioned above, the overall weapon group is well sorted and balanced.  The stealth play is changed: now called body snatching, Crypto can now spend a limited time with a human body before it disintegrates, without the possibility of refilling health like before. While this brings a bigger challenge to playing the game, it does become annoying when the time runs out and Crypto is in the middle of an unpopulated area. Along with this new twist, depending on what type of person is snatched, Crypto can use the emergency phones found on the levels in order to bring the 'heat' down - by either snatching a police officer or military body. The snatching per se has its dangers - while in it, any suspicious behavior will be noted by passers, requiring some 'mental distractions' in order not to attract too much attention from authorities. Human snatching plays another role, on a genetic side - while in the saucer, people can be abducted using the Adbucto Beam, in order to harvest their DNA. Each type of person, ranging from cops to hippies, has their unique kind of genetic material. This material can then be mixed in the 'gene blender' in order to acquire updates to Crypto's abilities or minor updates like faster body-snatching for particular types of people.  Like before, the game's humor is one of its highlights. Unfortunately, the game doesn't sport a great comedic content as Destroy All Humans! - since there's a lot more material to be explored for the time, and the game tries to take cues from everything, which leaves room for improvement, since some of the mentioned cues are more superficial than others, unbalancing the equation between funny and cheesy. A fine line. Most of the humor is again provided by the voice cast for Pox and Crypto. Crypto sounds as much Jack Nicholson as before, and Pox's actor takes a lot of what he does in the Billy and Mandy cartoons to his performance in the game. The secondary voices, however, are stale, and most of the mind reading throughout the game will sound boring and not very emotive.  Graphically, Destroy All Humans! 2 doesn't disappoint in comparison to the crop of games in the current generation of consoles. The primary characters look great and the scenery is mostly detailed well. While secondary, civilian and enemy characters tend to be less detailed and in that limited visually, it's nothing that hasn't been seen on similar games like Hulk Ultimate Destruction. Some of the secondary characters that play an important part in certain parts of the game, like the Russian spy, look a lot worse in the in-game graphics engine in comparison to their pre-rendered video counterparts. The game's worse graphical defect is the draw in, and while flying around in the UFO this effect is notoriously visible - the hardware can't keep up with the software. This is stronger in the Playstation 2 version of the game, and while it keeps up with the Xbox version visually, this problem tends to be far worse on that system.  The game does sport some replay, and like the previous game, most of it will be for revisiting levels with new abilities, in order to collect items and artifacts. Along with the artifacts, bonus movies and stills are unlocked, varying from production photos to gag videos. Most of the material is worth the effort, and for the hardcore player, 100% takes a while to be reached, considering the massive amount of item variety and collectibles to be found. The overall time with the game can be estimated to around twenty hours, and the main story mode is quickly finished if no exploration and side-questing is done, clocking in at about six to eight hours to beat, depending on how many reloads are required.  While Destroy All Humans! 2 isn't as great as the past title, it does hold up with the competition and is worth checking out. Fans of the first game have no reason not to avoid this one. New players to the series might consider giving the first game a try as well after playing this one.\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'Halo fits the bill nicely as the first Xbox FPS.',\n",
       "  'description': 'In 2001, a little known Apple-based developer called Bungie released a game that would be on of the launch titles for Microsoft’s first venture in the video game console business. Its name was Halo. Seven years later, with a sequel under its belt and millions of copies sold worldwide, Halo shows that being a multi-million seller game doesn’t exactly mean it has to be bland nor easy in difficulty.  It all starts about five hundred and fifty years into the future, the human race is through building on Earth and brings its construction skills to space. Massive space stations cruise through the vast emptiness of the galaxies. Sadly, emptiness isn’t an option, and space is too crowded for a video game. Peace wouldn’t be a good setting for one. The Covenant, a race of intergalactic beings who aren’t to happy with that threatens to wipe humanity off the map. With it, a massive orbital station is discovered during the many battles that both races ensued – a ring shaped weapon of gigantic proportions, named Halo, that was built by an unknown civilization.  During one battle in particular, the Pillar of Autumn, a massive space station built by the humans, is being directly attacked by Covenant troops while it was making its way to the planet that is surrounded by Halo. The cyborg Master Chief is aboard the station and is entrusted the mission of saving as many personnel as possible. This mission leads to an all out, one-person guerrilla battle against the Covenant, in order to reach Halo and find out its purpose. Being made to run off a video game console and not a computer, Halo imposed a major challenge to the developers at Bungie. Very few FPS games in the past managed to work with a controller in the past, and not only that, but the Xbox was a new system with a controller that was different than what was available at the time. The two triggers function the same way as gun triggers, with the option to change whether the left or right one is the gun control and the other is the grenade throw. The analog sticks function as the movement and aiming controls, allowing a full 360 degree movement pattern – left, right, forward and back, including diagonals and the different heights of aiming, from standing to crouch. Much to all the brawler’s delight, a melee attack is assigned to the B button, which works well in conjunction with a grenade in the many tight spots you’ll find yourself in the game. Instead of using the common array of different weaponry that is collected that are managed in an inventory like most shooters, Bungie took a different approach that works as an extra layer of strategy to the gun fights, that all in all wasn’t completely original at the time, but works really well with the tense action featured in the game. Having the choice to carry only two weapons at a time, you are forced to decide what approach you want to take to battles. With a touch to the Y button, guns can be changed on the fly. The weapons themselves make this decision even harder, as they are all a blast to use, pun totally intended. Divided between the two warring factions, all weapons can be used by the Chief. The humans have the handgun, which contrary to common shooter belief, is extremely useful and precise, an assault rifle, the weapon that against all popular opinion will be the one weapon that will be least used, a shotgun, a bringer of pain at close quarters, a sniper rifle that can be deadly at stealth situations and the rocket launcher, the most fun use of three tunes that anyone could come up with in 2552. The Covenant provide interesting alternatives, amongst the which include the plasma pistol, a small and deadly green laser gun, the plasma rifle, which shoots out blue laser bolts at a fast rate, the needler, a weapon fires deadly target-homing laser bolts at an extremely fast rate, and the plasma grenade, which functions the same way as its human counterpart, with a catch: targets can be tagged by it, turning them into involuntary kamikazes. The main difference between human and Covenant weapons is the fact that the aliens don’t have to reload. While that proves to be useful during battles, it makes dropping and exchanging guns a must in order not to run out of ammo in the middle of fire fights.\\xa0 The tactical savvy will choose to make a mix between both styles of weapons, as in most cases, ammo and guns are plenty for whatever choice they make.  Fire fights in Halo are the main point of the experience. With an absurd quantity which rivals any war movie around, the best terms that can describe the battles in Halo are pop and shoot. Along with normal hit points, Master Chief has the cover of rechargeable armor to protect him. When he gets hit, the armor decreases, and when that\\'s gone, he\\'s vulnerable to fire. When that happens, hiding in a spot for a couple of seconds will refill the armor, and the fight can continue. It may seem like the fights come pre-chewed due to this, but the enemy numbers will make it up ten-fold. In most of the fire fights you\\'ll be alone and outnumbered, with few and far between cases where you get a bit of support from fellow soldiers. While the fights are pure action and adrenaline pumped parts of the game, they tend to be repetitive, due to the overuse of the same locations throughout some parts of the game. Level design, from the middle of the game til the end is bland at best: corridors and bases are repeated too often, resulting in a sense of deja vú every time you pass through a door to an enemy filled room. The level design also comes in the way of the progression, because most of the times the locales look a bit too similar, and in some cases that makes you run in circles if you get too caught up in a fire fight.  The enemy comes in a variety of forms. Normal grunts tend to be group-based, getting scattered if separated, thus, easy prey. Higher ranking Covenants, called Elites, carry a limited shield similar to the Chief\\'s and take longer to be killed, and due to the fact there are more than a couple of types of these, you\\'ll definitely be kept on your toes. Hunters will be somewhat of a challenge the first time, and once you get the hang of fighting groups with mixed enemy types, Halo game play truly shines. Even the most frantic of battles can be won with careful aiming, patience and precisely aimed grenades, but for the hasty types, mounted guns can be found scattered around the battlefields as well, for a \"retribution\" type comeback. Deeper through the game\\'s story, that should take a medium skilled player about fifteen hours to complete, you\\'ll come across some other challenges better left unspoken.  Unlike most FPS, vehicles do play a big role in Halo. Ranging from a super powered tank called Scorpion to an ATV with a mounted gun, the humans aren\\'t defenseless. The Covenant don\\'t stay very far behind, with they own versions of attack vehicles, like the hover bike Ghost, armed with a precise laser and the Banshee, an aircraft that behaves similarly to a Harrier fight jet, taking off vertically and with two types of weapons on board, both for ground assault. In the humans\\' case, non playable characters can join Master Chief either on the side or Gatling gun/rocket launcher seat in the ATV\\'s case, or the gunner and side panel seats on the tank, but the driving is left for the Chief.  Halo\\'s soundtrack comes as a sidekick to the action, balancing the pace of the game and giving you cues about what\\'s going to happen. In particular instances, you\\'ll be in an area without any sound, only to be greeted by a tense theme, telling you an ambush is about to take place. The game\\'s main theme is a mix of choir and electronic music that seems a bit out of place sometimes, while in others, it\\'s perfectly attuned wit the action. The sound effect department is on par with the music, and while it\\'s nothing to write home about, it get\\'s the job done. Graphically, Halo is still impressive in comparison to newer Xbox games and even shooters. There are some instances of blurry effects and rough edges, and slowdown does occur when too much particle effects appear on screen at the same time. Weapon models are detailed to the point of the assault rifle having an ammo counter besides the HUD. Speaking of HUD, a blueish theme is seen throughout the entire game, off and into menus, in the panels you\\'ll rarely use to open doors and operate elevators and even in on screen text messages reminding you of your objectives. All is easily readable even in standard definition TVs. Other details, like textures and lighting effects aren\\'t tough to the eye, and it shows how much games evolved in the six years that separate this game from genre setting examples like GoldenEye and Rainbow Six.  While Halo tends to be a rinse and repeat type of game, the repeated portions are well done and worth going through til the end. The different types of weapons, enemies and settings make up for the lack of variety in the levels, and can encourage multiple plays through the game using different tactics and approaches. For a launch title, Halo certainly delivers, even today. If you still are in doubt whether or not this game is worth playing, consider this: if you played any other FPS on the Xbox, you certainly played a bit of Halo, because some mechanics set by it are still being used by other console shooters. So why not return to the inspirer of them all? All in all, you\\'ll come out wondering why you missed it in the first place. I certainly did.',\n",

       "  'description': 'I didn’t really intend to pick this game up since I never really gotten into the whole battlefield franchise type of game after the first battlefield but after seeing some decent review scores and wanting something to play after completing MGS4 and GTA4 I decided to pick this game up and see was it worth it. What I would of really liked is if this game was on a PC as well as I do still prefer playing all fps based games with a keyboard and mouse unless there no choice but to play it on a console which is the case for Bad Company. To keep the explanation simple the story of the single player campaign is just about 4 soldiers sent out to do what their mission objectives are but eventually go rebel when they find something more worthwhile to pursue than their orders given, From then on the story unfold though checkpoints after checkpoints.  The Gameplay of BF:Bad Company is a decent shooter having a variety of weapons that you find throughout the single player campaign. There were however several things that I didn’t like about the gameplay. Starting straight out on the hardest difficulty the enemy pretty much shoot you before they see you most of the time and majority of the fight you end up mostly hiding and using the health needle over and over whenever it has recharge. When you get killed in single player you just respawn back to the last checkpoint and most of the time that is miles away from where you are and it lead to you having to always run long stretches just to get back to where u got killed. Lastly this is not really a problem but more of a laugh, the amount of exploding barrel and creates around the area pretty much makes it obvious that the developers want to show off there game engine with the new destructible environments but I did find it a bit excessive use of exploding objects in the game, so much that I pretty much spend most of the time aiming and shooting them all just to see what explodes next to it.  Graphics using their ‘Frostbite Engine’ where nicely done running smooth on 720p, however it pretty obvious there is a slight hazy look to the game which I’m not sure if it was place in on purpose like a film grain that is similar to what ‘Mass Effect’ did.  Apart from that the rest of the details where nicely done.  The Sound of the game was amazing especially running it though a home theatre setup. You can practically hear every bullet flying pass and hitting walls, debris falling all around you thought the destructible environment and hearing the sound change depending on where you are at the time of the action that occurred. The sound is very different from what any other game has done and deserves credit for that.  Getting pass the single player aspect of the game and jumping into the multiplayer section of the game is where this game is really intended to be enjoyed in the long run. The leveling system can be very addictive as you always want to just continue to play just to get another point to grab a new piece of equipment and then just wanting to play more to get the next piece of equipment. There only one mode called ‘Gold Rush’ at the moment but there will be another mode coming soon but this mode alone is already good due the amount of variety in the game, being able to level up and get new equipment while having a different classes to choose from can keep players into the multiplayer of BF:BC.  Overall this game is well worth grabbing. The single player story is good with some minor gameplay frustration but I assume can be easily overcome if you put it on normal or easy difficulty setting and rush though it for the story.

       "  'description': \"This game presents a fairly extraordinary atmosphere, but one you loathe by the end. It is claustrophobic, oppressive and bleak, informed by a body of literature headed by Ayn Rand and other pioneers of the dystopian metropolis. The effort and detail is remarkable, but the game ends on a rather undecided note. It feels like is begins to construct something sizable, rich and diverse, but concentrates so single-mindedly on building up an overwhelming atmosphere that the conclusion feels almost like an afterthought.I played through the PC version, initially on a low-spec computer. Without the graphical bells and whistles, the story elements stand out strongly. This seems odd, as the story itself is one of fragments as various inhabitants of Rapture (the game's underwater setting) log their own personal concerns, fears, loves and hates in voice recordings. This is an effective conceit, bolstered by the steady stream of radio transmissions from the game's main characters. It's a good thing that the game promotes exploration, as loot and cash are always scarce; some of the audio recordings are quite obscure. To this extent, the game's objective indicator strips back a little bit of the immersion, but I didn't find it too much of a problem.This feels like a title which didn't quite deliver on expectations, in spite of its phenomenal presentation values and sound mechanics. And ultimately, it is unrelenting in its darkness. The setting is bleak and dystopian, and whilst that is done extremely well, it sometimes leaves a sour taste in the mouth. This is one game I had to play in quite a number of sittings, as sometimes that atmosphere becomes a little too intense.I still highly recommend that it be played, and more than once. It requires patience, a desire to explore, and a tolerance for violence and questionable morals - but it is a memorable, meaningful piece of electronic entertainment.\",\n",

This game is just so funny to just look at and the animations are good too. I would not go into detail because you have to experience the fun yourself before you believe it.  The sounds are really good except when the soldier shoots his rocket gun its the same sound all over again and again. Though, beside that, the sound is really good. If you make a 5-kill spree your character would laugh so much. Its just so hilarious. Every thing you do that there is good going you character would do something.  I have been playing this game really much and if I get tired of it in about 1 month time, I will for sure return again just for the fun because it is just so good and holds such a long time and of course that is not bad at all.

       "  'description': 'Okami could very well be the game that settles the debate whether or not video games should be considered art. It\\'s hard to not be enthralled by its lush, flowing colours, breath-taking art design and highly stylized scenery and characters. It would be unfair to reduce the game to simply being \"pretty\" however, as the underlying gameplay, while very reminiscent of Nintendo\\'s Legend of Zelda series, is just as superb and the distinctly Japanese setting sets it apart from anything else out there.  Incidentally, you play as Amaterasu, the Goddess of the Sun, re-incarnated in Nippon in the form of a white wolf by the tree spirit Sakuya to battle the evil demon Orochi. Amaterasu had already defeated the 8-headed snake and vanished thereafter, but it seems someone resurrected the legendary evil exactly 100 years after its demise, corrupting most of Nippon in the process. Joining in for the ride is Issun, a tiny, bug-sized man, claiming to be the greatest artist who ever lived. Since the celestial wolf is unable to talk, Issun is of course a welcomed guest on your journey to converse with the various villagers and travelers you\\'ll meet on your path. The story is indeed quite entertaining, filled with surprising twists and lovable characters. It\\'s also a surprisingly long adventure that can easily last you for 30-35 hours and even longer if you\\'re inclined to do many of the game\\'s sidequests netting in unlockable content like artworks, music tracks and powerful items for a new game+ retry.  As mentioned, the gameplay borrows many elements from Link\\'s adventures in Hyrule, but the experience is more streamlined and you\\'ll rarely feel a distinct separation between a dungeon environment and an \"overworld\". Instead you\\'ll be constantly cleansing the nature of an evil darkness that has befallen the land, uncovering new areas in the process, helping the people of Nippon with their problems, eventually uncovering who is behind all the mayhem going on. Naturally, Amaterasu, or Ammy as Issun likes to call our doggy heroine, will encounter many evil underlings trying to stop her and while there is a big variety of demons, often requiring specific strategies, combat is for the most part overly easy and can soon become more of an annoyance than anything else. Luckily, you can try to avoid most battles by keeping your distance to the hovering scrolls, representing mobs of monsters, trapping you in a small arena over the course of the fight, however the rewards from besting foes can give you access to a number of very handy items later on.  Aside from conventional weapons, of which you can equip a main and a sub weapon for a number of different playing styles, Amaterasu is also capable of drawing miracles into the world using the celestial brush. Holding R1 projects the world onto a canvas on which you can draw various patterns for different effects, a technique working surprisingly well and becoming very intuitive after only a few tries. The process is context-sensitive as well, drawing a circle onto the night time sky for example, will bring forth the sun, while the same symbol drawn onto a water surface will create a lily pad for Ammy to savely cross rivers and seas. These techniques figure into many of the game\\'s puzzles and are often required to proceed to new areas. They also figure prominently into the game\\'s boss battles which often need you to follow specific tactical use of newly learned brush moves in order to defeat them. All in all, you\\'ll find 13 different techniques throughout the course of the game, some of which can even be extended by doing optional questing.  The technical aspects of the game are undoubtedly overshadowed by its art design as both the visuals and audio are mesmerizingly beautiful in their composition. The soundtrack consists of numerous pieces, covering every layer of the game, from dark, mysterious tunes of unsettling dungeons to pompous ballads when roaming over the plains of Nippon and fitting themes for every major character. Disappointing however is the complete lack of voice acting throughout the game. Instead, you\\'ll have to click through dialogues underlaid with squeaky pseudo voice acting, somewhat similar to the technique used for the King of All Cosmos in Katamari Damacy. At least the \"voices\" were chosen carefully and each character has a distinct voice. The graphics can be criticized along those same lines as objects of importance like treasure chests will often fade in when you almost ran past them and the camera, while offering two zoom distances, can be rather troublesome, especially indoors, making some brush puzzles trickier than they needed to be as you have to figure out how to get the desired perspective onto the canvas.  All told though, Okami is a fantastic game, incorporating many of the genre\\'s best aspects in near perfection, offering a unique setting and compelling story wrapped in an outstanding presentation.',\n",

Introducing us to two of the most fun and likeable gaming characters from the N64 days, the game's story while not as strong as it could have been lends itself to an amazing selection of colourful worlds, fun challenges and a great deal of items to collect. Level design is topnotch and although none of the characters speak properly, there is a certain charm to them. Interesting bosses also help to further the game towards its entertaining finale.

       "  'description': 'Call of Duty 4 is definitely an epic game. Epic Single-player, epic multi-player, epic graphics, epic voice acting and so on.  Its not just a normal casual shooter, it stands out in its own way and it really feels good to sit down and play it. The only thing thats sad is that the Single-player is really short, maybe 4-5 hours for a normal first person shooter gamer, but you want to play it over again, just to see the awesome thing happening again. Now into more detail:  Graphics: In graphics, this game looks good even on 640 x 420 and on the highest quality in all, its like a movie with real actors, and you\\'re one of them. Every single thing in this game is textured in such a great way, that it looks like the developers have used 1 week on each item if not more. Every character are having the best looks that just put\\'s them out and you remember them. For example, the character called Captain Price, I will for sure remember him for the next couple of years, because his look and voice acting is just so solid, and his movements are so well animated too, and because of all these things combined together, it just makes this game so good to looks at!  Sound: Sounds, sounds, sounds, they are awesome. Each weapon, character and action have their own voices, or sounds (There is over 30 weapons and over 25 different characters) Imagine you have to import all of them voices and sounds in to a game and they have to be top notch quality. These guys/girls did an awesome job in this and just the sounds and graphics combined, you want to buy the game. Well, I would.  Gameplay: The gameplay in this game is epic, EPIC I tell you! Even though you complete the game once, you want to complete it again, and again, and again. Then when you\\'ve completed it several times, there is the EPIC multi-player. Unlike the other Call of Duty games, that had a horrible multi-player, in this game, the multi-player is as good as the single-player, if not better because at day 1 they had 2 teams, a single-player development and a multi-player development team. The other Call of Duty games they had one development team to do it all, so now, its quality work! Its like Battlefield 2. You start at level one, and each thing you do gives you experience, from killing players to planting the bomb. Then you gain levels and each 2 level you should advance in rank. Like Private and Corporal, then you should get new weapons and stuff. And when you for example kill 100 players with an M4A1, also known as colt, you get a new camouflage to your weapons to make it looks cooler. You also gain new equipment to your weapons and things like that. You also unlock perks. Now, perks are like super powers. Some may do so you can sprint for a longer period of time or, you might even get one so you can hold 4 special granades instead of one. You can have 3 on you at once and you can change in the create class menu. The create class is where you add weapons, camouflage and perks to your different classes that you have created yourself. And as you may see, the multi-player have lots and lots of stuff to unlock, and the good thing is that a level 1 game easily kill a level 55, (Which is the highest level) because the level 55 is not better than him because of all the stuff he have. He just have more things to juggle his character with.  Storyline: At first the storyline may seem confusing, but as you play, you get more information about the main storyline and it becomes more intense. This game is actually the most evil one to date, because instead of the second world war, you have modern war. In Iraq and stuff. But this storyline is about nuclear weapons and how the military will cope with that and its just so intense and you really get into the game. Then at the end of the storyline, all the loose ends get together and you just sit and watch the final cutscene with your mouth open thinking: \"Wow!\"  So overall this a really good game that anyone could enjoy if they are in to first person shooters.

       "  'description': 'Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence is the \"Director\\'s Cut\", if you will, of the already amazing and critically acclaimed 2004 release, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. If you\\'ve spent any amount of time with Snake Eater then you already know what an incredible experience that game can provide. So, you may find yourself asking, \"How can Snake Eater possibly have been improved?\". I\\'m here to provide you with that and answer and more.One of the things that made Snake Eater so fresh and reinvigorating for the MGS series was the change in setting. The previous games in the series took place in the not too distant future. Not only that, they always had the main character, Solid Snake, infiltrating a military base of some sort or the like. Snake Eater on the other hand took the series into the thick and lush jungles of the 1960\\'s era Soviet Union. This slight shift in setting brought all new gameplay options to the table. Gone is the Soliton Radar System of the previous games, which lets Snake see where enemy sentries are at any given time, and their field of vision. To replace that, in Snake Eater, Snake has access to several gadgets, sonar etc., which used together grant the same effect. Though, it\\'s much tricker to pin down an enemies exact location as you can only have one device equipped at a time. Snake Eater also brings the Camouflage System. While in the field Snake has access to different sets of camouflage which grant varying degrees of cover to Snake depending on his surroundings. If Snake can match his Camo closely to his surrounding he can appear almost invisible to most enemies in the game. Snake Eater also adds another another innovation to the series via the Survival Viewer. Using this sub-menu, Snake can perform small medical procedures on himself. Things such as setting a broken bone or removing leeches picked up while walking through a swamp. He can also eat one of the many animals he may have captured or killed while in the field to regain lost stamina.Through all these innovations Snake Eater missed one mark. Snake Eater retained the same camera as previous games in the MGS series. In the jungle setting of Snake Eater this camera becomes problematic. The organic nature of the environment made it difficult to clearly view the action. Herein lies the really the only improvement that could have been made to Snake Eater. With the release of Subsistence the camera has been changed dramatically. For the first time in the MGS series, the camera is now fully controlled by the player. After spending just the first few minutes playing Subsistence is becomes clear just how dramatically this affects gameplay. On the one hand, the game seems just a bit easier because of it. But honestly, it really isn\\'t. It\\'s actually more fun. The camera does exactly what a camera should now, and thats to give the player a clear view of what is happening on screen. Stalking enemies is so much more fun now than it ever was before , all thanks to the addition of a simple player controlled camera.The camera isn\\'t all that has been added, though. The second disc of this package, called Persistence, contains ports of the original MSX versions of Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake\\'. This disc also contains the long awaited and anticipated online mode of Metal Gear Solid. Metal Gear Online, as it\\'s been dubbed by fans, is worth the price of admission alone. There are several game types to choose from including, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, a Capture the Flag game, as well as Sneaking Mission which pits one player, as Snake, against the other seven. This mission type is probably my personal favorite. The controls in the online mode are basically the same as the single player game. So, Metal Gear fans should have no trouble jumping in and taking part in the action.The only thing Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence has against it, is the exact same criticism that has been tossed at the rest of the games in the series. That is that the cutscenes and conversations over Snakes Codec, a device he uses to communicate with his mission commanders, can be extremely long winded. The first 20-30 minutes of the game are mostly spent watching cutscenes and listening to people talk. This doesn\\'t bother me personally, but I have known some to completely write off this series for that alone. If you\\'re like me however and love a good story in your games, then you will be blown away. The story contained here in incredibly intricate. Though it starts slow, it slowly builds to breakneck pace and doesn\\'t let up until its over.Metal Gear Solid 3:Subsitence delivers on all fronts. Contained here is an amazing single player experience, an easy to pick and play online mode, and plenty of other extras to keep you busy for a long while. Regardless if you\\'re a fan of the Metal Gear Series or not, this is one videogame you owe it to yourself to experience. ',\n",

       "  'description': 'Madden NFL 07 is the latest version of the long running Madden franchise from developer Electronic Arts. The past few years Madden has started to become stale. In my mind though, this version has revitalized the franchise with amazing gameplay.The gameplay in Madden NFL 07 for the Wii is extremely intuitive. If you are still having trouble, it has a great tutorial mode that teaches you everything. You actually throw in this game. It feels awesome. All you have to do is hold down the button of the receiver and make a forward motion with the Wii remote. While you are running, you can either stiff arm or juke with either the Wii remote or nunchuck, respectively, by making a motion to the left or right side depending on which way you want the move to go. It just feels so satisfying to actually feel like you are throwing the ball or kicking the ball. One thing that is kind of annoying is when you are trying to select a certain player with the cursor from the Wii remote. It is very touchy and the cursor kind of jolts to other places randomly sometimes. Although this really isn\\'t really a detriment to the gameplay, it is a little irritating. Another thing is the big hit system. In order to do a big hit in any other version of the game, you use the right analog stick to pull off a big hit. On Wii though, you don\\'t have two thumbsticks. So to perform it, you have to hold down the Z button and thrust the nunchuck and Wii remote towards the screen which doesn\\'t feel very natural and is actually difficult to actually come up with a successful big hit. Annoying minor issues aside Madden NFL 07 for Wii has the best gameplay of any Madden to date. The graphics in Madden are a different story. These are slightly higher resolution than Gamecube, but not by very much. This is probably the biggest drawback of the game by far. It is a launch game, and we still don\\'t know what the complete power of the system looks like, but hopefully in the future they will improve the graphics. The animations are really good though, but the main problem is the graphics engine.The sound is typical Madden. You have John Madden and Al Michaels at the helm commentating. They need to get some new lines though. Their lines are getting kind of old. If you want good Madden commentary, go to Madden 64 for the N64. Incredible lines from John Madden. The sound that comes out of the Wii remote though sound kind of cheap. Overall the sound is the same sound from the other \"last-gen\" versions.Madden has the same Superstar, franchise, and play now modes we all know and love, but exclusive to the Wii version are three new mini-games. There is a two on two mini-game where there are two offensive players and two defensive players. Another one is YAC or Yards After Catch where the point is to catch the ball and gain as many yards after you catch it as possible. When you are on defense you have to try and swat the ball and stop the receiver. The last one is the Kicking Combine. This is probably the least fun, because sometimes it says you will slice the ball when your wrist is perfectly straight. Madden for Wii is worth the money.Overall, Madden for Wii is the best playing Madden ever. If you don\\'t care solely about graphics and you have an open mind to innovation you absolutely cannot go wrong with Madden NFL 07 for the Nintendo Wii.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Counter-strike has been, and probably always will be, one of the most popular online first-person shooters available (Phew, got that said). Now that I got that out of the way, I can talk about the game. For those who have never played Counter-strike before, it is a round-based shooter with emphasis on staying alive and teamwork. Each round you are basically given one life, and some cash. That cash is used to buy weapons and equipment to kill the opposing team. Counter-strike Source plays with two teams: the terrorists and counter-terrorists. The terrorists are given the objective to plant a bomb in a set location or defend the hostages from rescue, while the counter-terrorists are tasked with defusing the bomb or rescuing the hostages. It is pretty straight forward, however, there are many aspects that set it apart from most other military shooters. For instance, the snipers, assault rifles, sub-machine guns, and other weapons each have their own feel and recoil. In this way, each weapon feels very different and controls very different from other guns. The game is also very fast paced, and action packed with an emphasis on head-shots. Counter-strike source features amazing graphics and sound. Each weapon looks and sound like it packs a punch. The player models and maps also look fantastic. Also, for the first time ever, Counter-strike Source adds in Valve's new source engine which adds realistic physics to the maps and models. So, in some cases players will see bodies explode into the air, tumble as they die off of cliffs, or even use the engine to their advantage via barrels and other entities. Counter-strike Source does not have a singleplayer campaign or story mode as the game is heavily a multiplayer game. Instead, the game offers AI bots that are playable on any map for practice or to fill in for human opponents when there aren't enough. The bots are fairly smart and can adapt to most maps they are placed on. In fact, bots can even adapt to user-made maps via automatic navigation path creation. Overall, the bots are very fun to play against, but multiplayer is where they game truly shines. Counter-strike is also a very customizable game. There are mod tools provided by Valve that allow users to create their own player models, maps, weapon models, and even gameplay modes. Some popular modes include: deathmatch, zombie, and warcraft 3. These modes are easy to get into as players do not have to exit the game to download them. They are already installed on the server so players do not have to install them manually. Thousands of user-made maps are already available, and more are always popping up every minute. Each mod and map add a little more to do in Counter-strike Source, making it that much better.If you are looking for a fast-paced, military, team, round-based shooter that can be enjoyed for years, Counter-strike Source will surely satisfy you. There are always thousands of players online with 400-500 servers running constantly, so finding a game is only hard if you're picky. The game is lots of fun and the phenomenon that is Counter-strike should be experienced by everyone at least once. \",\n",

       "  'description': '\\xa0Many people criticized that they are just millions of World War II theme, first person shooters depicting it as just a cheap way to produce games or just being too repetitive in the gaming industry so far. But it seems to be in the logic that these games don\\'t have to be the category of the genre to be enjoyable to all. Other people seems annoyed of this whole fiasco about this theme implemented into a game that will be introduced additionally later but much of the fiasco is for ripping people off of their buck so that they could play a really dull game. The whole entirely of this World War II, is that they keep on repeat itself for the past years to date. At first glance, it seems that it rather not be annoying but to try to enjoy the game without the annoyance of the theme. While some will disagree about the lack of non-World War II theme shooters, some just are there to enjoy the game to its extent.  While they aren\\'t World War I shooters in the market, which in fact they should do, much because the gaming industry avoid the least popular war which started it all and rather go the one where this war has plenty of battles to witness. Its not really intriguing to see another World War II shooter in the market but its enjoyable to see how new the formula is and not be the same dull shooter like the rest of the industry does. Most World War II theme shooters go after the same battle that copied from another game but somehow made to different to fool the player but some games often doesn\\'t. Like for instance, Medal of Honour, has some games that have the same wars as the other games have. Most of the time, games has tons of moments from movies, often from such movies as Saving Private Ryan or Enemy at the Gates. Which to that entirely, its doesn\\'t look satisfying to see because you have already seen it in the movies and playing that game with that key moment makes you feel not great. The Playstation Portable\\'s variety of games aren\\'t that great. Most of the games produced for this handheld console are mostly third party games which the developers produced so they could get a buck more. While the variety of games that aren\\'t third-party are in high demand, genres such like First Person Shooters deserve to be in this handheld console. After the release of the Playstation Portable, and a year ahead, we see more exciting games such as Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror and Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories, its just nice that the industry has a pint of respect of this handheld console to make such great games on the go for it.  The Medal of Honor series is one of the victims of this ongoing production of World War II theme shooters. It was first a developed by 2142 which made an amazing game called Medal of Honor: Allied Assault that is commonly known to all and some would agree that this is the best Medal of Honor game. Then EA purchase the rights to it and took this gaming series to the wrong turn because EA games are just decent but not excellent. Many would complaint that Medal of Honor games are released every single year and gives a less-satisfying result of how great games could be. When EA purchased this company, they concluded that they would produced Medal of Honor games for all consoles making the Medal of Honor series feel like a Third Party series. Which in fact is seems like a partially good idea but most of the time, when EA introduced the game into a handheld, it tends to a complete failure. Until Finally, EA Canada reveals Medal of Honor: Heroes for the Playstation Portable which crafted a game with such richness and visceral action as you expected for the Playstation Portable to date. In Heroes, you play a multitude of different heroes in each perceptive campaign. Each individual soldier has its own story, whom have appeared in previous Medal of Honor games. The story unfolds short, narrated by black-and-white movie clips directed from World War II, and orders are doled out via typewritten memos. Each soldier has its own campaign divided up by five missions perceptively, for a grand total of 15 in the game. You first play as Sergeant John Barker (Medal of Honor: Allied Assault) whom find himself stationed in Italy. His objectives are simple, you must capture the enigma engine, liberate some territory and more.. Lieutenant James Patterson (Medal of Honor and Medal of Honor: Frontline) is stationed in the Netherlands, the narration depicted him as \"one of the best.\" Where you are required to steal important document papers and retake and liberate the crucial areas from the Germans. The last five missions follows the exploits of Lieutenant William Holt (Medal of Honor: European Assault) in Belgium. Here you\"ll be entrust with to capture and hold a river base, recover lost documents, kill a bunch of soldiers and finally, destroy the German command center.  In the game, it seems quite a bored mainly because, there aren\\'t any interaction while processing in the game, all you hear, is taunts, and the same short voice acts, they could muster. Which makes the feeling less satisfying to players who want a game that have the decency to add character interaction. All you do is just shoot dudes in the face and that\\'s about it like some restless grunt. The voice acting in this game is no where to be found. You will only hear two to three voice actors in the game: the gruff voice of the narrator, the soldiers and the opposing side, both the Allies and the Axis has the same dialogue but in different language. While its just another lame excuse for a dull story in the game, this game is just like I said, shoot dudes and blow up stuff. Its pretty self explanatory, as you unravel to the depths of Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands to crush the Nazi, hearing the same voice text over and over again, making you just irritant on whats going on. The control scheme is simplistic and intuitive, despite not having a second analog stick attached on the Playstation Portable, which in fact makes the gameplay, much better. In fact, the controls in the game has its merits, although at first, you might stumble confusedly around the controls, you will soon get used to it. You will be able to control the camera perceptive with the controls which makes it less appealing to others because the lack of an second analog stick which makes you confused with the control scheme at the start. As for the rest, like switching weapons to crawling, its quite similar to Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror which in fact has the similar scheme as this game. The directional keys of your Playstation Portable are planned out are your sprinting, switching weapons and crawling to make it less satisfying to use any other control scheme. You will be able to switch different control scheme in this game, either commando or by the default mode, each of them has your style of how you want to control the game. As for as the shooting goes, its pretty much the same, both of the triggers serves a purpose to aim and shoot. Its pretty self explanatory to first person shooter veterans and gamers alike. As for its faults, sometimes the camera view tend to be quite slow on the turning, making you die or lose a lot of your health during the process. Aside from sprinting, if an approaching grenade is going to blow you up, you can the use key to kick the grenade, similarity to Allied Assault. The use key can is usable in situations like trying to kick grenades or for certain missions, either for blowing up something or to defuse something. As far as the gameplay goes, it has its merits. Similar to other first person shooters, or specifically in the Medal of Honour series, you will be confronted with only Nazis throughout the whole game. But as far as anything goes, you will be only facing foot soldiers and not things like tanks or any sort of artillery you happen upon. Sometimes, you might think in the loading screen, there are armour vehicles in this game but those are for environmental purposes and not for climbing into one and causing havoc. Its just ridiculous to kill the same Nazis, over and over again making the game just boring. Its like facing hordes of Nazi clones whom are trying to come to you in a straight direction appending doom upon you.  The story is printed through typewritten memos, as you are given the objective. The typewritten memos is a interesting idea, to compensate how boring this game is without the voice overs. The storyline are first told by the black-and-white cutscenes and then by these typewritten memos ,telling you more information to obtaining the objective. In Heroes, the objectives split into two categories, the main objectives and the secondary objectives. The main objectives is the ones to complete the level to progress further into the next mission and the secondary missions are just optional but provide to benefit your mission efficiency, which tallies after the mission is completed or failed.  The scenario of this game is split into three different campaigns, first Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium which in fact makes me thrilled because the lack of Italy campaigns out there in the World War II FPS genre. In three different campaign, there will be four or five missions in each of them, stretching out four or five hours in total. Each mission can be finished less than a hour. While this could be easy for on-the-go activities, it could be annoying sometimes. The missions can be signify as red flags as Nazi territory, but after you completed that specific mission, the flag, that you managed to complete turns to green and you could still play it for mission efficiency to further your tally.  The objectives in the game is easy to compete, so there is no pressure to obtain it. While the game has a time put out there to how much you are playing, you could still manage to beat it in that time without any stress put into you. The main objectives consists mostly of capturing and holding flags to blowing up machines, and sometimes you are required to obtain certain documents but that\\'s about it, it could be really repetitive in the end, trying to capture a flag while Nazi opponents are shooting you or blowing up something. The secondary objectives are pretty much self explanatory, as you are require to obtain certain documents. Which makes both the main and secondary objectives, similar to each other and just annoying to finish.  In Heroes, you will be able to control a group of three or four allied soldiers, but you can\\'t control their movements nor tell them to attack at the opportune time. They just follow you, or try to follow you, everywhere you go and attack if there is a threat by. They often, form up to formation to protect your live. Each soldier in the game has the same gun as you progress further in the game, and like other FPS out there, they all have infinite ammo or something. Every-time, one of your teammates die, a new recruit will be enlist to reinforce your position, it seems like there are endless amounts of recruits, in particular situations. Sometimes in further missions, you are on your own but it makes it a bit better because they can easily die in situations. You could be able to pick up weapons on the field, similar to other FPS out there but not much by the opposition, as sometimes they either drop health packs, ammo and sometimes weapons. Weapons and medical kits are scattered all around the battlefield. The weapons are similar to other WWII FPS out there, as you could get a sniper rifle to a bazooka to a shotgun. Ammunition is easy to get in this game, as you kill a Nazi, you could obtain ammo to replenish your gun. Medical kits are also scattered across the battlefield, sometimes they could even led to your objective.  Like its predecessor, your interface has a compass to direct you where to go, as it indicates a directional arrow either yellow for main objectives or blue arrows for secondary objectives. When you come closer to your objective, the arrow changes to a yellow or blue dot to show that you are close to your objective. This is quite a intriguing tool unlike other FPS out there. Aside from the objectives, you could also see where are your allies are, as displayed in green dots in your compass. Furthermore you could see when a grenade is coming to your position indicated by a yellow-like target so you could run to avoid that explosive or attempt to kick that grenade away so that you could see it fly across your compass screen. The Artificial Intelligence is just plain dumb, despite the difficulty you progressed in the game. The deal with these dumb-minded fools is that they just come straight to you without using cover, sometimes they retreat, flak you but despite all these attempts of conquering you, Its just the same strategy over and over again, all they do initially is come straight at you, and try to kill you and your teammates. The Nazis as well as your teammates, sometimes use grenades to try to flush each opposition out, as displayed a indicator in your compass to see when the opposition is throwing a grenade. The fact they added a difficulty setting is not to think that you can master the game in the hardest difficulty but to survive the stupidity of the AI coming to you and taking you down. The difficulty setting is just a increased of damaged taken and more Nazi reinforcements. The moral is the hardest the difficulty is, the more fun to compensate the tedious gameplay, this game offers. After you completing a mission, you get a mission efficiency screen which tells you if you completed that objective or not, failed or success. Like I said, the secondary objectives doesn\\'t matter but it could be a replay-ability to others, otherwise, it also shows your efficiency that you excess through the game, to completing both the main and secondary objectives to how good your accuracy is in each perspective missions. Then it awards you with new costumes to unlock in the skirmish, depending on how much you killed to completing the campaign. Then when it tallies all up, and tells you if you did good or not by medals. Each medal indicates how are efficient in the course of your mission.  Furthermore as missions progressed, there are a ranking system, and in each mission you can get more experience towards your rankings to rank up to the next rank. You begin as a Private and as the game, progresses, you can get up to Sergeant, Lieutenant to Captain. The ranking system, really doesn\\'t matter but it just shows, what position of rank, you are. Of course, awards will be handled out to you, depending of what you have done, like for instance: killing fifty enemies to see how much headshots you did to completing the campaign. It\\'s just there to show off and it feels much like an achievement system implemented into it to congratulate you for the actions you, part-take.  Plus, In Heroes, there are a option, to replay those black-and-white cut-scenes, if you have finished a certain campaign. There are four black-and-white cut-scenes in total. The cut-scenes seemed pretty nice and pretty well executed. The Medal of Honor has always been, a hallmark for those awesome cut-scenes and excellent narration but the word \"troop\" associated to this game, kind of stole the whole show for me, as I despise that word. The cut-scenes are generally from the archieves from World War II real footage with an additional of the wonderful narration, from a gruffly voice actor whose telling, whats the lowdown. There are also extras in the game, one of them is a preview to \"Need for Speed\" for this handheld, which is generally a short one but not that satisfying.  There are also a skirmish mode, playable in Heroes. It is just like any other skirmishes out there in the world of FPS. Basically there are only two skirmish modes, Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch, both of them seemed quite great depending on if you like them. Deathmatch is like a Free-For-All which the objective is that you must kill others out there whom are killing other computer generic AI to score points or kills per-say. You can chose the option is set the time for each individual match as well as how much bots, you wanted to have, and a map suitable for the purpose. But first, you can only chose a map and required to unlock more additional maps in the single player campaign. Which makes sense. After you have chosen these options, you can chose either the Nazi side or the Allies side, each of them doesn\\'t matter or have any effect on them. Also, you could chose, what costume you preferred, if you have unlocked them in the single player and a preferable weapon of chose. Ranging from Shotgun, Thompson to M1 Grande. Team-Deathmatch, however is a skrimish which pits you and your allies against the opponent, similar to Deathmatch, the objective is kill the opponent before it kills you. You just chose what faction you preferred and stuff and you are on your way. At the end, the victor (you of course) with the most points will be awarded with a medal depending on how good you are on that match. Aside from the skirmish, there are also, a online multiplayer which you can join, if you register to the EA Nation or whatever name it is. Like any EA Nation online, there is a lobby which you could interact with other real-life players using the Playstation interface and also play against them. In the Lobby, you could create a game or join a game, creating a game is similar to the skirmish factor which you could pick any map, you desire as well as the desire time and wait for the players to game. Join a game, is similar but someone else is picking the map and the time for their desire. Pretty self-explanatory. Like any other online shooters out there, when creating or joining the game, you or the owner of that match can moderate and kick any players, they desire and also while you are in the battlefield. There are a ping system which signafities like other online shooter, how are your ping is, if you ping increases, you get lagged out or kicked out, if the owner of that game is pissed. There are also a friends list in the game, which you could add any user online, if you like them, and is their choice to accept that request. There are also ladder matches which you could see, the experienced players, and try to challenged them in a match. Like the single player, everytime you joined a game, at the end of the game, you could go offline and see the results of your accuracy, time and what part of the body you did most killed at.  At the end, Heroes isn\\'t quite an good addition to the Medal of Honor franchise but it is just pretty fun, if you want to have this on-the-go playability. The replayability as well as the online will satisfy you, if you like to play it on-the-go. The endless amounts of killing and ranking is pretty satisfactary but still offers some major improvements to this franchise. Depsite the unintelligent AI, short campaign and the boring maps, Heroes is pretty good on making you have a good time if you enjoyed it. As for the game, you should only rent this game but not purchase, well purchase this if the price goes low or buy a used copy of this game because it really does have its full potential on this game. Its satisfing, yes but the excutation is quite as good as other Medal of Honor games out there.',\n",

       " {'deck': 'Rock Band Review',\n",
       "  'description': 'Rock Band is the newest game from Harmonix, who previously made the Guitar Hero games. This time, though, you can also sing and play drums.\\xa0You play guitar and bass mostly the same as in Guitar Hero. You have a mini-guitar with five colored buttons. One green, one red, one yellow, one blue, and one orange. On Easy, you only use the green, red, and yellow buttons. On Medium, you use the green, red, yellow, and blue buttons. On Hard and Expert, you use all of them. As the colored note scrolls down the screen, you press that color and press the strum bar. Sometimes you will have to press more than one at the same time or you will have to hold the button down. For the latter, you can use the Whammy-Bar to change how it sounds. You use Overdrive, (This games version of Star Power,) by tilting the guitar. There are a few differences though. You can get higher multipliers with Bass Groove while playing bass. Also, the guitar has lower frets that you can use to play solos without strumming. Hammer-ons and pull-offs show up as smaller notes now. As a side note, the guitars aren\\'t that well made and sometimes don\\'t work like they should. Also the guitar parts seem much easier compared to Guitar Hero.\\xa0The drums have four pads and a kick pedal. The notes also come scrolling down at you like the guitar. But instead of showing up as a square note, the kick pedal note shows up as an orange line across the screen. You use everything on every difficulty. Drums are easily the hardest part of the game. You activate Overdrive by playing the cymbol, (The green pad,) at the end of Drum Fills. These show up at pre-determined parts of the song. Which means that you can\\'t activate it whenever you want, which is stupid in my opinion.\\xa0When you sing, the lyrics move across the screen, with a pitch meter above it. The closer you get to the pitch, the more points you get. As the difficulty goes up, the more sensitive the microphone gets. You activate Overdrive by singing whatever you want during glowing parts of the song. Like the drums\\' drum fills, these only happen during pre-determined parts of the song so you can\\'t activate it whenever you want. I think this is stupid too.\\xa0Each instrument, (Except the bass,) has its own \"Solo Tour\" mode. The best mode, however, is the multi-player \"Band World Tour\" mode. In this mode, you and whoever your playing with star off as a small band, playing in small clubs and bars. You continue to play and get money, fans, and ways of transportation and eventually become a world famous band playing in huge stadiums, theaters, etc. This, however, can\\'t be played online. There are also competitive multi-player modes, Score Duel and Tug of War. As well as both Solo and Multi-player quick play. These multiplayer modes can be played online.\\xa0As with any Music game, it would fail if it didn\\'t have a good song list. And Rock Band has a great one. Some of the songs include \"Creep,\" \"In Bloom,\" \"Enter Sandman,\" \"Foreplay/Longtime,\" \"Learn to Fly,\" and \"Go With the Flow.\" There are also dozens of songs available for download on Xbox Live, with more added every Tuesday. Some of these songs include \"El Scorcho,\" \"I Fought the Law,\" \"Gimme Three Steps,\" and \"Still Alive,\" from Portal.\\xa0You can create your own characters. You can choose everything from their clothes, to their style, to their eye color, etc. The game also has good graphics.\\xa0The value depends of Rock Band depends on how much you like rock music. If you love rock music and are a gamer like me,then I recommend it. If you are a casual gamer or don\\'t really like rock music, then you might be better off with Guitar Hero.\\xa0',\n",

       "  'description': \"CoD4 is by far the best shooter on the Xbox 360, and it achieves this high mark by delivering the most amazing action sequences a game of its type has yet to reproduce.   Let alone that it's an incredible good looking and well sounding game. It manages to bridge people who just like to shoot things in a video game to people that are looking for an intense and meaningful storyline that makes you feel as your really making a difference out in the battlefield. I think the reason why this is such a popular game is that it doesn't ask too much from the player, other than a good and steady trigger finger. There are no squad commands for example, and to be honest it doesn't need them because the AI from both sides are pretty good at what there supposed to do, if a grenade is dropped beside one of your allies, they will pick it up and trough it back to the enemy, if there are targets hiding on rooftops or hidden behind windows, they call them out. It's stuff like these that make CoD4 such an outstanding shooter. Missions were you man the fire power of an AC-130 and when you take a long distance sniper shot really take the cake and become missions you want to do more than once. Witch is good, because the single player is a bit on the short side, clocking in at 6-8 hours depending on the difficulty setting you decide to play it on.  I was also very surprised that the guns in the game are incredibly well realized. Not only are you toying with the most powerful hardware available military wise, but the sound, the feel, the minor rumble difference when firing a suppressed gun from a AK 47, to a MP5, to a helicopter minigun, it's all very believable and makes up for some memorable tight fire fights.  And this all comes to full effect in the multy-player mode, where there are over a dozen modes and maps to play around with, and millions of players that are mighty good at the game by now. It's ranking system is like what you may have seen in games like Battlefield 2, where your actions determine what your rewards will be, if you use an ak 47 for long periods of time and get those oh-so satisfying kills, you un-lock scopes, silencers, grenade barrel for that weapon... and that's just some examples, because you can also customize your character with perks, witch is like giving special abilities to your online soldier, you can have it drop a grenade when you die, to pull out your pistol when you die, you can have deeper bullet penetration when fighting people that stay behind walls and some more, sneaky ones, like the one that makes you invisible on the enemies radar. It's all very robust and very polished; chances are that you will fall in love with what the multy-player has to offer and be able to play it for months on end.  All in all, I could spend hours writing about why this is such an amazing game, but in truth, your experience is what matters, go ahead, buy it. It's a game that only gets better the more you play it. It just keeps on giving\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'Rainbow Six Vegas 2 improves upon its predecessor in many ways.',\n",
       "  'description': \"Rainbow Six Vegas 2 comes hot off the heels of its predecessor, Rainbow Six Vegas from late 2006. The first Vegas game was highly regarded as one of the better shooters of this generation with plenty of praise from critics and consumers all over. Does the sequel stack up? Yes, very much so.  Rainbow Six, as a series, has never been the benchmark for graphical power, and Vegas 2 is no exception. It doesn't necessarily look bad by any means, it's just nothing to gawk or drool at. As with most Unreal Engine 3 games, it has quite a bit of jarring pop-in textures. The character models look great and the environments are lush and full of life, showing off Sin City in every beautiful detail.  Thankfully, Vegas 2 controls wonderfully. Everything feels great, being able to pop off enemies with relative ease. Grenades are thrown with just a simple touch of a button, as is cover. To cover, just walk to a corner, press the L button and you are behind cover. From this angle, you can see enemies coming in order to give you the advantage, and you can also shoot from this angle, either by leaning out from cover, or blind fire.  The story of Vegas 2 can be quite confusing. It begins as a prequel to Rainbow Six 3, with Bishop at the helm heading to a science observatory in France. From then, it advances five years in the future to Las Vegas. There are plenty of twists and turns in the story that will keep you guessing what is going to happen next. Each of the characters has their own unique personality and traits to differentiate. You play as Bishop, the leader of the Rainbow team, along with Knight, Gabe and Logan.  The campaign can be played solo or online with one other player. Unlike Vegas 1, you can play the entire campaign online. The co-op is instantly accessible from the single player campaign. Whenever you need help, just invite a friend straight to your location and you've got instant assistance. The co-op is very much appreciated due to the AI of your squad mates having the mind and attention span of a drunken door knob.   While the campaign does nearly everything well, the meat of Vegas 2 is the multiplayer. Team Leader headlines the plethora of modes with plenty of variety. It allows for up to 14 players online, along with supporting a robust P.E.C. (Persistent Elite Creation) mode allowing you to customize your character with a lot of different equipment. Each kill awards XP, allowing players to rank their characters up for more equipment and camo. It should also be noted that this time around, XP is earned in every game mode, not just multi player. This allows for easier ranking to ease the grind.  P.E.C. is even more robust than Vegas 1. It has an 'ACES' (Advanced Combat Enhancement and Specialization) system with different rewards based on how you play. It is divided between Marksman, CQB, and Assault. Assault awards for explosive kills, CQB awards for close quarter combat, and Marksman awards for headshots and long range kills. The P.E.C. system, along with ACES makes the game very fun and addictive. I always want to come back for just one more game to get to the next rank.   The maps for Rainbow Six Vegas 2 are all highly detailed and well designed. Each one has its own unique playing style. In Villa, you're given more options as to how to play as it provides both a close quarter environment, and a long range environment. With a map like CQB Training, you're probably better off with a long range weapon like a Sniper Rifle or Assault Rifle. Having a good variety of excellent maps helps, and I can't single out one map that I don't enjoy.   In conclusion, Rainbow Six Vegas 2 is a great shooter. It compiles everything that was great in the first Vegas game, and improves on almost every level. The single player campaign can be completed within 10 hours, while the multiplayer will last quite a bit longer. The multiplayer alone, along with P.E.C., is worth the price of admission, and really pushes the limit of addictiveness.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Company of Heroes is a real-time strategy game from Relic during world war two as it follows the story of the American Airborne troops who dropped in over  during D-Day. Its single player campaign will take you all the way from the D-Day landings to chasing the last remaining Germans back into their homeland, and hunting down a notorious German tank commander. On the way you will pass through famous French towns such as Carentan and will be dropped deep behind enemy lines to destroy a V2 rocket factory, the action is intense and plentiful and these objective based missions are a fantastic way to get to know the game. Consisting of 15 missions, the campaign will take anywhere between 10 and 15 hours to complete depending on the objectives you undertake. In each mission you will be provided with one or more primary objectives which must be completed, coupled with optional secondary objectives and also a bonus objective, which, if completed will earn you a medal at the end of the mission. My only “annoyance” with the campaign, and I am really just nitpicking here, is the difficulty, or lack of it. I never really found myself being presented with too much of a challenge during these missions, however, it isn’t really too much of a problem since the sheer quality of the missions more than makes up for it. While the single player campaign can only be played from the American perspective, you can also play skirmishes on a variety of maps as either allies or axis. It is here, where the uniqueness of this game becomes apparent. The maps are split into territory sectors, all of which give a particular resource as well as increasing your food unit. Manpower is the basic resource required to create anything, Ammo is used for upgrades and using special abilities, and Fuel is used mostly for buildings and vehicles. Depending on the territory you control, the rate you receive more resources changes, the more you control, the more you collect. It’s a simple yet really compelling system as it creates areas in the map which turn into hot fighting zones due to resource nodes which both teams want furiously. This usually occurs around fuel points as controlling more fuel will allow for the building of more vehicles, such as tanks and more often than not, these tanks will be the main driving force behind your army. It also means you can flank enemy sectors and cut off their resource routes. If a sector is not directly connected to your HQ via other friendly sectors you will no longer gain the resources from that area, it also prevents the building of defences such as bunkers in that area, meaning you can cut off territory to starve the enemy while not actually taking every sector on the map. Doing this in the late game can seriously hurt the enemy’s production of much needed tanks and armoured cars. Of course, infantry are as equally important in this game, which is where another of this game’s unique features comes in. by adding a retreat function you can quickly force a squad of infantry to drop what they are doing and sprint back to your HQ. This is vital as you are able to reinforce squads for a fraction of the price of creating an entirely new squad. This means you have to really take care of your men and forces you to keep a close eye on any action that is taking place.  Another great feature with this game is that each side has three unique command trees that you can choose from during the game. The Allies have Infantry, Airborne and Tank commanders, these are fairly self explanatory and provide you with support such as anti-tank infantry Rangers, Airborne troops and AT-guns and the heavily armoured Pershing tank. On the German side however there are some really interesting command trees you can take. First off, there is terror, which specialises in propaganda efforts to inspire your men and scare the crap out of everyone else, this choice also provides artillery strikes and the mighty King Tiger. Then there is Blitzkrieg, which provides tank and infantry support such as storm troopers, and also provides numerous abilities to speed up your men and help them to apply the German Blitzkrieg tactics, surprisingly enough. Finally, there is the defensive doctrine, which basically allows you to specialise in strengthening what you already have by created Flak 88 emplacements and also provide artillery support to protect your base. Of course, which ever team you go, you can only choose one command type so you have to be sure as you can’t change your mind later on in the same game. Having these command options allows for more variety and ultimately, strengthens teamwork, which comes into play a lot in the multiplayer portion of the game. Playing either via a LAN or by using Relic’s online service, you can participate in 8 player skirmishes over quite a large variety of maps, and in two different game modes. Annihilation is the simplest game mode which essentially tasks you with destroying all your enemy’s buildings, the second is called victory points. In this mode there are a number of victory point nodes around the map, each player has a ticket count and if you hold the majority of the nodes your opponent’s ticket count will decrease. The first player to run out of tickets loses. While both game modes are quite similar they do usually provide two very different challenges. In annihilation there is no choice but to keep pushing forward to eventually destroy the enemy base whereas in VP mode you can simply capture the nodes and hunker down in wait of an attack. A few more game types probably would have been more welcome although the simple annihilation mode is usually just enough; however this isn’t really helped by the fact that there are only two teams to play as in the game. While both teams provide a different challenge when playing as them the whole experience can get quite repetitive after a reasonable amount of games, the only thing to keep things interesting is that there is a large amount of maps ranging from 1v1’s to 4v4’s, the latter of which tend to end prematurely due to lag problems and disconnections.  Relic online has never really been overly stable and lag is still a problem in games consisting of 4 or more players, having players disconnect is also a frequent experience which can really get annoying. Since release however, there have been a number of countermeasures to help out. For a start, they made it so that if any player leaves, they are taken over by AI and are no longer just given to the rest of the team to not be used. They have also added a system which tells everyone who is lagging the game if they have their settings turned up too high. Of course this doesn’t really help; it just diverts abuse from other players to the person in question. One great thing however is that Relic have added a lot of maps since release, both official and community, this helps add variety while also adds to the patching time. Installing this game from version 1.0 is a hassle to say the least; there are at least a dozen patches to download, one of which is just under 2GB. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that Relic seems to dislike joining their patches into one big file, meaning you have to download every single one separately and install them all separately…..this can take hours. These patches not only include new maps, but have vital balancing changes alongside a lot of bug fixes, which brings me to the technical side of this game. I am yet to experience any technical problems, which is great since I have had the game for about a year now. Such a thing cannot be said with most games these days. Added to this is the fact that the game still looks and sounds amazing. The detail on the men and vehicles is incredible while the game sports high-res textures throughout the environment. Explosions also look and sound fantastic and because of the fully dynamic physics engine built in, they aren’t just for show. One of the core game play mechanics of this game is the cover system, while units can be put in heavy, light and no cover; this greatly affects the damage they take. However, while a squad of infantry might be all snug behind a hard cover concrete wall, a grenade throw can destroy it leaving them out in the open and vulnerable. This opens up a whole new level of strategy as you have to constantly manage and adjust your units’ positions. This is also relevant to tanks as structures can get in the way of tank shells so it is often useful to take cover, as well as guard your rear as tanks have their strongest armour at the front. To finish it all off, the game runs extremely well. I used to play this using my old Nvidia 6600, 1 GB of RAM and a 2GHz AMD processor and had few problems with my frame rate, it helps that the game still looks decent at lowest settings, but with the recent addition of weather effects it now looks even better. I’m hard pressed to find any bad points in this game whatsoever and I have tried my hardest to find any for the sake of this review. OK, so lag is a bit of a pain, and maybe the campaign is a little too easy but it doesn’t really change the fact that this game is an excellent example of just what can be achieved in the strategy genre after all these years. If you are a strategy fan, buy this game, it has a great mixture of micro-management while keeping it really simple, and there is also an expansion already out which simply increases the replay-ability of this game even more!',\n",

       "  'description': 'I’m going to start this review, by pointing out a bias; I love Final Fantasy VII. It was the first epic RPG I ever played, and I have played through it at least five times. That said, I have a certain affection for the characters and places in Crisis Core and because of this, I suspect this review will be a little stronger than if I had never played FF:VII, so keep that in mind. Final Fantasy VII: Crisis Core is a prequel to the epic Final Fantasy VII, a game from 1998 that revolutionized the console RPG and established the Final Fantasy series as a headline mainstay of the Playstation console. Unlike FF:VII, Crisis Core is an action RPG that requires some reflexes and quick thinking as well as the classic mix of RPG stats and Materia. Also unlike FF:VII, you only control one character; Zack, a very likable SOLDIER operative that you may remember being mentioned in VII. Unlike most JRPG protagonists, he is a lively, excitable, and seemingly well balanced individual who takes quite an emotional journey over the course of the game and who by the end, you really sympathize with. Other characters include first class SOLDIER operatives Angeal, Genesis and the infamous Sephiroth as well as an extensive cast of new, and old faces. I won’t spoil the story by revealing who you meet along the way, but there is a huge amount of fan service in the game that will please fans of VII, but possibly bemuse gamers who are new to VII’s universe, and there lies the biggest negative with this game, you really have to have played VII first. This seems counter-intuitive, as being a prequel, you would assume that knowledge of the original game would ruin the story of Crisis Core, and this is true to an extent. If you have completed VII in the past, you already know the fate of Zack and many of the other people you meet along the way, but this somehow seems to enhance the excitement that you feel throughout the nicely paced story. The story itself is interesting and is delivered “on rails” without a world map to transverse, this makes it work really well for a portable console but it also makes it very easy to just run straight through the story from start to finish and miss out of a lot of the side quests. On the subject of side quests, these are delivered by way a menu you can access from any save point and are separated into a list of different stories that are related to the main quest, but happen in their own time/space (you can be trapped in a cave running from the Turks in the “real world” and then run a side mission in sunny Costa Del Sol helping them fight off monsters). This can make them feel tacked on, to artificially extend the games lifespan. The missions themselves don’t really help to get rid of this feeling, as most of them are simple kill missions with very little story. However, even with their repetitive nature, they seem quite well suited for a quick play on the bus or coffee break and at the end of them, you can get some nice Materia or equipment. All in all, Crisis Core is a solid action RPG that pays a lot of service to FF:VII’s considerable fan base. So if you are a big fan of FF:VII and have nostalgic memories or fighting the Emerald weapon, you should definitely pick this up, but if not, you could certainly do worse.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Psychonauts comes from Double Fine Productions headed by the great Tim Schafer. It is a funny platformer with a great story that refreshes the genre a bit.Psychonauts is about a boy named Razputin (Raz for short) who is raised in the circus and is an acrobat with his father. Raz is slowly becoming psychic and his father who hates psychics starts to notice and makes him practice even more. Raz eventually gets his hands on a pamphlet about the Whispering Rocks camp to train Psychonauts. After that, he runs away from the circus in hoping that he will be able to become a Psychonaut. That\\'s just the intro. The rest of the story is awesome.The gameplay in Psychonauts is tight and responsive. Every power is needed at some point during the game which is a good thing. Since this is a platformer, you can jump and double jump, but also your powers help you jump and platform very well with the main one being Levitation where you run around on a ball made of psychic energy that jumps much higher than the regular double jump does. Around the camp are Psi Challenge Markers that you collect to rank up in the game. The more you rank up, the more powers you receive. You can also increase your rank while in people\\'s minds by collecting \"figments\". Pretty soon you will need to buy some items from the store. Your currency in this game are arrowheads that you find around the camp and by breaking objects. Overall, I do not think the gameplay could have been much better.The graphics are cartoony and look pretty good. I know they went for the fantasy graphics but some items have some jagged edges on them and some characters have some fuzzy outlines around them. It doesn\\'t take anything thing away from being fun, but it is kind of annoying.The sounds in this game are awesome. The voice actors are fantastic. Some of them had to do multiple voices for the game, but they just gave so much personality to every character in the game. The music is great and the sound effects for your powers and when you are hitting stuff just sounds right.The main story in Psychonauts takes anywhere from eleven to thirteen hours depending on if you look around for all of the Scavenger Hunt Items. There is some replay value since a lot of the time, you can walk by two characters that will be talking and their conversation could go for five minutes about friendship bracelets or taking a peek in the girls\\' cabins. Psychonauts overall is a very fun game with a ton of humor, fantastic gameplay, and sound. This game is a must own if you like platformers. If you don\\'t have you should go pick it up.',\n",

       "  'description': \"TimeShift is a perfect example of publishers pushing an unfinished game onto the market in time for the holiday season. While the result is by no means disastrous, there's no doubt the game could have been significantly better.  The story goes that at some point in the future, a secret science facility invents a suit that protects its wearer from the side-effects of time travel, i.e. being squished into a singularity by gravitational forces. Of course, one power-hungry jerk in your team can't resist temptation and steals the suit to travel back in time to achieve world domination but just before your reality collapses, you manage to get into the second suit and follow him into the past in an attempt to stop him. Or at least that's what happened if you want to believe the manual, the actual plot barely figures into the game at all and without that back story, you're basically oblivious as to who you are, where ore more importantly when you are and why you are there. The complete lack of a story figuring into the game is without a doubt its biggest problem as it kills any atmosphere the developers try to create and what good is saving the world when you couldn't care less if it was destroyed after all.  Gameplay-wise TimeShift closely follows the blue print laid out by the Half-Life series, without ever achieving its excellence though. The level design while utterly linear is quite diverse and sends you through a variety of environments from war-torn, urban cities to facility complexes and more open-ended, natural environments. To cover ground faster in some of the wider areas, you'll be given a small buggy as well, however it doesn't control quite as tightly as you'd want to.  What seemingly stands out about the game is that your fancy suit lets you manipulate time at your will as long as its energy level is not depleted and while games like Max Payne and F.E.A.R. certainly have done this to death by now, TimeShift tries to mix it up with the ability to not only slow down time but stop it completely or even reverse it. In reality however, you'll use the latter two mostly for some of the puzzles which mostly fall into the pattern of halting time to press two switches at once or crossing a pathway of otherwise moving platforms. The shooting doesn't feel that much different from other games of this type as you'll quickly revert into a routine of finding cover, slowing down time, popping up to take a few guys out and jumping back into cover. This is especially true after you find the crossbow, which kills every grunt enemy with only one shot and is easy to handle thanks to your time-manipulating abilities.  That said, the actual gameplay is certainly fun, the enemy A.I. is challenging enough (if you didn't have that crossbow that is) or at least knows how to point a gun at you, and the level design, while monotonous at times, is interesting overall. Again, the main problem is the constant irritation the game creates by not giving you any background as to why you're doing what you're doing, but it's possible to look past these problems and treat TimeShift more like an old Quake game.  The story campaign clocks in at a sizeable 9-12 hours to finish and will leave people who managed to care about the underdeveloped and flat characters with a bit of a cliffhanger, opening the possibility for a sequel. Additionally, the game features multiplayer for up to 16 combatants with standard modes like deathmatch and capture the flag as well as the unique meltdown madness in which players have to throw chrono-grenades at the enemy team's machine to slow down its countdown. Upon impact, Chrono-grenades create a small sphere which will trap players in time, making them easy targets. All in all, the multi player is quite fun, but the back-end is lacking severely compared to its competitors like Call of Duty 4, Unreal Tournament 3 and Team Fortress 2.  The presentation is a mixed bag, to say the least. The graphics, while somewhat derivative and a mix of Half-Life 2 and Doom 3, are quite nice actually and there are some neat features the developers manage to get out of the third iteration of Epic's UnrealEngine. Most of the textures are crisp even close up, the draw distance for the more open levels is impressive and the game features some great particle and rain effects and explosions. Some of the environment is even dynamically deformable and will demonstrate the aftermath of a heated gun battle. Character-animation is rather stiff however and the game's cutscenes using the game engine are utterly lifeless and lack a whole lot of polish. You'll also encounter a few instances of texture pop-ins and flickering as well as clipping issues and screen tearing.  The sound design is not up to par with current standards however. Sound effects from weapons, environments as well as the voice acting is underwhelming and boring, which coincides with the lackluster dialogue, and the mixing is inconsistent, making conversations hard to understand in fire fights (which, while somewhat realistic, doesn't help gameplay at all). In the same vein, the musical score is just as unimpressive and forgettable, rarely adding anything to the already hardly present atmosphere.  As it stands, TimeShift is a matter of missed opportunities. The game had potential to become a surprise hit if it was given a few more months or even just weeks to flesh out the story and iron out presentational quirks. Instead we got a competent but derivative shooter with an unmemorable story mode and multiplayer that just isn't up to current standards any more. It's enjoyable while it lasts, but don't expect it to stick with you any longer than that.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Rainbow Six Vegas 2 is the sequel to the award winning Rainbow Six Vegas from Ubisoft, in which you played as Logan Keller, a squad leader in team rainbow who, with the help if his two team mates, managed to destroy a terrorist plot to detonate bombs and whatnot in Nevada. In Vegas 2, you play as a different squad leader who goes by the name of Bishop and the story moves along in the same time frame as the original game; however you are put through a different set of events which ultimately wrap up the story rather nicely. Alongside the campaign there are terrorist hunts which can be played in single player and multiplayer and there is enough variety in the online modes, coupled with a new rank and unlock system, to keep you busy for a good few hours. This game does, however, have a few problems, most of which are in the technical side of things, but overall it’s a fairly decent package for any shooter fan. As mentioned before, you play as Bishop, another typical American badass with a thirst for blood and violence and a real hatred for terrorists, which is just about all you will get to know about him throughout the game. As a squad leader in team Rainbow you will have two other men under your command as you burst through the campaign and even in terrorist hunts. As the game’s story takes place in the same time frame as the first, it is closely linked to the events which happened before, however it’s simple enough to understand if you haven’t experienced the first Vegas game. Overall this campaign feels more fleshed out and generally more interesting than the first, as it includes not only bombs, but more bombs and a little bit of betrayal too, however I will keep the details for myself in case you want to play through it. The reason for this campaign being better is mostly down to the variety of environments, before you were stuck to the stereotypical Vegas with casino’s and restaurants and while they do play a small part in this, you also get a taste of the Pyrenees at the beginning, not to mention a gaming convention and huge hilltop hacienda. This variety keeps the missions from getting too repetitive and it somewhat helps to disguise the fact that this game can get quite monotonous.  While the story may not keep you on the edge of your seat for too long, the action certainly will, and there is plenty to go around. The game has preserved that tried and tested cover mechanic from the first game to keep the action fast paced and intense and to help along the way, they have added a new sprint feature… if you can call it a “feature”. The game play is fun but as mentioned before the usual run and gun techniques where you get thrown into a large area filled with bad guys and ample cover can get a little tiring, if there is one thing I would have liked from this game it would have been more stealth missions since there are very few opportunities to go through an area unseen, and this is partially due to the incredibly awful AI. Whether its enemies running into a fire fight backwards, or blurting their battle plans at the top of their voices or your team mates getting stuck in doorways and running head on into a fire fight only to get ravaged by a hail of bullets, the AI is likely to slightly ruin the experience. At times I felt my team were more of a threat than the terrorists as I was team killed numerous times by poor grenade throws and other general friendly fire incidents. There were also a number of times where they ended up accidentally killing hostages which often lead to me ordering them to stay the hell away from the action and twiddle their thumbs until I got back, at least, that is if it wasn’t already too late. Of course, the terrorists aren’t exactly the smartest bunch either, while they tend to be quite effective at taking cover, some will just do the stupidest things like dropping grenades near their allies or shooting nowhere near you. Overall I think they could have done a much better job with the AI and it really is a shame that it is such a shambles. If it is any consolation, your team mates do provide a pretty effective mobile decoy and are often good at taking enemy fire, allowing you to get the kills unharmed. Aside from the single player campaign, there is also a good range of multiplayer modes to go through, and it’s the multiplayer component where you can see the improvements shine through, as well as quite a few problems. There are a range of game modes including the usual team death match types etc, however the main improvement is in the co-op. you can now jump in and out of a co-op game at any time as you replace one of the AI squad mates, this makes the experience more streamlined as you don’t have to sit in a lobby waiting for people to join. There are also a lot of co-op friendly instances such as rooms with multiple entrances and the like and it is this which brings the most out of the campaign, and I have to admit, it was a real blast while it lasted. Of course the standard terrorist hunts are still available, but one thing which confused me is this, there are actually fewer multiplayer maps in this game than in the first, when some of them are ones from the first. They could have easily put all the maps from the first into this game and then added some, but instead they have limited it to a frustratingly low number of maps which can get quite boring fairly quickly. It’s not all bad though, as I said there have been improvements, most noticeably the new A.C.E.S combat system. Basically, this has introduced a new rank and unlocks system to the game and whenever you play on your own or online, you collect experience points in three areas, close quarter combat, assault and marksmanship. These areas correspond to different playing styles, for example, getting short range kills will help your close quarter combat, grenade kills will help assault, and long range kills and headshots will help your marksmanship. These are just a few examples; since they added bullet penetration you can also get extra points for killing people through cover. The reason for all this of course, is so that the experience is added up and you rank up, unlocking new weapons, clothing and equipment, you also unlock special types of weapons from each speciality, for example you will get snipers from the marksmanship ranks etc. This system simply provides an incentive to keep playing as even if you are doing the campaign it will still add all the points you get. I admit, it may not be as good as the one from Call of Duty 4 but it still helps and provides extra goals for you to achieve whilst playing the game. By far the most lacking area in the game is its graphics and sound. Both Vegas 2 and its predecessor use the same engine, the Unreal 3 engine, and while this is a truly amazing piece of technology, it feels like they have just cut as many corners as possible in this area. The textures are bland, the levels aren’t incredibly detailed, and the only noticeable improvement is the addition of some more dynamic lighting. However this would be a good thing if the game actually ran at a steady frame rate, and considering the game doesn’t look as good as many shooters out today, having frequent drops in frame rate really collides with the experience. I really don’t see where all the time between the release of this and the first has gone, because the sound is even worse. While the guns all have pretty authentic sound effects, dialogue is terrible, much of it has been recycled from the previous game and I keep hearing terrorists blurting out the same old crap they did the year before, it just seems like such a half-assed attempt which is a shame because it really is noticeable if you have played the previous title, of course, if you haven’t then it wont seem too bad, but even if it was all new dialogue, its nothing too impressive, the lip-sync is terrible and all the terrorists sound exactly the same and say exactly the same things…it just gets too repetitive. To make things worse, the game is still buggy even after a patch. I get frequent crashes in both single and multiplayer which tend to lead to restarting my machine, which I don’t like doing without a proper shutdown. I’ll warn you now not to press SHIFT(sprint) and ALT(fall in/hold position) at the same time as every time I do it I end up restarting my machine. Not only this but online there is a lot of trouble with lag and gun sounds often get stuck and loop until you leave the server or a new round starts, this all just gets annoying when you are trying to play the game. I really have mixed feelings with this game, while the addition of the sprint button, the A.C.E.S combat system and bullet penetration have brought some new excitement to the game, too much has simply been recycled. This would fit more appropriately as an expansion rather than a sequel, as in some places it actually drops in quality since the release of the first Vegas game. On the other hand it is still, undeniably, a lot of fun. The game play and cover mechanic keeps the action rolling in and it is genuinely enjoyable, therefore I would recommend this, it is a fun game, just don’t expect too much from this title as it is essentially the same game we saw the year before, but with a few bells and whistles strapped on.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Final Fantasy X came out back on December 20, 2001. It was the first Final Fantasy to come out on the PS2 and caught the video game world by storm. With advanced 3D character models and voice acting, it was one of the most amazing role-playing games of its time and still is.The combat in FFX takes a step away from the traditional Active Time Battle system that the series is known for in favor of the Conditional Time Battle system. In my opinion, I think it is better. Instead of a meter filling up over time in order to attack an enemy, you see portraits of the combatants in the upper right hand corner in a certain order depending on their speed attribute. Also, Final Fantasy X gives you the option to switch characters in your party during battle. So for an example, say you want all seven party members to gain experience in a battle. You can sub each one in, do one one attack then sub them out as much as you want. It is a good addition to the standard formula.The leveling in FFX can be intimidating at first but you get used to it. Leveling up is taken care of by the Sphere Grid. The Sphere Grid is one giant grid that your characters level up from by using certain spheres that you naturally get through battle and sometimes find. Each character starts at a different point on the grid but can go all of the way around, learning abilities that only certain characters could achieve from the beginning. It sounds confusing, but once you start using it, it's really easy.Ah, the sound in Final Fantasy X. It's very good most of the time. The music is amazing and the sound effects are great. Sometimes the voice acting can be a bit spotty. Characters like Auron, Lulu, and Seymour are great. The worst example of the voice acting would be the conversation between Yuna and Tidus about lightening up and relaxing and they laugh. That almost physically hurt me to listen to.Long games and Final Fantasy are synonymous with each other. If you go through the story without doing many of the sidequests, depending on how much you want to train, it could take about 60 hours to beat. If you do most of the sidequests and mini games and other things, it could last you a good 100 hours and beyond.Final Fantasy X is an amazing role-playing game with an amazing plot (I liked it so much that I didn't even talk about it here in case of spoilers), awesome characters, and addictive gameplay. If you haven't played this game and you are a role-playing game fan, get it, play it, and experience the awesomeness that is Final Fantasy X.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Gothic 1 was among my favorite rpg\\'s when it cam out. I thought it was really good, with full voice acting, a big world and multiple paths through the game. It was like Daggerfall, unfortunately, too much like Daggerfall. It was drenched with bugs that made it almost unplayable at times. Gothic 2 did improve on the bugs, but that’s about it.  So let’s start with what people moan about the most, combat. It is extremely complicated, and if you don\\'t read the manual, you are heading into deep water. So how dose it work. Well you lock on to you\\'re target, and then you strafe around it using the movement key\\'s, right that doesn’t sound so bad. Well, then we come to the actual attack. How you attack is pretty special, you hold down the attack key. Then you press the direction key that correspond to witch swing you want to do. Yeah I know sound weird. And at first it is, it’s cumbersome, as you have to stop moving to attack someone/thing. You do how ever learn the tactics after a while. But it causes a very steep learning curve; witch is not helped much with the fact that the game is damn hard!  Witch brings us to the next problem, this game is friggin hard! Just a couple of swings can kill you. And if you pick a fight with the wrong dude, he can one hit you\\'re scrawny ass straight to Beliar! Wandering of in the wrong direction will also most likely get you killed as well, as the creatures get tougher the longer away you get from the beaten track. This might sound unappealing, but as long as you remember to save frequently its pretty ok. It gives you that sense of accomplishment when you can get to a place where you never had a chance before... and the first time you kill an Orc you will feel like a god! None of that \"hold-you\\'re-hand\" stuff like Oblivion, mess up and you\\'re dead.  Now to the good part, the world, graphics and sounds of Gothic 2. This is what Gothic is all about! So the world, talk about living breathing world. It’s amazing, it’s lush and green, with a full day and night cycle. With people doing there daily duties, working at the day, eating and going to the Inn at evenings then going to bed at night. But not only that, but the world is sprawling with landmarks. Tower\\'s on high cliff sides, lighthouse guarding the shore, the docks with the paladin’s ship and rural ruins. The full voice acting is back from Gothic 1, same is the nameless hero\\'s voice actor. Its solid voice acting that helps convey the story in that epic kind of feel that you would want. The music is also amazing; it’s an orchestral theme that really sounds good. It\\'s an important part of the atmosphere.  All in all I would say that every one that enjoys a good RPG should definitely try the game. How ever if you have little patients for gameplay issues, then you should probably stay away. If it wasn\\'t for the cumbersome control\\'s this would be a 5 star, how ever, Gothic 2 is yours truly favorite game of all time. It\\'s just not for everybody.',\n",

       "  'description': 'For many years “Tycho” and “Gabe” over at Penny Arcade have been commentators on all aspects of video games, including game design, marketing styles and the review process and this puts them in a tricky position now they themselves have entered the industry with their debut game, the gloriously titled; Penny Arcade Adventures Episode One: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness. In the past they have been merciless in their attacks on other games, so it was a brave move to make a game. That’s all I’m going to say about Penny Arcade outside the game for the rest of this review, as a lot of reviewers have been preoccupied with “The Penny Arcade Empire” and have not been able to review the game in a fair manner. Episode One (as I will call it for the sake of volume) feels very much like a classic turn based RPG where you are in control of three characters; Tycho, Gabe and you. Now when I say you I don’t mean it in a Time magazine “You are the Person of the Year!” kind of way, I mean that you actually make an avatar of yourself that interacts with Gabe and Tycho in the game world. One of the brilliant features of the character creation system on Episode One is that whatever character you make gets shown in 3D in the game world, but also in 2D in all the comic book style cut scenes that have been made by Gabe himself. This not only looks great, but it also makes your character fit into the world really nicely in a way that games in the past have failed to do. The turn based battle system is pretty solid, with “limit break” style attacks triggering a quick mini-game which you need to do well at to deal the most damage. This works quite nicely, and gives the battles a sense of urgency. There are a load of items in the game and your weapons can be upgraded, which coupled with the leveling system gives you a nice feeling of progression. The writing in the game is great, with the classic crude Penny Arcade humor throughout and a selection of new and old characters to meet up with (and possibly kill). However the game really loses points when you are not in a battle or a conversation. There is a huge amount of running around the two moderately sized (and one small) areas randomly pressing A and looking for battles or the next story piece and this can get frustrating, giving the impression that the game is longer than it actually is. It took me about 7 hours to complete it with all the enemies killed which is okay for an episodic game, but about 2 hours of that must have been wasted being frustrated running around. The difficulty feels a little odd, with one battle with normal enemies being hard, and then the next battle with a boss just being long. Overall the game is pretty fun, and you can certainly find worse on the Live Arcade. However to get the most out of the game, you need to be an existing Penny Arcade fan. I am not sure if I would recommend it to people who had not heard of PA before though, as a lot of this games charm is in its fan service.',\n",

       " {'deck': 'The GTAIV Sausage Review',\n",
       "  'description': 'Grand Theft Auto IV is no question the biggest game of 2008(even though it\\'s only April) and there have been epic amounts of hype behind it. I have been a fan of the series since it\\'s birth on the PC and all those people who argue that the series is a Sony series can go and F*** their PS3 in a closet because they are what I like to call \"retards\". This is no question the best game in the series, but it is far from perfect. Some problems from past games are still present, but major issues(like shooting) have been fixed overall.The story is of a high production value just like the previous games, but now with a bit more importance placed upon it. Everything is extremely well done as a whole, but as you progress through the game you\\'ll notice that the character of Niko isn\\'t as human as you might expect. Niko soon becomes someone who will do anything for money and barely ever questions what is asked of him. He bases most these actions on \"loyalty\", but he comes across as someone without empathy. This may be a good thing for most because it makes dicking around in the game easier to swallow because you will no longer doubt Niko is capable of doing those actions. Besides that the story is really well done and the voice acting is excellent. I found the writing to be great and especially enjoyed the dialogue between characters after a night of drinking. The drunken chats are funny and believable, but most importantly feel like the kind of conversations one would have while being intoxicated. So you heard it here first, I fully promote drinking and chatting. It\\'s a win/win situation!I found the controls for the game to be great, especially the shooting. The game does have a lock-on system that does \"work\", but you can turn off lock-on feature so that you always use free-aim and that is where it works best. I found the shooting system similar to that of Resident Evil 4 and it worked great for me. I never enjoyed the shooting in previous GTA games that much, but now I absolutely love the system and even the cover system works well. Pretty much any piece of architecture can be used as cover and though the action of getting into cover isn\\'t super smooth, it does work surprisingly well. The hand-to-hand combat has been improved from \"shitty\" to \"decent\" though you never have much reason to fight with your hands. I will say that after you get used to the fighting system the small amount of depth does become fun and it is more challenging than the retarded counter system in Assassin\\'s Creed. The driving has gone down a more realistic tone(just like the game as a whole) and it may take a little getting used to, but after some time you\\'ll be driving like you always do; which means you\\'ll be knocking over a lot of light poles.The mission structure follows a very similar path as the previous games, but there are a few epic missions that will not soon be forgotten. The bank job has been the most talked about mission and all I\\'ll say is that if Kane and Lynch was like that mission then I would have bought that game. Some missions have major flaws though, mainly most of the chase missions. When you are chasing someone in a car/bike most of the time it is impossible to kill them until they have reached a designated point, such as crashing their car or getting some backup etc. I can understand the reason behind this decision because the chases do have many scripted events that are cool, but knowing that I can\\'t do anything until I hit a specific point really takes you out of the experience. I was chasing a guy on a bike and shot the hell out of him but he never died. I was chasing a dude in a car and shot at his tires, but apparently he found the only bullet-proof tires in game. These issues tend to take away from the open mission structure and pull you out of the experience. That is just a small gripe and for the most part the missions are fun to play.Graphically the game is gorgeous and is truly one of the best looking games out there. Old series plagues like pop-in still happen, but they are nowhere near as bad as in previous games. The real star of the game is the Euphoria engine which allows for greatest physics I\\'ve ever seen in a game. Not only does the engine bring this game to life, but it will also leave every person with tons of great memorable moments. Though some times the physics are a bit over-the-top with crazy crashes happening when you\\'re going around 15mph. Another big change for the game(on consoles) is the inclusion of a multiplayer component and it works rather well(with friends). I find the MP to be overall pretty good, but there isn\\'t much depth to keep me coming back months down the road. GTAIV online is fun, but most of the fun comes from playing with people you know. I will say that I would love to see a co-op mission similar to the previously mentioned bank mission; they could even call it something like, \"Cane and Linch\".GTAIV is a great achievement in the industry and is one of the best games I\\'ve ever played, but I feel so many people are quick to call it \"The Greatest Game You\\'ll Ever Play\". A lot of people making that claim haven\\'t finished the story, or are just plain consumed by the hype. The best way I can describe how I feel about GTAIV is with this statement. If I were on a deserted island and I could only take one game that I would ever be able to play, it would be GTAIV...but if I could only play one game that I would ever remember it would be Bioshock. Both games are great, but they deliver very different experiences. I would say that overall GTAIV is more fun to play, but a game like Bioshock is more memorable to me. I\\'m not \"dissing\" the game and I can pretty much guarantee that I am a bigger GTA fan than you, but people claiming that GTAIV is the greatest game you\\'ll ever play is just a ridiculous statement. With that, I give you the first 5 Sausage game and it is some nice, tasty sausage!Pixelated Sausage Kush',\n",

       "  'description': 'Alone in the Dark is a new survival horror game from Eden Games that puts you in the middle of Central Park during a huge catastrophe in which, as usual, you have to save the world from impending doom using nothing but a roll of sticky tape and a used condom. OK, slight exaggeration there but you get the drift. As with most, if not all survival horror games you tend to always be on the edge of running out of supplies, which brings a need for clever thinking and improvisation. What differentiates Alone in the Dark (AITD henceforth) from any other game in this genre is its setting. While the game starts indoors and you are faced with the usual dark corridors with flickering lights, you eventually enter , a huge park created for the stressed out public who reside in …. Or was it? You play as Edward Carnby, a “paranormal investigator” as you wake up on a bed not knowing who or where you are. Great start, unfortunately for Carnby, his life gets a whole lot worse in a very short space of time and it seems the only way to survive is to use your instincts and by doing what others tell you. Of course, there are few other characters in the game that don’t get killed in some gruesome way, so it’s mostly instinct.  I wont go into too much detail about the story, firstly, I don’t want to spoil it for you, and secondly, its nothing special, something to do with a stone, Satan and well, it carries itself from there. Basically though, you end up entering Central Park as it turns out it wasn’t built for the busy city goers of New York, it was built to hold something much more sinister and you go through the game finding out what exactly this is, so you can open a can of whoop ass on it when you do figure it out. Along the way you will take part in crazy car chases, intense battles and many more cinematic events. If there is one thing this game does brilliantly, it is epic cinematic moments; it almost feels as though you are watching a film. Right from the beginning you are being thrown onto the side of buildings, clinging for your life as rubble tumbles past you, crawling through rooms which collapse around you and of course, meeting characters who quickly get dispatched by some horrific monster that crawls through the ground like something from the film Tremors. The most impressive moment for me was probably a car chase around the outside of  as you desperately try to find a way in to what you hope would be a safe haven. The road is crumpled up behind you as you fly through the streets of  at high speeds in a taxi, trying to avoid exploding cars and falling buildings, along with the monster, whose only aim is to rip your car in to tiny chunks. The whole experience is truly thrilling, at least, it is the first time you try it, and this is where the game falls short.  For a start, the driving is too touchy and unpredictable, which is surprising as this is the developer that brought us Test Drive Unlimited, and this makes the sequence oh so harder since it is just too long and it is practically impossible to get it right the first time. Sequences like this should be shorter so that you get through the first, or maybe the second time, this makes it more memorable as being fun instead of that dam section you got stuck on for eleven tries as it requires that you memorise the entire sequence. The real action begins once you have entered the park though. Once you have made your way in you are presented with a fog covered, dark and eerie wasteland where cars have been abandoned and dark creatures stalk through the night. It’s not until here that you really tune in to the more survival side of the game, as you can go around picking supplies from bins such as bottles which can be filled with car fuel, and packs of batteries to keep that ever important flash light from going out, amongst many other things. The most important thing in this game when it comes to combat though is fire. Fire can be both friend and foe, depending on how you treat it, but in most cases using fire is the only way to take down the enemies that come your way. This means that gun you start with suddenly becomes somewhat useless when used alone; however, when paired with items such as explosive bottles, you have a pretty hefty combination going. It is also in the combat where many of this games more interesting features seep through. Having incorporated fire into the game as a natural, free flowing element, it will spread naturally on to anything flammable; this allows you to burn down wooden doors, or light chairs on fire to use as a deadly weapon. Another great thing is how you can puncture bottles of gasoline and create trails of it which can later be set alight and used as effective traps, luring enemies into a ring of fire is one of my favourites, although it’s easier said than done. Along with the creative use of fire, you are also given quite an innovative inventory, which consists of you simply looking down and opening your jacket to see what you have in your pockets. It’s the little things like this, instead of using a dull inventory screen, that help immerse you in the experience as you can combine objects to make them more effective.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  Other great little features include the ability to blink. “So what, I can blink, who cares?” you might say, however when playing the game in first person view it can be used to get poison out your eyes, or to clear your vision. Blinking, or rather just closing your eyes also comes in to the story as a more important feature later in the game. Another note-worthy moment which impressed me was one of the puzzles in the game. Being presented with a keypad on a locked door is nothing new; however I’m pretty sure that having to guess the code by using the bloody fingerprints on the keys is. Also memorable, was a set piece that leaves you being dropped into a bus leaning over the edge of a giant canyon. Having to pile up corpses down one end in order to keep my end up was something that (quite frighteningly) came very natural to me. The games visuals were also up to scratch. I rarely had frame rate drops and it does really look spectacular in places, although I found that some of the ground textures around the park were a bit dull, but the fog and effective use of shadows made up for it. I am currently running the game at maximum settings on my 8800GTS 320MB and it held up really well, much to my surprise. The graphics are also backed up by a brilliant and fitting musical score, which fires out the epic orchestral parts during cinematic moments, and leaves you with a more ambient track while sneaking through the darker places of the game. All these factors come together to create quite a scary atmosphere in places, and I am pleased to say that I am yet to come across any technical bugs or glitches, again, much to my surprise. You can really tell that  tried hard on the production value and stability of this game. AITD sports many interesting features which aren’t found in a lot of new games these days. The use of fire allows for more creative and unpredictable gameplay, and the atmosphere fits the bill perfectly. However, I was not impressed with the control scheme and the camera, which occasionally switches between views in the most annoying moments and often had me clambering over my keyboard trying to keep on top of the right keys to press. Not only this but it often tells you the controls using the Xbox 360 symbols, which is a bit of a kick to the balls considering it was a simultaneous release on all platforms. Add the sickening driving and you have a game which holds many great ideas, presented in the most insane and awesome ways, but is often held back by annoying little things like its controls which is a crying shame because this game was so close to reaching greatness in my opinion, of course, it is still worth a try if you are a fan of the genre. Just be prepared to curse and shout as you fumble through your pockets for something that resembles a weapon as you get hounded by creatures that would just love to rip your face off there and then.',\n",

       "  'description': \"I have to admit, I wasn't that excited for this game. I thought it would be good, but not great. After playing this though, I knew I was wrong. This is one f the greatest games that I've ever played.In terms of story, there's not much. Princess peach has been captured by Bowser, yet again, and Mario has to go rescue her.There is also an optional side story involving a princess named Rosalina. The gameplay, on the other hand, is where Galaxy really shines.It plays perfectly and doesn't use the Wiimote in any unnecassary ways. The great gameplay is also backed up by amazing level designs. Some of them have you moving around while the force of gravity changes, swimming, floating around in a giant bubble, racing on a manta-ray, or rolling around on a glass ball. And that's barely scratching the surface. There are dozens of galaxies. In some of these levels, Mario can get power-ups. These range from classic power-ups such as the ability to shoot fireballs and invincibility, to new ones like the the ability to change into a bee and the ability to change into a ghost. After you complete each stage, you get a star. You need 60 stars to beat the game, but there are 120 in total. After you get all 120, you can replay all of these with Luigi, and you get a level that only Luigi can get the star from.The game has great graphics. They are the best on the Wii yet. The game also has an amazing soundtrack. easily the best of the year.\\xa0In conclusion, Super Mario Galaxy is an amazing game, it plays great, it sounds great, everything is perfect. Bottom Line is, if you own a Wii, you must play this game.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Franchise based sequels are a difficult thing to produce, since you have to keep fans of previous games happy while trying to add something new and evolve the characters and settings, sometimes this can be done excellently and others dont turn out as well, and its unfortunate that Justice for all falls into this latter section. Phoenix Wright and friends return for another round of courtroom action, introducing several new characters and some returning faces from the first game. Set just a few months after the events of the first game, the first case is a slick tutorial that reintroduces you to the mechanics that have carried over from the first game and how to go about solving the case at hand. While this introduction is nicely done and hooks well into the story, it does prove that playing the two games straight after each other will mean that the only real difference for you is the story and characters that are new to the series. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing, but for people wanting more in terms of gameplay, it really isnt enough. There are four cases in total (including the first) and they play out exactly the same as those in the first game, so a murder is commited, you decide to defend the accused and must therefore explore the crime scene, talk to witnesses and detetives and try to figure out what really happened on those fateful nights. However, that is it, there is nothing new apart from the addition of the psyche-lock, an ability given to you during the second case. Psyche-lock's appear as chains and locks (see what they did there?), and you must uncover what that person is hiding to break the locks and obtain the truth. This is done in exactly the same way as a witness testimony from the trial section of the game, and adds very little to the gameplay. Justice for all will live and die by weather you played the first game or not. If you did that you may find this to be a decent story but not really advancing the series and therefore a disappointment. However if this is your first Phoenix Wright game, then it is a fine starting point and you dont really need to play the first game for the story. Anybody who tried the first game and found it not to thier tastes will not be swayed by the series' second outing.  Justice for all is a great game, and the story provides some memorable twists and turns, but ultimately, this adds very little to the series and even rehashes sounds, animation and characters from the first game, fans of the that game may well be disappointed, especially since the 3D evidence investigation is no where to be found and should have been expanded instead. A great game let down by not having anything new. \",\n",

       "  'description': 'Day of Defeat Source (DoD henceforth) is a WW2 based squad shooter from Valve that uses the much loved source engine, and follows a very similar style to Counter Strike: Source. It’s fast, its action packed, and most importantly of all, it’s a lot of fun. While it isn’t perfect, it provides a lot of enjoyment and satisfaction and with a strong online community, I believe this will be the case for years to come. The idea behind the game is simple. You play a series of rounds on a particular map, and you have to capture all the flags on the map together in order to win, you may also win by holding the majority of flags and gaining points, however “full-caps” are generally the way the game goes. The maps vary a little in size but are usually around the same dimensions and provide perfect killing fields for groups of up to 32 players to shoot, stab and blow each other up. At release there weren’t really a particularly large number of maps, however, since Valve distributes and update their games using the excellent online service, Steam, there has been a whole tonne of updates since then, all of which have made the game even better. These updates include new maps, a new game mode similar to the bomb-planting one from counter strike, and numerous changes to weapon balancing. The most recent update of all has been one that has effectively “TF2’d” it with achievements and better community support, along with a few other minor changes to weapon handling. The changes don’t stop there though, DoD sports a highly active map-making community that seems to belch out new map packs all the time, some of which are of the incredibly high standard that Valve goes for, so much so that Valve have even released some of these maps. This means that the initial limitations of the game have pretty much been solved with the many additions of content and alterations. DoD uses a fairly basic class system online, there are six classes overall, and they are Assault, Rifleman, Support, Sniper, Machine gunner and Rocket man. These classes are fairly self explanatory but are varied enough to provide the player with different approaches to tackling situations. If you are on your heels and need to defend, you can go Machine gunner, and simply mount your MG on a surface and start ripping down crowds of people. Alternatively you could try sniping to give over-head suppressive fire. The classes are backed up by the fact that the maps are generally well designed enough to provide different fighting arenas, such as wide open spaces, claustrophobic corridors and maze like buildings. This often encourages players to stick to a certain spot or area, and this can provide interesting situations when you get people who don’t. One thing that particularly impressed me when first playing this game is how the weapons handle. Assault rifles recoil effectively, Snipers rip through enemies and sub-machine guns provide a fast moving, fast firing solution. While the latter weapon may be somewhat of a “spray and pray” type, most of the guns take a lot of skill to use well, and yet they are all fairly easy to get the hang of to a sufficient level. Different classes are also provided with different side arms, if any, such as hand guns, the Carbine, and a machine pistol, along with smoke and frag grenades. My only beef with this system is that the weapons can get quite repetitive to use as there isn’t a huge amount of variety here. While you can pick up weapons from corpses, you are usually stuck to a specific set and cant really mix and match effectively, nor are there any options to buy new weapons, or gain them as unlocks. Of course, this probably wouldn’t make too much sense in a WW2 setting but it just limits your equipment a little and this can be an annoyance. The game is also limited by the fact that it is multiplayer only, like a lot of Valve’s shooters. This is actually a game where I would quite like to see a single player component, if they added some way to replenish health (since it is a fairly brutal system), I think it could be a lot of fun, that said, this was always intended to be a multiplayer shooter, as its predecessor was… still, a little extra on the side wouldn’t have hurt and could have improved the experience even more. By far one of the best things about this game though is that it uses the Source engine. It’s a good few years old now but still manages to produces great looking games that run exceptionally well. I used to play this game on an old GeForce 6600 with everything set to high and it still ran great. Not only this, but its use of HDR lighting makes some of the maps look even better. The sound isn’t bad either, the guns all provide satisfying cracks and blasts when you shoot them and the MG42 in particular blurts out a satisfying roaring sound while it fires. This all comes together to provide a really exhilarating experience and it adds to the enjoyment so much online when there are explosions and gun shots going off\\xa0 everywhere. Having the game run on the source engine also provides us with a good, stable game to work with. Crashes are few and far between, and I don’t remember any real problems with it in terms of glitches and bugs. The game also has a good server browser built in with a lot of filtering functionality, and there are a good number of servers up at any time. The online community has done a lot to help this game progress as there are lots of server admin applications and Valve’s VAC service is generally well implemented when it comes to reporting hackers and cheaters, as these can be a problem sometimes. The online experience is generally lag free, although it largely depends on the servers and the people playing, as a bad combination can provide sickening results, this situation is made worse by the fact that it uses a fairly poor hit-box system for bullet registration. There have been many times when that shot should have killed that guy, but due to slight lag and hit box detection they get away wound free. While it isn’t a major problem, it can become noticeable at times and when it does, it really stands out as a pain in the arse. Overall, I would highly recommend this game to any multiplayer shooter fan. The game has enough variety for you to play for hours on end, and with great community support the possibilities are endless. Match this with the fact that at the time of writing this, you can get it for a measly $5; it appears to be a bargain not to be missed!',\n",

       "  'description': \"When i first came across Boom Blox, my initial thought's were it looked like the usual shovelware that's been dumped upon the Wii non-stop since it launch a year and a half ago. While there are a few alright party style games on Wii, most of them are titles that should never have been given the green light full stop, so i was very surprised when i gave Boom Blox a go, and found it to be one of the most addictive titles on the Wii. Graphically, Boom Blox does it's job, being nothing altogether special, but nothing bad either. It's colourful, and in all honesty, it's a game featuring blocks for the majority of it's graphics, so the only thing that could have changed was a higher resolution, that which the Wii can't do anyway, so i guess it's as good as it gets for this sort of game. Gameplay though, is where this game shines through, with some seemingly basic stuff, that has more depth than most Wii games combined. There are a fair number of different mini-games that Boom Blox includes, such as Varients on Jenga, games involving throwing a ball to knock down blocks or link up combos, all the way to playing like a traditional Puzzle game, wherein you might need to defeat knock down a room full of blocks in one shot. There is a lot to like here, with an adventure mode and plenty of new modes to unlock the further you head into it, but some of the modes aren't up to the level of other's. Overall though, the single player experience has a decent amount of thing's to get through, not forgetting a very decent Create a Level mode, that allows you to toy with precreated levels, make your own from scratch, or share them with your friends via friend code over the Nintendo Wifi Connection. The big reason though, that Boom Blox is better than the usual B grade titles, is it's multiplayer mode. Boom Blox, with 3 others, is quite easily up there with Super Smash Bros Brawl, Mario Kart Wii and Wii Sports as some of the best multiplayer fun you can get on a home video game system. Whether your all taking turns in different varients of Jenga, or taking aim for the biggest blocks available in a throwing game, the multi modes in Boom Blox take the game's basic ideas and turn them into something basic, yet smart, devious and sometimes hilarious when you and your friends strategies, or lack thereof come into play. It's just one of those games that suits sitting around with a few mates, a few drinks and some Pizza, and having a few laughs along the way, good stuff. \",\n",

Hideo Kojima sure kept us waiting, but Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots is out, and it does not disappoint. For me, it\\'s the most fun I\\'ve had on my PlayStation 3 this year.\\xa0\\xa0 Graphically, you\\'ve got to see it to believe it. Kojima went for a truly cinematic approach to telling the story, so most of the drama and action packed cut scenes were done with the in-game engine. The first time I saw the cut-scene seamlessly cut back to game play, I felt truly immersed in the action. It really is a technical marvel. All animations, textures, scenery, characters for both game play and cut scene were really impressive to look at. Everything runs smoothly, at 60FPS. Sometimes, when there is too much action, frames do drop, but nothing too excessive, everything is playable. In this department, I had absolutely no gripes about it. \\xa0\\xa0 About the story, it\\'s still complex as hell. There are still a lot of things on the story that puzzle me. I know the story is complicated and there is too much information, but it all adds to the richness of the overall theme. Fortunately, there is the Metal Gear Database, that will help me remember some stuff. This game marks the end of the \"Solid\" series, good closure. \\xa0\\xa0 OK, how\\'s the game play? Incredibly good! It\\'s a combination of all the good game play mechanics of the previous games, and spicing it up with current popular ways of game play. Players can now shoot with more freedom, now that we have an over the shoulder third person aiming mechanic. Additionally, crawling, forward rolling, hanging off ledges, CQC and the rest of Snake\\'s moves are still here, only everything just works together excellently. I know that for beginners, all the moves will be hard to learn at first, but for Metal Gear veterans, it will be nothing but fun. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Sound is excellent as always for the Metal Gear series. The soundtrack is a mix of Hollywood style orchestra mixed with a lot of techno and rock beats. When the drama kicks in, the appropriate music is played. But the real meat of the music is when the action gets intense, the music for these parts is awesome. Sound effects are as good as always. Voice acting is also high class. The random soldier\\'s \"What was that noise?\"\\xa0 \"Is somebody there?\" are still there, and they are just priceless LOL.Overall, this is a complete package of excellent game play, good (but complex) story, graphics and sound. Yes, most people argue that the cut scenes\\xa0 were too long, and, I agree that they are not short. But this was how Kojima decided the story should be told, with a ton of drama and over the top action. He could have opted for a fast quick way to end it, but remember, this is Snake\\'s last mission, this is how MGS\\'s stories have always been narrated. This is what makes MGS and MGS game. And I can not be happier with how MGS4 turned out. Thank you Kojima san, 10 years and 4 awesome games. English is not my first language, forgive my spelling mistakes and awkward grammar. ',\n",

The visuals are top notch and the level design in the campaign, while short, is very well done. On the down side the story isn't very compelling but serves its purpose none the less. For those reasons I give Gears of War 4.5 stars just incase Gears 2 improves on the first one (which I think it will).\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Uncharted: A Beautiful Disaster; well maybe that\\'s a bit much, but it\\'s far from perfect. The games does some things right: graphics, story, platforming; it also does some things poorly: shooting, lots of shooting...did I say shooting because it\\'s pretty bad. I\\'ll talk about what the game does well first and leave the not-so-happy ending for last.Graphically the game is gorgeous; it\\'s a real looker on the PS3. The animations for Drake are smooth and life-like, but the death animations are extremely over the top (I mean really ridiculous). Also this may just be a personal nit-pick, but the perfect puff of smoke after every explosion drives me crazy. Another thing I would like to know is how all these explosive barrels found their way into this world; it seems quite convenient. The game does look great as a whole and the later environments are really impressive, but as we all know graphics don\\'t make a game; they are just a small part of the whole package. But damn if they don\\'t look good!The story may not be original, but that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not good. This is a fantastic story with great and memorable characters. Nathan Drake is an extremely likable character with an \"every man\" personality. The supporting cast is all great as well. One disappointing thing about the story is that it goes into a very odd direction near the end; it just didn\\'t work for me (no spoilers here). The sound is great and I never got tired of hearing Drake say, \"Oh, Shit\" every time a grenade was thrown at his feet. Honestly if I didn\\'t love the story so much I don\\'t think I\\'d actually want to play through the game. It\\'s not that the game isn\\'t fun, but the game-play doesn\\'t quite match the story and overall presentation.Sadly the bits between platforming and the story development aren\\'t so tasty; like the delicious taste of a nice, toasty sausage. The platforming bits are fun; they are not overly complicated and not overly simple. They seemed to be just right, but the shooting in this game is plagued with problems. The game plays like a crappy version of Gears of War. There is way too much shooting for a game about treasure hunting and it just takes me out of the experience every time (and where do all these guys come from; is there are “generic bad guy” factory out there in the jungle?). The hit detection is slightly off as I find myself missing at times or a shot to the face not registering as a headshot. These issues wouldn\\'t be much of a problem if you weren\\'t thrown into fire-fights all the time.I really wish that this weren\\'t the case because I really want to love this game; I want to be able to call it a great game. These issues turn what could have been a great game into just a good game. Still I have to say I enjoyed myself overall and I would recommend this game to anyone who has a PS3. It\\'s not a must-buy, but I have to say that it is a must-play.Pixelated Sausage Kush',\n",

       " {'deck': 'Welcome to Liberty City ',\n",
       "  'description': '\"With more sights, shows, restaurants, bars, museums, shopping and borderline psychopaths than you can shake a shotgun at, there is no place quite like Liberty City. Where else can you get sworn at by a senior citizen, accosted by a crack head, propositioned by a prostitute, and strip-searched by a police officer, all before breakfast? Discover the history, culture and diversity that make a booming metropolis the capital of the world, at least according to the over-caffeinated locals. We encourage you to explore Liberty City\\'s four boroughs and it\\'s islands, each with it\\'s own distinct atmosphere and personality. There is always something for everyone.\" (Rockstar Games)The storytelling in the GTA franchise hasn\\'t always been the greatest in the industry, although it has improved this time around. In Grand Theft Auto 4 you play the role of Niko Bellic, an immigrant from Eastern Europe and a veteran of the Bosnian wars. He has been lured to Liberty City by his cousin\\'s tales of wealth and prosperity along with the chance of a fresh start. Things once again get off to the usual GTA start as you start working for gangs and criminals to earn a little extra cash. You go through the paces eventually making your way up the ladder as is tradition in the series. The story itself is about thirty hours long, but the bulk of your time will be spent going postal. Along with the main story there are also side missions, and hidden secrets throughout the city. This is a game that you could play for hours and hours once the story is completed. Some plot twists you can see coming, while other you may not. In the end though it\\'s a great story and you can really get involved in the characters and their trials.The gameplay is why many gamers love this series and it hasn\\'t changed much at all. This can also be said for the missions. Taking down rival gangs, performing hits, or taking part in car chases have all stayed the same since GTA 3 and still remain fresh. That said Liberty City is barely recognizable from the GTA 3 rendition. This is also true with some of the gangs you will be working for. Besides a few missions here and there with the mafia many of the families from GTA 3 aren\\'t even mentioned. Sindakos, Columbian Cartel and the Triads don\\'t even play a role in this game. Instead the game centers around the Russian mafia, the Irish and to a smaller extent the Italian mafia. One of the disappointing things is there are no country environments. The playable area itself is actually smaller than that of San Andreas but there is no wasted space. Still the game could have been better off with a healthy balance of rural and urban environments. Niko can do things that some of the previous protagonists could not. He can scale walls and other obstacles, along with a much improved gunplay system. The cover system has greatly improved the combat in the game and it will actually feel like your in a real shootout. Throughout the game you will also be presented with morality decisions. You can either kill or let a criminal go effecting your respect and sometimes the plot itself. There are once again a great variety of vehicles. Driving down Star Junction at break neck speeds or trying to outrun the cops are still very fun. Another new feature added to the game is the internet. Although not that important it play a big role in a lot of the side missions and internet dating. The police system is also slightly changed as they may seem a bit easier to avoid. Your GPS system will show you locations of the LCPD and you can easily avoid them and loose your wanted level. That said loosing them can still be tough, especially when you hit the three star range. The online in the game can host up to sixteen players in a variety of match types. This is a first for the series and its surprising that online can work so well with a series like this. You can chose from death matches, to team battles to even races. Overall the gameplay in GTA 4 is essentially the same as in previous installments. Not to say this is a bad thing because we all know why we play Grand Theft Auto.Liberty City is very recognizable to the modern day New York City. You\\'ll be taken through four main areas. Broker representing Brooklyn, Queens is Dukes, Algonquin representing Manhattan and Alderney representing New Jersey. Many New York landmarks are also present in the game with different names. Central Park, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, and the Brooklyn bridge to name a few. The city itself is more real than ever. This can be attributed to the great graphics and detail that went into the city along with the people themselves. There are many more character models and you won\\'t see two of the same people walking together like in previous installments. The visuals in Grand Theft Auto 4 are not the best to grave the PS3 or the 360 but they are still great. To render such a huge area without any load times between areas is a daunting task and the city looks great. The city has many little details scattered throughout it that make the overall city feel more real. Again the visuals in the GTA series haven\\'t been at the top of the pack but no other game has come so close to rendering a living breathing city like they have.The radio is as good as ever once again produced by Lazlow and Dan Houser. There are a total of 18 radio stations spanning from talk shows, to rock and pop stations and to reggae. The music in this game is not as mainstream as in previous games. Although there are over 200 licensed songs, the most ever in a video game, most of them are obscure. That\\'s not per say a bad thing because they fit well within the game and the culture of New York City. The same can be said with the voice acting. In the past actors such as James Woods and Samuel L. Jackson played roles but in this installment there are no big names. This helps you better understand the characters as you won\\'t be associating them with the voice actor themselves.Grand Theft Auto, in my opinion, has become the most important franchise in the video game industry. Although the series has been mired with controversy the games have always stood out as some of the best of their time. This is no exception with Grand Theft Auto 4 and if you\\'ve ever loved the series before you best return to Liberty City. ',\n",

       " {'deck': 'Haze is as mediocre as they come.',\n",
       "  'description': 'It\\'s sad that, even in 2008, we still have to put up with this amount of sheer mediocrity.  Haze has been looked at as an interesting first person shooter since it was first announced. Coming from the developers of TimeSplitters, expectations were a bit high. It\\'s also garnered plenty of attention from being an exclusive PS3 game. Unfortunately, for every step Haze takes forward, it takes 5 steps back.  The graphics in Haze are nothing special. While it doesn\\'t look bad necessarily, I expect more from games after playing through the powerhouses like GTA IV and MGS4. This game would have looked superb back in 2005, but in 2008 it does not cut it any longer. The \\'Nectar\\' effects look nice, but as with the rest of the game, nothing special.  As you already know, Haze is a first person shooter, and it plays just like any of the rest. Haze plays akin to the original Halo, nothing more, nothing less. The gunplay feels okay, but is stiff at the same time. There were points in the game where I was desperately trying to shoot an enemy, but failed because the cursor on screen decided it wasn\\'t going to do what I say. It makes for several frustrating moments that made me want to turn my Sixaxis into a bullet so I could shoot myself with it.   One of the \\'features\\' of Haze is the Nectar system. Nectar is billed as a \\'performance-enhancing pharmaceutical drug that grants the user enhanced speed, accuracy and strength\\'. It really is nothing more than a mind controlling hallucinogenic. What this means in-game though, is that you will be able to see enemies more clearly, bodies will vanish as to drown out images of death and destruction, reduces recoil, and allows the player to zoom in further while scoped. An overdose of Nectar is dangerous, with loss of mental control and death being possible side-effects. A lot of what Nectar does is nothing really special, and is really nothing more than a gimmick.  The vehicle controls in Haze are primitive, to say the least. It only utilizes one stick to steer, and it just doesn\\'t work. Remember the M35 Mako from Mass Effect? Now try to steer it with enemies all around you shooting you every second that there is. Now watch yourself die a lot, as I did. As much as Haze took notes from other games, they forgot something very important, vehicle control. I find it to be rather embarrassing that vehicles can still be controlled this way these days.  The story in Haze is nothing special either. You and your squad of insecure idiots are sent out to find a rebel group called \"The Promise Hand.\" Only to find out later in the game that everything that has been said about the group is wrong. The game is very gritty in regards to the story, and takes nothing into account when it comes to dialogue. There were plenty of moments during cutscenes where I was wondering why certain things needed to be said. Some of the dialogue felt so out of place that I just shook my head and turned it off, being disgusted by it all. In a day in age where he have great games with great stories like GTA IV and MGS4, we still have hundreds of throw-aways like Haze.  After finishing the single player campaign, there isn\\'t much to come back for. Haze has an online multiplayer mode, but doesn\\'t fix any of the problems as far as controls, so it is not worth your time. Not to mention, every game I was able to get into was extremely laggy, making it unplayable. Haze also has a Four-Player Co-op Mode that went unplayed by myself. I could not torture myself through the same bad campaign again.   Haze had potential. I\\'ll admit, I was curious to see where Free Radical was going with it. Unfortunately, it turned out to be nothing special. Haze may be worth a rent if you can get past the awful control and laughably terrible story, but should be strictly avoided otherwise.',\n",

       "  'description': \"After the mediocre Genji: Days of the Blade, Japanese developer Game Republic tries again with their second PlayStation 3 title, Folklore. And while they still struggle with many issues in gameplay and presentation, the end result remains enjoyable for anyone interested in an engaging action-adventure with a story deep enough to question the very meaning of death.  The game follows the young Ellen and journalist Keats who are both lured into the mysterious village of Doolin, said to be a bridge between the world of the living and the dead. As you explore various fantastically beautiful realms as both Ellen and Keats, the two not only unravel a series of murders lying 17 years in the past but also see themselves in the middle of a war between the beings of the netherworld. While the story is incredibly engaging, the same can not always be said about the game's art of story-telling however. Dialogs are usually presented in a comic-style fashion of still photos of the 3D environments and characters, but often lack convincing expressiveness and are rather sterile and lifeless. On contrast, the rarely occurring cutscenes are a breath of fresh air and the voice acting is mostly solid.  The meat of the game is the combat however. As you walk around in the many different realms of the netherworld, you'll encounter about a dozen different folks per realm, each with specific strengths and weaknesses. Since weapons are of little use in the lands of the dead, the two protagonists soon learn to absorb the souls of their enemies and use their abilities against their former comrades. This allows for a ton of variation on how the game can be played, although you'll probably stick with a few key attacks for the most part. Some folks and particularly each realm's end boss, the so called folklores, will require specific combinations of attacks however and since given hints in form of collectible scratches don't always help to figure out which strategy works, you'll often find yourself shuffling through the list of collected folks. Luckily, the list is well organized and accessible, although brief pauses after each switch can get annoying after a while.  Sucking out a folks ID is done entirely with the Sixaxis's tilty-control and not only works surprisingly well but is also a great deal of fun, especially after a hard battle against an especially tough opponent. A quick yank with the controller is enough for most folks, some however hang onto their life quite a bit and need a little convincing in form of a short minigame before giving up. These range from timing-based thrusts and wild shaking to banging the IDs to the ground repeatedly or balancing them for a period of time. It's not only a nice change of pacing, but also bears a strategic element, as you may opt to wait until you can absorb multiple folks for an experience bonus. Besides gathering experience in order to lengthen your life bar, the RPG elements are on the light side however and in terms of character customization, the game can't be compared to a full-fledged RPG.  Since Keats and Ellen will stride through the same environments for the most part, the game can get a bit repetitive after a while, but Folklore tries to mix it up in many small but noticeable ways. Some of the folks change depending on the character played and while Keats is more of a brawler and can transform himself for a short time for higher damage, Ellen's attacks are often less risky as you don't have to get too close, but require a bit more preparation time. Still, at times the game tends to drag on a bit, but the outcome of your adventure manages to make up for it.  If you stick to the main plot, you can expect the game to take you around 15-20 hours, but of course the game encourages you to collect and level up each and every single one of your pokemans by following a number of side quests for special items and other goodies. There's also an online mode complete with a simple to use but rather restrictive level editor allowing you to create and share your own monster-filled dungeons and play others' creations for leader board points. This component is rather underdeveloped though and lacks a bunch of options one would expect the game to have. As it stands, multiplayer should not be your main incentive to play the game, especially when there is such an engaging singleplayer component to it.  Folklore is, for the most part, a great-looking game thanks to the imaginative and diverse environments and fantastic monster designs, as well as the often impressive texture quality. The enchanting art style is reminicent of what an Alice in Wonderland movie would be like, if Tim Burton was on the helm. Some aspects however, like some of the side-characters and areas don't look quite as good as the rest of the game and drag the overall impression down. Same can be said for the rather confined levels which not only make navigation in narrow spaces in a pack of monsters a challenge but also often forces the camera into confusing positions. Equally inconsistent is the audio, specifically the music. While later levels feature some marvelous pieces of engaging music, the early realms' tunes are so short and loop over and over that you'll find yourself annoyed very quickly. As mentioned, the voice acting is solid for the most part, although some of the characters' voices and lines are rather forgettable.  At the end of the day, Folklore is a game of mixed feelings. You'll find yourself often amazed by the game's beautiful environments and deep storyline, but at the same time, you'll be irritated by minor but noticeable flaws that show in almost every aspect in the game. Luckily, the good parts manage to overshadow most of these issues and you'll most definitely have a good time if you enjoy this type of game.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'I want to hate Rainbow Six Vegas 2, I really do. It isn\\'t a true sequel, but more like an update to the original; taking out certain issues and fixing some problems (though they don\\'t fix everything). With that said I still find the game enjoyable and it is sure to please fans of the original.The single-player campaign has gone through a few changes. Now your created character is used in every single mode including the Story mode, which now has drop-in co-op. The co-op does seem to play better this time around, but you are now limited to 2 players instead of 4 and also I found the AI teammates to be a complete nuisance. Your AI partners will only listen to whoever is hosting the game and they also like to stand in front of you while you\\'re shooting, that is so much fun! I love randomly shooting my mates in the head because they don\\'t seem to understand that the bullets come out of that little barrel attached to the gun. I found myself leaving them in some corner and just calling them back when I needed a bomb defused or something similar. They make good dogs and this may possibly be the early workings of the Fable 2 dog AI! Other than that the game runs smooth online in co-op and it\\'s definitely more fun with a friend. Also if you\\'re curious if the game has a good story, or follows the previous game. I wouldn\\'t know because the story(really?) was crap in the original and I didn\\'t even try to pay attention to what was going on here. I bet I can sum it up pretty easily though; you are some badass special op who\\'s job is killing terrorists and defusing bombs/saving hostages! Did I get it, did I win? Yay for more mindless shooters, I guess we can\\'t seem to get enough.The game looks good, though I can\\'t say whether it looks better or worse than the original, but it\\'s still a solid looking game. It doesn\\'t seem to run as smooth, but it isn\\'t too big an issue for concern; it runs fine for the most part. I did find the architecture and design to be a lot better this time around. It seems that every situation really does have so many different ways of accomplishing a specific task, which can lead to a bit more strategy. The sound is better and the chatter you overhear from enemies is definitely a step up, but I still can\\'t see this game as anything but a rehash of the original. My favorite improvement is how they changed the set-up for Terrorist Hunt. Now you can go through all the levels with your two AI partners, or you can decide to go solo (Lone Wolf). I also like that the menu shows you whether you\\'ve already beaten that map as well as the difficulty level beaten. With all that said I still find TH to be slightly broken. I do enjoy the mode more than the story mode, but it\\'s still heavily reliant on trigger points and once you learn them it becomes way too easy to exploit them. It takes away from the fun and the tactical nature that the game does well in certain areas. When you can play a map and just hide in a room with a shotty and kill 30 idiots one by one; I don\\'t see how anyone could find that as fun. It doesn\\'t stick out on every map, but on a few maps it is just pathetic how stupid the AI plays.The biggest change (and most obvious) is the new experience system. Now XP can be gained in both MP and SP as well as the inclusion of sub-levels. Basically you have your main level which is you rank (ie. SGT) and then you have 3 \"skill\" based levels which are: Assault, CQB, and Marksman. By raising your rank in the sub-levels you can get new weapons of XP-boosts. The system in nice and definitely a huge step above the original, but it\\'s still not quite as good as COD4\\'s system. The online is very similar to the last game and they even rehash some of the old maps as well. There aren\\'t any surprises on the multi-player side which may be a good thing or bad thing based on your preference. R6V2 is basically a game made specifically for the hardcore players of R6V1 and it\\'s a pretty good game.Those who never played the original may love the game and fans of the original will find enough changes to keep them happy as well. I do enjoy the game and it is an above-average shooter, but if the next Rainbow Six ends up anything like this I won\\'t be anything except mad. The series after this needs something new, give me a new setting (I\\'m sick of Vegas) and refine the tactical nature because the game may be more tactical than COD4, but it\\'s not that tactical. The game is good, but it\\'s just another shooter in this constantly growing market of shooters and I have to say I am really starting to get sick of it. I don\\'t want anymore mindless FPS games! I\\'m wearing pretty thin on all these shooters now and soon I\\'ll be finished if they keep coming out at this rate. I hate something to ask of developers everywhere...Give me more Bioshock/Fallout 3 and less Unreal Engine 3 Shooter #16/17/18...I\\'ve had enough already!Pixelated Sausage Kush',\n",

       "  'description': \"From Metal Gear Solid on the Playstation to Sons of Liberty and Snake Eater on the PS2 the MGS franchise has always been one of the most highly regarded in the video game industry. With this franchise came unique gameplay, amazing storytelling and top of the line visuals. But how do you end a series that is beloved by so many? You do it in style and Hideo Kojima with his amazing development team have proved once again how great this series is. You will be absolutely overwhelmed with emotions as you take Solid Snake through his final mission. The storytelling from the Metal Gear Solid franchise is one of the most complicated in the industry and so much emphasis has been placed on it throughout its twenty one year history. The experiences within the games could be compared with some of the best films out there. This may set some people off as minutes of gameplay can be sandwiched into hours of cut scenes, but that's what the franchise is all about. Obviously if you weren't a fan of that in the past than your opinion won't be changed this time around. Not to spoil anything but besides the ending cinematics there were several that advanced the one hour mark one even closing in on eighty minutes. The thing is though if you don't know the storyline of this franchise or if you decide to boycott it in this game than you'll only be having half of the experience. Of course Kojima along with his writers put a lot of effort into closing up the many plot lines in this series all of which should be satisfying to fans. Not to be bias but this is definitely the greatest story in any video game I have played thus far and I couldn't be happier with the final result. Of course to tell this great story the cinematics must be amazing, and they are. To tell the truth the transitions from cinematic to gameplay are unnoticeable and the gameplay and story just compliment each other so well. All of your favourite, or not so favourite, characters return…cough…Mei Ling. Playing the game has a real purpose to it as you dwell deeper into their storylines and you really start to feel for the characters. Thankfully closure is brought to each of them. Overall the plot from the Metal Gear franchise has always been so deep and riveting and enough can't be said about it in Guns of the Patriots. As I mentioned before the gameplay within the Metal Gear franchise is one to its own. The emphasis throughout the series has been placed on stealth action rather than straight combat action. Besides a few occasions here and there you could essentially go the entire game without killing anyone. On the other hand though the game can be played essentially like any other FPS. This time around the latter experience has improved with more weapons and customizability being added to the gameplay. There are a huge variety of weapons that you can gain around the battlefield or from a man called Drebin. You can sell, buy and upgrade your armory straight from the start menu. This takes some difficulty out of the game as you won't be hunting for or conserving your ammo. The storyline will essentially take you through five acts each with their own unique setting. These settings and environments vary greatly as you traverse through the ruins of an Middle Eastern town, to the jungles of South America or even to a nostalgic island covered in snow. The boss battles in this game are also terrific each of them being unique from the other and each of them a load of fun to play. From fighting a mutating creature in a laboratory to a mechanical wolf in a howling blizzard each of them is stunning. The stealth movements in this game also feel as real as ever. The addition of the OctoCamo suit is really great as you can blend into the environments around you. So overall its nice that you can take either route, advancing through the game in a stealth or combat oriented fashion. There are so many new gameplay moments that are added into this game that wouldn't be associated with the franchise. Whether it be the superb car chase through a European town or the fight between Metal Gear Rex and Ray, these moments are abundant and superb. With the success of online in Subsistence it was no question that it would be included in MGS4. A variety of modes with up to 16 players can be utilized. It seems like every game these days has to have online and its good to know that Metal Gear is pretty good and has set itself apart from other online games. When it boils down to it the Metal Gear franchise is the best stealth action series out there and you won't be disappointed this one last time.Guns of the Patriots is probably the greatest technical achievement in video game history. The Playstation 3 is pushed to its limits and every character, scenery, and explosion is perfect. The motion capture and combat is all so realistic and it is an amazing experience. Its hard to explain the graphics in this game but to put it simply Guns of the Patriots sets the bar and will probably go untouched for quite some time. The music in this game is quite good containing pieces from all previous Metal Gears to some new works as well. The music really sets the tone in the game whether it be a high adrenaline situation or some important dialogue. The voice acting is this game as usual is amazing. David Hayter provides some of his best work yet as he is also supported by an array of familiar characters. Metal…Gear!?The fact of the matter is if you've never enjoyed the Metal Gear Solid franchise than your crazy. No just kidding but you won't like this game as if follows the same road. That said though you'll only be having half of the experience if you haven't played any previous titles in the franchise. Questions that have gone on throughout the entire franchise have been answered. Solid Snake is one of the most legendary heroes out there and MGS is one of the most legendary series as well. To bring this series to a close and do it in such an amazing fashions speaks leagues about Hideo Kojima and his development team.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"War has changed. So has the Metal Gear Solid franchise with its fourth installment. Thankfully, it's all for the better, culminating in one of the best games ever.  Metal Gear Solid 4 has been the most highly anticipated game for the Playstation 3 since before the console was even announced. All over the internet and magazines, plenty of gamers and MGS nerds wondering when we will see the next installment in the famed franchise. Luckily, in June 2008, it is finally here. Even better, what is here is perfection.  The graphical presentation of MGS4 is top notch. Never before have I spent nearly the whole game with my jaw gaping, virtually drooling at every cutscene and gameplay sequence. The character models are beautifully detailed. Snake's age is a hot topic in the game, and the graphical poweress shows off every jeriatric detail of him. All cutscenes are done in real time, which makes it all the more amazing. There were moments in the game when I had to do a double take and make sure that I was watching a game, and not a real movie.  Control issues have been a touchy subject when it comes to the MGS series. Luckily, there isn't anything to worry about when it comes to MGS4. The configuration has been streamlined to be more along the lines of a good third person shooter, even taking a few tips from that 'other' stealth game. You're only a button press away from an over-the-shoulder view and just one more for a first person view. Any of these views can be used at any point in time and really gives Snake the edge when it is needed most. There are plenty of moments in MGS4 that need very precise and concise gunplay and this new control scheme delivers on all fronts. Sixaxis motion control is rarely used, but what is there, works well. Also, if you are a lucky owner of the Dualshock 3, it is utilized very well, and is a staple all its own in the immersion factor.  Without spoiling anything, the story is very well done and shows off the masterpiece that Hideo Kojima has created. Snake's brother, Liquid has harnessed the power to ultimately control the world and it's up to Snake to stop him. Several characters from past MGS games are here to help or kill Snake, and it's up to you to help Snake along the way. Snake is showing his age and it is displayed prominently throughout the game. He's also a chain smoker, smoking nearly every couple of minutes in a cutscene. MGS4 is presumably the last game in the series, and it is all handled very well. Every loose end is tied up, nothing left unsaid. During my playthrough, even a few tears were shed, and that is something no one would have expected to hear about a video game, I assure you.  MGS4 will only take about 18-20 hours to complete on the normal difficulty, but can probably be defeated within 5-10 hours when skipping all cutscenes and codec sequences. The question as to why you would do that is beyond me, but for those speed runners, and for those who can't understand the story, the option is there. The cutscenes can be rather lengthy, but they are acted and directed so well that skipping just one would be a crime. This is a game that is just as important to watch as to play.  Metal Gear Online heads MGS4's plethora of extras. A full online mode taking the gameplay from the single player game online pitting you against 16 of your most dear friends is at your disposal. Yep, you can even kill your opponents with a Playboy magazine from across the country. It is slightly unfortunate that there are only a few maps to choose from, but there will be more downloadable later as this is only billed as the 'Starter Pack' for Metal Gear Online. A few of the other extras include downloadable camoflauge and ipod songs. They are all nice touches to an already perfect game.  Metal Gear Solid 4 is easily the greatest entry in the MGS series, sporting a refined control scheme, excellent story and superb extras that will keep you coming back for more. It deserves nothing less then a perfect score. It's okay not to believe the hype, but believe me when I say it is well deserved and worth buying a Playstation 3 over. Buy this game.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Tomba, the First game by whoopee camp, is a very unusual and unique game, which stands out from other games because of its unique way of gameplay, It’s a side scroller, is kinda puzzlish, kinda like a RPG, and also has many adventure and platformer elements.   The story is pretty straight forward, at first, but then the twists and turns in the story will keep you going on till the end. The story begins with your precious bracelet (handed down to u by your grandpa) being stolen by some Pigs, and you then following their path to reach a village. It starts as a journey to recover the bracelet but in course of your journey you find out about the EVIL SWINEs and their evil deeds and finally getting rid of them all and saving the world:D. As you progress from one place to the other, you will find many NPC, most of the story is driven by the NPC who each have a story to tell and help to ask, and helping each character is the key to getting through the various places as they help you to a very great extent, some teach u new moves, and some might give you some items that are required to pass through certain areas. Each place has its story to tell and each place and its surrounding is cursed by one of the evil swines which completely transformed the area into a melancholic place. And sometimes transforming the citizens into different creatures than what they are.  The basic thing is that you will have to go to each of the 100, 1000, 1000000……. Year Old men and get to know of what and who has cursed the place and try to regain peace and harmony in all lands, you will have to find a Pig bag which is hidden in nearby places to the areas which are cursed and only then u will be able to see the layer of the evil pigs , somewhere in that cursed land, you will have to fight them and capture them in the pig bags to lift the curse off the place. Every area transforms into the former form when you capture the evil pig of that area, giving you new places to explore which were not available before.  The whole adventuring is done by the way of Missions that the NPC give you, the mission when given is mentioned on the screen and also when you finish a particular mission the CLEARED word is shown, along with the missions objective. This way of mission oriented but NON-Linear gameplay really makes playing this game a VERY special experience.  Gameplay wise the game does many good things, by giving you different ways to attack and the primary way being, you jumping on Evil pigs, biting them and then tossing them. you will learn to swim, dash like an animal, dive, and many other things, you will also have many items to use, you can use your dog BARON, who has huge ears like DUMBO, to fly from one area to another, removing the burden of traveling all way from one place to the other. Many minigames in the game are also present and they are fun to play. The game also has its platforming moments, with many jumps and tricky moves to get to different places, The RPG elements in the game improve your strength and increase your level via experience points called AP, having a HIGH AP is very imp ;) as It will unlock a secret in the NEXT game (Tomba 2).Every part of the game is a puzzle having u to figure out what to do and HOW to do it. Mostly by collection items and finding possible routes to new areas and machinery which on using might alter the situations in places.  Graphically it is quite simple, it is complete 2D but you can go from the background to foreground in many areas, Backgrounds are nicely done especially the mushroom forest. Every other part of the graphics is as good as it gets on PSone (2D).  The Music in the game is exceptionally well done and it easily gets stuck in your mind:D u will travel through many diverse localities and meet many strange characters, adding great interest into the players mind. The enchanted mushroom forest will excite and also maybe scare as you see all those BIG flower faces laugh haughtily as you walk by and eat mushrooms, which either makes you cry or laugh.   All in all the game is a awesome package which will re-introduce to u the feeling that you got when you played games for the first time. I would recommend it to any gamer who loves playing platformers and also to the ones who are searching for a new and unique experience.',\n",

       "  'description': 'I remember when Frontlines was first announced it was my most anticipated shooter (before COD4 existed in any form) and I have had high hopes for the game ever since. Sadly I can\\'t really say many good things about the game. I can say that it has a lot of potential, but I wouldn\\'t take that as much of a compliment. The single-player campaign is fun, but it does have its issues. There is a \"story\" to the game and it\\'s not horrible like Battlefield, but not great like COD4; it’s good enough to move you along from mission to mission. The story takes place in the near future and is focused around an oil crisis. The story is interesting because it\\'s actually something that could conceivably happen.The single-player experience was actually more enjoyable than I expected, though a few issues really took away from the experience. The thing that bothered me the most was that while attacking a position and having a good shootout; I suddenly die from a huge explosion! How does this happen you ask? Well it seems that the game likes to sneak enemy tanks on your position. Maybe it\\'s just me, but I don\\'t really like having something that big sneak up behind me. I think in some states that\\'s actually called rape, but I can\\'t be sure. The AI isn\\'t always too bright either; on a few occasions I found one of my teammates, as well as an enemy soldier, just standing near each without shooting or doing anything. That didn\\'t happen too much, but the times that it did happen really did take me out of the experience. I also have to say that the controls are pretty bad in my eyes. They just seem “old” to me, but some people may prefer them that way.The game is pretty much average on the graphical side. I wouldn\\'t call it a great looking game in the likes of COD4, but it holds it\\'s own. Actually I would say that it looks extremely similar to the 2007 shooter Blacksite: Area 51. Even though the game looks fine, I really hope that the Unreal engine is capable of more otherwise we may find ourselves in a market of shooters that not only play alike, but look alike as well. That\\'s a whole other discussion on its own and I won\\'t go into it here. The sound is fine, you hear bullets whizzing by and explosions all over the place; it\\'s all well done and keeps you immersed in the game. Even though the single-player experience has it\\'s flaws (and is a bit short), I still enjoyed myself which is something I can\\'t say about the multi-player.The multi-player is a mess, both on a technical level and some of the design choices. The game can supposedly handle up to 50 players on the 360, but I have trouble finding games with just 32 players. This is an issue because some maps are absolutely huge and thus unplayable with a small group of players. The maps are a mixed bag as well; they range in size from small to massive and it gives the game a bit of a schizophrenic feeling. There is also an issue with hit detection (which may be related to lag), but this makes certain things difficult. When I was playing as a sniper I couldn\\'t seem to hit anything, but up close this didn\\'t seem to be as big of a problem. I don’t know if they are going to fix these issues, but I can’t say I’ll care enough in a few months to come back. If they had more time to work out the kinks there could be a really fun game under all of it, but now were just stuck with another generic shooter.I wanted to love this game and after playing the game I can’t even say that I really even like it that much. It ends up just being an “ok” shooter and in a time where we already have plenty of decent shooters; we don’t really need more shooters to add to the already over-populated genre.Pixelated Sausage Kush',\n",

       "  'description': \"Rocketmen: Axis of Evil is basically Smash TV with an attempt to add a story and RPG elements. What Puzzle Quest does for Bejewelled, Rocketmen does for Smash TV. I have to say that every time I play this game I can’t help but think of my friend Rob (aka Elton John), he is quite the rocketman! “I'm not the man they think I am at home; Oh no, no, no I'm a rocket man”, sorry I couldn’t help myself.The game succeeds for the most part, but there are a few things holding it back. The story is garbage (thankfully you can skip every part of it). It’s an extremely generic story where you go out to rescue some people as save some things…blah, blah, blah. Awful attempts at humor and disappointing cut-scenes don’t help it out either. The camera is a nuisance at times as well. You may have a certain side quest that you are unable to fulfill because the camera won’t budge and allow you to get to where you need to be. I personally didn’t find that to be a huge problem, but for some it may very well damper the game.Graphically the game is good and has a nice style to it, but many enemies are recycled during the course of the game. It features a decent create-a-character system where you can even make a female character appear nude (skin colored suits). I have to say that your character has one of the weirdest walking animations I’ve ever seen; it’s really weird that no one noticed this during development. The game runs really smooth and I never experienced slow-down, even during online play. Speaking of online play, my experience was that half the people are serious and the other half doesn’t shoot, grabs all the loot, and are just plain douches (So pretty much like all online games).The game-play is solid and works just like Smash TV or similar games. You move around with the left stick and fire your weapon with the right stick. The difficulty is a problem as I found it to be extremely unbalanced. In the beginning the game may seem hard, but once you get through a few of the levels and raise your stats you will soon find the game to be very easy. You start out each level with just a pistol and you can get weapon upgrades (which last for about 15 seconds) such as shotguns, machine guns and a razor gun. Other power-ups include shields and speed upgrades, nothing out of the ordinary. Also there are “minerals” scattered in objects and all around the world that are used to upgrade your armor, weapons, and give you storable power-ups.The game is fun for a few playthroughs, but after you’ve fully leveled up your character you’ll find the game too easy and just plain boring. As much as I loved the game and had a blast playing through it initially; I can’t recommend it unless you’re really dying for a new Smash TV type of game. It’s a good game, but it’s just not a great game.Pixelated Sausage Kush\",\n",

       "  'description': \"(Just copy-pasting an old review of mine from GS, just to see the reader review system in action ...and probably expect a ton of bias). Morrowind is the much-anticipated third installment of the Elder Scrolls series. Arriving four years after the release of its predecessor, The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall, Morrowind seems more than worthy to carry on the tradition of the immerse and non-linear style of role-playing game. Like Daggerfall, Morrowind is a first-person RPG that lets you basically choose your own adventure--a style of game that admittedly isn’t for everyone. However for those with an independent streak who would rather “go it alone” than be shepherded from scenario to scenario, Morrowind will not disappoint.This game has even less of a premise than Daggerfall, a game which basically dumped you onto a continent with a vague order from the Emperor to investigate the ghost of a king who was haunting the castle of the capital city. Morrowind gives you even less to work with. You are a convict; nameless, faceless, without a history, who has been mysteriously granted freedom by the Emperor, released onto the giant island-continent Vvardenfell and given orders to deliver a package to a certain individual in a nearby town. This is the extent to which your quest is introduced--the rest is up to you.Your first step will be creating a character, and Morrowind has one of the most thorough and detailed character generation systems I have ever seen. Not only can you specify your character’s race and gender, but can then choose from several different physical representations of that race, each with different facial features and hairstyles. Most of the races available in Daggerfall have been carried over and a few new choices have been added: there are the human races of Redguard, Nord, Imperial and Breton; the elven races of High Elf, Dark Elf and Wood Elf, and the bestial Khajit (cat-like creatures) and Argonians (lizard-men). Orcs are also a playable race this time, instead of being the mindless monsters they were in Daggerfall. Once a race has been chosen you can assign a profession for your character, each of which has different major, minor and miscellaneous skills. (These skills fall into three broad categories of Combat, Magic and Stealth and include the various magical disciplines and fighting arts as well as things like lock-picking, sneaking, acrobatics, swimming, armor-repair and mercantile abilities. Major and minor skills will be easier to increase and affect your character’s level advancement.) It is also possible to create a custom class and choose your own skill-sets. You can even choose what “sign” your character was born under. (Each sign gives your character certain special abilities.) The sign feature replaces the assignment of certain specific strengths and weaknesses in Daggerfall. In Morrowind, strengths and handicaps such as night vision, weakness to disease, immunity to poison, magic resistance and such are decided by the race and sign that you selectYou begin your quest in one of the more backwater towns of Vvardenfell, but from there the entire continent becomes open to you. You can elect to begin the main quest straight away by delivering the package as you were told, or ignore orders for the time being and set off exploring on your own. For those with an adventurous spirit, Morrowind is full of dungeons, shipwrecks, ruins and mines full of monsters and treasure. Or, you can become involved in the politics of Vvardenfell by joining guilds or one of the three Imperial Houses. Guilds include the Thieves, Fighters and Mages guilds, and there are several other factions that accept recruits as well. However, you must be careful who you ally yourself with because politics are always in motion and you will almost certainly end up making enemies with another faction. Great Houses are farther reaching, and allying yourself with one is a major decision that cannot be revoked.The thing that becomes apparent almost straight away is that Morrowind is very complex, much more so than the previous games in the series. Racial and social tensions, slavery, factional scheming and conflicting political agendas all simmer together under the shadow of a malevolent being named Dagoth Ur who resides behind the Ghostgate in the center of Vvardenfell and sends ash and blight across the land, encroaching slowly but inexorably into ever wider territory. Combined with this evil is the classic conflict of old verses new. The Dunmer, or Dark Elves, had been the ancestral inhabitants of Vvardenfell but have recently been displaced to an extent by new arrivals, the Imperials. Many resent this new influence from the West, and some fanatics are willing to take their hatred to the extreme. There is also the presence of several older, more ancient technologies on the island--relics of long forgotten civilizations. Huge ruins full of artifacts that have long ago ceased to work, but who beckon to be rediscovered and used. There are even rumors of secret cults of demon worshippers and vampires.Guilds and Great Houses will give quests, as will various NPCs. These are not, as they were in Daggerfall, randomly generated and will be the same every time through the game. Nevertheless, the possibility for replay is endless, especially if you actually role-play your character and take on a persona. Perhaps you are a noble knight who helps people in distress and expects no reward in return, or a thief who never pays for anything if he can help it but prefers to pickpocket and shoplift, or an ambitious mage whose goal is to advance through the ranks of the guild and become Grand Master, or a “Robin Hood” type character who frees slaves and steals from the rich, or an evil outlaw who spurns authority and will kill for the shirt off someone’s back. Add to this the fact that becoming a member of certain factions excludes you from joining others, meaning you will have to play the game multiple times to experience everything.But all this development would be for nothing without good game mechanics, and Morrowind delivers there as well. Morrowind is a skills-based game, which means that your character improves by successfully performing a skill as opposed to gaining experience points. For example, if your character successfully picks a lock or casts a spell enough times, his skill level will improve. For this reason, the character will be weak in the beginning of the game, which makes things quite challenging, but as skills improve and the character becomes more powerful, the game will get easier. You will be able to notice your character’s performance improving over the course of the game is his skills increase. For example, as Athleticism and Acrobatics are increased, there will be a noticeable improvement in the character’s speed and how high she can jump. Not only is this highly realistic, but also allows you to focus on the skills you want to improve rather than getting blanket improvements to each skill every time you level up. Stats, on the other hand, are improved by leveling up, and leveling up happens each time major and minor skills increase by a total of 10. Stats are the usual categories of strength, intelligence, willpower, etc and govern how well skills are performed and certain other things like maximum HP and MP.The world of Morrowind is 3-D at its best, in that you can make your way into every nook and cranny of the game environment. By climbing, swimming or using levitation you can scale mountains, reach underground caverns, cross lakes or ravines, or even climb over the walls and roofs of buildings, often discovering secrets in the process. The game comes with a decent paper map, but at least 80% of the areas in Morrowind are unmarked and waiting to be discovered by the explorer.The fighting in Morrowind is fairly basic, and does not have to be the focus of the game unless your character is a fighter. Basically you don’t “engage” an enemy in a one-on-one turn-based battle, but can take a swipe at anyone who is close enough to you. Once fighting you can attempt to run away (you will be chased, however), or continue until one of you is dead. You attack by clicking the mouse on the monster and dragging it various ways to represent different weapon strokes. Certain strokes such as jabs, thrusts or slashes, work better with different foes. Offensive magic can be used during fights, and weapons can be enchanted to have certain destructive magical properties. Weapons include axes, spears, various types of swords and daggers, hammers and staves, and there are also several powerful “artifact” weapons that have special bonuses. Armor also comes in great variety in light, medium or heavy weights that affect how quickly your character can move verses how well they absorb hits.There are six schools of magic in Morrowind, and every character will have to master at least a few spells if he wishes to go far in the game. Conjuration is the summoning magic that lets you summon monsters or items to aid you in battle. Destruction encompasses attack spells like fireball. Restoration is healing magic. Illusion changes peoples’ perceptions of you, and includes spells like invisibility. Alteration and Mysticism are varied schools that allow everything from water walking and water-breathing to levitation and telekinesis. These spells can be bought at guilds, or learned from NPCs, but by far the coolest feature is the Spellmaker, which lets you create spells of your own choosing where you can specify the velocity, duration and effects.In a genre where producing stunning visuals is not always the top priority, Morrowind is a rare example of and RPG with superb graphics balanced with great depth of gameplay. The game is absolutely stunning, with characters that are very realistic and life-like, and objects and backgrounds with amazing levels of detail. The wilderness areas are particularly breathtaking, and the various weather patterns such as dust storms and rain add a lot to the experience.The audio is very well done with a nice selection of voices to complement text conversations. NPCs utter a variety of phrases as your character approaches them (not just one or two repeated ad nauseam, but a fair sized list of 15 or 20), and their tone changes depending on their disposition towards your character. The voice acting is passable, with a decent variety of actors providing samples; though later on you'll start to feel the repetitive nature and realize that perhaps the game would've benefited with a bit more lines of spoken dialogue. The soundtrack, composed by Jeremy Soule, is in an elegant and suitably epic orchestral style. The music is subtle enough not to become intrusive, yet still contains some beautiful and memorable melodic lines. The only complaint here is that there is not a big enough variety of musical tracks to compliment such a large and complicated game. There are only about 10 tracks in total, which means there is a lot of repetition.In the end though, Morrowind is a hard game to recommend if merely for the fact that it is a daunting game to tackle, and those looking for a viseral gaming experience might want to go elsewhere. The combat is deritivtive and can grate on the user's nerves at the outset, and the lack of any real direction save for a note given to player might be a little too much for many gamers out there to handle or take-in. But those that do decide to give Morrowind a chance will not be disappointed in the least, and at most will be enjoying not only the best RPG of 2002 (Sorry NWN), but one of the more memorable and endlessly replayable games to come out in years. \",\n",

       "  'description': \"Where do I begin? I guess I can start off by firmly saying that Jumper: Griffin's Story is the worst X360 game I have ever played. I’ll get some quick points out of the way first. There’s not much to the audio in this game. There’s simple music, lackluster sound effects and while Jamie Bell does lend his voice for the game, he wasn’t given much to do. What I’m basically saying is that the audio is the best part of the game. Can you see where this review is heading already? The controls are junk and camera is terrible. I will say that the only real decent part of this game is the fighting system. Each face button corresponds to a different direction, but they never really make any use of it besides the basic attacks.Let's have a discussion on the graphics now. This new generation is the HD-era so I'm guessing you think this game will be a real looker. I’m sorry to disappoint, but Jumper looks absolutely pathetic and wouldn’t even be able to cut it on the last-gen systems. Jumper actually look comparable to some Playstation 1 games and I'm not exaggerating. All the enemies are basically the same with either a darker skin tone or a vagina and the world is extremely bland, but that’s not even the worst part. There is draw-in inside rooms and in some cases the floor textures won't even load in the game. There really isn't anything better than beating down on some generic dude while you’re both walking on air. Besides being a graphical piece of fecal matter, there’s still plenty more loving to go around!This game is short, really short. I don’t think I’ve played a single-player game this short since the days of the NES. I’ve heard people say 2-3 hours is what it would take to beat the game, but I was able to go through it in just over an hour. When a game is shorter than the movie it's based upon, you just have to sit back in awe of what you've just experienced. I’ve never seen a game so poorly put together and above all, I can’t believe that they have the balls to charge full price for it. The game isn’t worth the price of a movie ticket, it’s not even worth the $5 it cost to buy the Burger King games. Sneak King looks like Bioshock in comparison and that’s being kind.Honestly, don’t buy this game. Don’t rent it .Don’t play it. Are you an achievement whore looking for your next fix? It’s true that you can get some very easy points and get them quick, but know this: with each achievement you unlock, you lose another piece of your soul. Trust me on that, my soul is crying his eyes out and I don’t know if he will ever be the same again. At least playing this game has helped me understand the movie. I can see why Samuel L. Jackson wants to kill all the jumpers. If there were no jumpers then there would be no game and that’s the kind of world I would want to live in.Pixelated SausageKush\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'Legend of Zelda, DS style!',\n",
       "  'description': 'The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass is Link and Zelda’s first adventure on the DS. Phantom Hourglass is a direct sequel to Wind Waker on the Gamecube. Meaning that it retains the art style of that game, so if you were absolutely repulsed by the cartoonish art style of that game, then this may not be the game for you. However it is still an extremely amazing DS game. The story picks up directly where Wind Waker ended, with Link and Tetra sailing the Great Sea with the pirate crew. When the game starts, they’re on the hunt for a fabled ghost ship rumored to have a great treasure but also the cause of many disappearances. Before long, they run into the ship and Tetra jumps off to board it. The ghost ship almost immediately runs off, and despite Link’s attempt to leap at it, he fails and falls into the sea, washing up on a nearby island. Soon, your off to save Tetra. As with previous LoZ entries on handhelds, Phantom Hourglass is played from a top down view. Of course, with the game being on the DS, its almost bound to have some sort of touch-screen based control scheme, and thats just what it has, and does it excellently. You move Link around by simply dragging the stylus to where you want to go, and attack enemies either by tapping them to jump attack them, or making a quick swipe in front of link to swing your sword. You can execute a spin attack by making a quick circle around Link. The items that you will pick up during the course of the game also make use of the touch screen. For example, when you use the boomerang, all you have to do is draw a path to show where you want the boomerang to go. You will also be using other features of the DS like the microphone. This new control scheme allows for a whole lot of new ways to solve puzzles, which results in some extremely satisfying gameplay, including one extremely fiendish mini-puzzle. Overall the control scheme is extremely tight and intuitive.Another addition is that each dungeon’s map is displayed on the top screen. While this is usual Zelda fare to have a map, you can now bring it down to the touch screen in order to make notes on the map, be it to remind you where a item is or which lever to pull first. While this may seem like a small addition at first, you will soon realise its extremely invaluable. Seeing as it is a sequel to Wind Waker, its only right that it has the sailing around the Great Sea. For those of you who absolutely loved the first game besides that one particalar part, fear not, the sailing in this game feels a lot less tedious. All you need to do is draw a path that you want your ship to take and it will automatically sail. You’re in a steam ship this time by the way, meaning you travel fast and the wind has no effect whatsoever. However, you still need to pay attention in order to dodge the occasional obstacle or kill the occasional sea monster. There is also a multiplayer game that can be played either with local wireless single or multi card, or also over Nintendo Wi-Fi. The game is slightly reminiscent of Pac-Man, and you will probably find hours of enjoyment from it, or find it a little dull. The gameplay over Wi-Fi is fairly lag free for the most part, and allows you to select from playing against friends, people of around your skill level and around your region as well. The graphics, as mentioned before, are abuot the same as Wind Waker, in terms of art style that is. They retain the same cartoonish art style that people either love or hate. The charcater’s faces are pretty expressive with tons of goofy faces. The environments of the game are pretty pleasing to look at too. On the technical side of things, its a slight downgrade from the gamecube but the graphics are still highly pleasing to look at. The sound, as is the case in most LoZ games, is of very high quality. The tunes are very memorable and add quite a bit of effect to the game. There is a lack of voice acting, apart from the yelps of Link, but that isn’t too big a deal for Zelda games. Ultimately, The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass is an extremely satisfying game and a terrific effort at bringing the series to the DS. The control scheme is fantastic and will no doubt become the standard for many action games to come on the DS. Although the difficulty might be a tad on the easy side for seasoned players, it is still a title you definitely do not want to miss.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Lost Odyssey on the surface looks to be a typical JRPG that could be enjoyable for fans of the genre but nothing that memorable or stunning. However, as you delve into the world of Lost Odyssey, it easily tops it\\'s main rival in the genre Final Fantasy in a number of ways - especially when you look at the latest iterations of the FF series.StoryThe story is what makes this game so unique and seperates it from the crowd. While it keeps a pretty standard JRPG format, following a group of people trying to stop someone evil, the story itself is much more mature and interesting than your standard JPRG plot. It follows the story of Kaim, who in the beginning is engaged in a massive battle between two armies - only for a great meteor to drop out of the sky killing everything in sight, but him. For Kaim is immortal, and throughout the story we see and learn of the pain and suffering of 1000 years without dying. There are optional stories to enhance his experiences, which even turned me around into reading them - something I would normally look over in any video game. The stories are fantastically written and make you excited and anxious to read the next in the series of dreams.The characters are fantastic and lovable, bar the two children you pick up in the game and another female character I won\\'t talk about for spoiler reasons, and really add to the story. You start the game with two fellow characters, Jansen and Seth. Jansen is the typical JRPG comedy character but he is the first of his kind to EVER make me laugh. His lines are so witty and well written that your guarenteed to crack a smile at the very least. Seth is also immortal like you, and acts as the character to add some energy to the crowd, since Kaim is a little on the depressive side in the early stages.The thing to focus on in the story however, is the story itself. It\\'s full of political backstabbing (in a good way, not boring politics!), plot twists, relationships and even emotional moments. I found the end of the game pretty upsetting to say the least - but it\\'s also one of the most satisfying endings in a video game. I would love to go indepth on this story, but for fear of spoiling anything, I\\'ll leave it here.GameplayThe gameplay is your bog standard JRPG style - a turn based system using items, spells, attacks to defeat an enemy. However, there have been some twists added to the gameplay to improve an old format for JRPGs.The first is the Ring system. As you do a melee attack, you hold down the right trigger as a circular \"minigame\" appears on screen - the aim to be to try and let go of the right trigger when the outer ring reaches the inner ring of the onscreen diagram. Hit it dead on (which after about a disk in will be almost always) and you\\'ll get a PERFECT, allowing you to hit more and have more chance of a critical strike. Miss it by a little, you\\'ll get a GOOD allowing you to hit a small amount more than usual. Attempt it and absolutely fail, and you\\'ll get a BAD - reducing damage. Or you can ignore it altogether for no penalty or reward. It helps to keep you engaged and spice up the repetitive battles of JRPGs.The second is the skill system. Immortal characters must learn skills from the mortal allies they gain in the game by skill linking. You must choose an ally, choose a skill, then get a certain amount of SP (gained from winning battles) to learn it - but your ally must be in your team of five on the battlefield so you can learn it. It adds a nice reliance on using all characters, and allows those who really train their characters to make the immortal characters a real fighting force to be dealt with.The final addition is Formation, something that has appeared in other JRPGs but I thought was worth mentioning. This feature allows you to move your weaker characters behind your stronger ones - should they be attacked, your front characters HP will make up a defence rating, significantly reducing the damage taken by the back row. However, when the front characters take damage, their defence bar rating goes down (healing does not bring it back up) and allows more damage to be taken by the back row. If all your front row is weak, your back row of characters is very vunerable.Overall ImpressionsThe story, the gameplay, the music and the world itself is something very memorable and has made it a much loved game of mine. The voice acting is fantastic, the music is remarkably good and sticks with you even after you\\'ve finished the game, and the story is a brilliant example of how a more \"grown up\" JRPG style can work wonders. The after content support has already started, with new items such as one to allow you to watch cutscenes without playing the whole game again, and a whole new dungeon with the toughest boss in the game - and when I say tough, I mean tough. Additionally, Mistwalker are promising there is more DLC to come.The more adult nature of the game makes it shine out from the rest, and puts most other JRPGs to shame and enables itself to easily rival some of the biggest games in the genre to date - and puts it firmly in the Must Have list for the Xbox 360. Story: 4.5 / 5.0Gameplay: 4.0 / 5.0Graphics: 4.0 / 5.0Audio: 4.5 / 5.0OVERALL: 4.5 / 5.0Note: Many places reported long loading times - I have had no such issue.

       "  'description': '[title]LEGO INDIANA JONES REVIEW[/title]  Publisher – LucasArts Developer – Traveller’s Tales  Release Date –  Genres – Action, Platformer  Rating – E 10+ Summary  -Queue Indy theme song- LucasArt, and Traveller’s Tales, work hand in hand to once again, bring us a new game full of shiny plastic bricks, but this time the lightsabers have been taken away, and the force is no longer with us, but do not fret, the worlds greatest adventurer is here to save the day, equipped with his infamous whip, Indiana Jones.  This new LEGO game follows the adventures of Indiana Jones, and all of his sidekicks and acquaintances, throughout the first three movies, “Raiders of the lost arc”, “The temple of doom”, and “The Last Crusade”. This LEGO game dose not stray far from the formula that the LEGO Star Wars games have set, you still have to collect studs (used for purchasing characters and unlocking special bonus’s), a central hub is present for choosing the three different movie episodes to play, and also many rooms for you finding, the cut scenes and the overall game are still hilarious, as LEGO’s put a neat humorous twist on the original storyline. The game starts you off adventuring through the prologue of “Raiders of the lost arc” after you have completed, escaping the giant LEGO brick boulder, and running away from the angry tribesmen, you may rest back in Barnett College (used as the main hub), were you can now choose to continue on “Raiders” or you may start any of the other two movies.  Story   LEGO Indiana Jones, stays true to the original movies, and many memorable scenes are recreated through the LEGO universe, such as the giant boulder, the spining swordsman, and the face melting from Raiders, the monkey brains, and the bridge battle from The Temple of Doom, and the natzi motoricle chase, and the choosing of the holy grail form The Last Crusade, but to dissapoint many Indiana Jones fans, there is no hint of the new movie (Kingdom of the Crystal Skull – 2008 Release), but those who have played the LEGO Star Wars series, will find some refferences, to the game and the movies.  The Cutscenes are well portaited through hilarious pantamimes, with a humourous twist on eveything, even the decapitations, and other such brutal bodly injuries, and distubring imagery. Gameplay  Not much new has been added from the original formula, but with the Indiana Jones universe, it mixes things up a bit.  Combat is a bit harder as you are unable to deflect bullets, with a lack of a lightsaber, but a nice variety of weapons have been added to the mix, such as, pistols, rifles, machineguns, scimitars, spears, crossbows, bazookas, swords, spades / shovels, wrenches, and torches, although gunned armed enemies feel a bit over powered, you can always use your trusty whip to perform a comical disarming. Your best armament is your good old fists, they are nice and fast, and occasionally perform some comical wrestling moves such as dropkicks, and a mean noogie   Now the whip is not all what you would expect, its most practical use is for swigging, but all its other uses are not as good as we would hope to be, you can destroy objects, disarm enemies, perform funny takedowns (my favorite is the grab and kick in the groin, then watching them wiggle and explode, its pretty funny), grab objects from a distance, and my personal favorite, grab any of the three women from the movie (Marion, Willie, & Elsa) for an camera worthy kiss.  Since the force is no longer with us, it has been replaced by new game play elements, such as digging, fixing machinery, swigging from the whip or from vines and ropes, lighting fires, decrypting hieroglyphs, and random puzzle solving, the LEGO building is still present, and the small characters still play a small (pun intended) roll, by fitting into trapdoors, high jumpers have been replaced by women (Woman power ftw), and dark force users have been replaced by thugees, and natzi troops used for entering secret areas in freeplay. (With a cast of around 60 unlockable characters)   The Collecting Elements are still there, minikits are now treasures/ artifacts, which pile up in the museum room of the college (once you have gathered them all a secret is unveiled), studs are still studs, and used for purchasing many characters that you have defeated throughout your adventure, and red bricks (used for secrets such as invisibility), have been replaced by mail parcels, but this time with a very neat new twist, once you find the parcel you must also locate the mail box, which then you must carry the parcel to the mailbox, for it to be properly delivered to the college, were you can rightfully purchase that secret. I strongly suggest that if you have someone to play with, invite them! I completed the games story twice, and I found myself enjoying playing the game with a partner rather then the computer controlled one, because let me tell you, the AI partner, is as dumb as a LEGO brick, it feels like it was designed to follow you, and will mindlessly walk into traps, that are easily avoidable, and constantly get stuck, and occasionally glitch into surfaces, forcing you to restart the level, but one thing I enjoy about the AI partner that was not present in the previous LEGO games, is that this time your partner stuns enemies when attacking them, which makes for less frantic fights when faced with multiple enemies (who will gladly blow everyone up including themselves and their peers).  Presentation  In the world of LEGOs everything is shiny and colorful, but Traveller’s Tales did a nice job, in making Indy’s world into LEGOs, the colors fit almost seamlessly with the environment, and the best part, are destructible, the lighting and bloom effects are few, but well integrated to create a nice fun plastic feel, the only drawback is that not the whole world is made out of LEGOs, some backgrounds feel bland and out of places sitting next to LEGO bricks, but is almost forgiving, when playing the game. Pros & Cons   Pros: - Fun, Simple Gameplay - Great to play with someone - Funny & Charming - Short Missions for people who don’t have a whole lot of time to spend playing games -_- - Stays true to the fun simple formula of LEGOs - Easy to pick up and play  Cons: - Bad partner AI - Occasionally bad camera angling Conclusion  LEGO Indiana Jones, is more focused for its fans, and people who have seen the movies, but overall is a nice game, its forgiving and simplistic, which encourages people to play, it has a nice welcoming charm to it, all of these elements make it a semi casual game (I’m saying its not a casual game, but its not a hardcore game either) but it still has a great depth to it, with all the unlockables, and collecting you can do. It is very enjoyable with many movie related puns, that will keep players enticed to see how Traveller’s Tales, and Lucas Arts have transformed a beloved movie series, into the fun loving LEGO universe  I recommend this game to: - Indiana Jones Fans - People who have seen the movies - New comers to videogames - Fans of the LEGO Star Wars franchise Why I do not give rating scores  I don’t like giving a game a scored rating, because everyone has a different opinion on the game, so no game is better then another, I rather recommend the game to people, who I think the game is aimed towards, or people who will enjoy it.',\n",

       "  'description': \"I'm going to just come out and say it, I enjoyed this game. There were certainly some gameplay instances that I found annoying, but overall it was a nice addition to the lore of Lost. Let me give some background on the game. Lost: Via Domus takes place just after the crash of Oceanic flight 815. You play Elliot, a character once unrelated to the Lost lore and you make you way through the first couple of seasons coming across and interacting with main characters and set's from the show.Ubisoft did a good job in making the surroundings and character models look like their real life counterpoarts. Everythingand everyone is recognizable. Are the graphics up to the standards of what an Xbox 360 game can be? No, but this is a story driven game so having nice flashy graphics isn't as crucial as having a strong story to help support and explain the source material.Well, it sorta faulters there as well. Lost the TV show, while is heavy on story, deoesn't really explain much, and the game follows that same formula. Ask a lot of questons, and get a lot of questions in return. Don't expect to walk away from the game, knowing what went on. So when a game is light on story and light on graphics, gameplay is what really makes this game playable.Alright, so the game play in Lost, also doesn't really live up to the standard expected in games for this generation. There are some fun puzzles, but most of the time you're running through a forest running into trees to escape the black smoke or walking through dark caves. That's kind of fun the first time, but having to repeat it over and over again, is exhausting and repetitive.Even when everything that makes a game fun is not good, why did I give it such a high score? I'm a fan of the show. I know what to expect of the story and in that respect it delivered. I liked interacting with the characters and roaming through the sets from the show solving puzzles and discovering all the little nuances. The experience was fun and since the game is short, I didn't feel like I wasted a lot of time playing it.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'A game that thrives to be different, Capcom’s Killer7 is originality where originality seems to be sunk under tons of big-numbered sequels and established franchises. You’ve played your standard action-adventure title, but it’s likely that no one’s played an on-the-rail shooting adventure with RPG elements since Killer7 came around. Risks are seen throughout this game that are taken in order for it to be what it is, but for the most part, Killer7 succeeds, and can even be one of the most memorable games ever played.Firstly, Killer7 is awfully abstract, even for a video game, so following the story can tend to be confusing. That said, however, it’s the most crucial part as it is a story-driven game, so try to follow me here. The idea is that a once peaceful Planet Earth is being disrupted by mutant self-destructing terrorists known as the Heaven Smile. These odd creatures, ruled by an evil blue-grayish man known as Kun Lan, first attacked a United Nations peace treaty meeting in the , thus causing social conflict between the and . The government then hires a famed group of assassins known as the Killer7 to stop the Heaven Smile and its links to prevent the world from utter chaos.The catch is, however, that the Killer7 is not actually a group at all; it’s all led by an old, wheelchair-bound man named Harman Smith that would otherwise get abused by his maid/servant Samantha. All of the members are actually sorts of his personality, that ranges from a cocky and experienced assassin named Dan Smith to a masked wrestler named Mask de Smith. Each of these personalities has some unique trait or style that makes each assassin vastly different and vital to some of the puzzles and Heaven Smile that you’ll see. Female assassin (that’s right I said female) KAEDE Smith can snipe enemies at a far distance and use her own blood to make certain areas visible. The blind teenager Con Smith has the power to go super-fast, go through small openings, and hear sound waves that can only be “visible” to him. Coyote Smith can jump on top of high places and also pick open locks.All of these personalities have their own back-story, however, and the “cleaner” and talker of the group named Garcian Smith is the only one that can talk to Harman. Twists like those can start out as confusing, but as you progress throughout this adventure, it can also make you very interested in what the story offers. However, with that said, the story more revolves around what the killers are doing rather than what they used to do. Still, this game is certainly very bizarre, and speaking of such moments could not only spoil the story, but could even spoil some truly memorable and entertaining moments that could possibly be enough to buy this game. The game can be so bizarre that it can be hard to take the constant social commentary seriously sometimes, which can be a good or bad thing depending on what kind of person you are.This intriguing video game tale may not seem so interesting at first despite its gritty style; some might be complaining about what some of the stuff the game throws out has to even do with the actual plot. And, true, there are parts that are thrown in just to let you know how far the developers will go to make a weird game. But once some of you finish the game, you’ll have most threads tied thanks mainly to one of the most satisfying conclusions to anything, and once you actually look back at what you’ve accomplished, it can end up being some of the most memorable storytelling in a video game yet.It takes more than some thought to think of an action game like Killer7. If you weren’t convinced by the story concept, understanding how the game plays may just convince you. However, like the story, be aware that the controls and concept take time getting used to, so if patience is learned, you just might be able to enjoy the whole game just that much more. The game runs on a strictly linear map; so much so that you must hold a button to run, whereas the analog stick is actually used to choose which occasional branching path you want to take. As you run (or even enter another area), you may hear chuckling sounds. If so, then a Heaven Smile minion is close. Therefore, if you don’t want to get hurt, you’ll have to completely stop, hold the aiming button to wield your gun, look around with the control stick, press the shoulder button opposite of the aiming button to scan in order for it to be visible and shoot-able, lock on using the same button that is used for turning around while running, and fire away with the button that was previously used to run.Of course, there’ll often be times when you’ll face more than one Heaven Smile, and even though it seems simple enough, there are different kinds of these creatures that’ll have to be shot a certain way. Every Heaven Smile monster has some weak-point to instantly kill the thing, whether it is optional or required. For regular Heaven Smiles, for example, you could just shoot away, not requiring for you to shoot at its weak spot. Other Heaven Smiles may have you shooting its wings in order for it to turn around and make its weak spot vulnerable, while others may require a certain character’s special ability or charged shot.Successfully killing a Heaven Smile (and unless you’re supposed to, without Mask’s grenade launcher) will award you with blood that is transported to your thick blood (think experience points) and your thin blood (used for charged shots and healing your character). The thick blood is especially interesting since it provides a sort of RPG element in the mix. You convert the thick blood into serums whenever you go into the Blood Room that is found in checkpoints called “Harman’s Room”. Then, depending on how much blood serum you have, you can level up certain stats that each personality has. You can only transport so much blood in each level, however, as the machine used to transport the blood will eventually go out of order. It makes an interesting way to differentiate the characters more and cause combat to be easier, but it’s something you don’t have to do if you don’t want to.If one of the Killer7 assassins dies, then it’s up to Garcian to find his/her bag of blood and revive him/her (though you could keep going, but if it’s someone important, then you’ll have to anyways). The problem is, however, that Garcian doesn’t level up at all, and because he is taller than the others and has a pretty slow reload time, he’s difficult to use when trying to kill enemies. Simply put, when Garcian dies, it is game over.All the puzzles presented in the game mainly focus around two things: rings and the skills that certain personalities use. The rings are found every time when you find this crazy ghost named Susie. The elemental rings are then used to solve various puzzles. For example, lighting up candles will be used by the fire ring, or getting a balloon will be used by the wind ring. The special skills that are unique to each Killer7 assassin is either used by their special gun or buy pressing the button that uses their exclusive power. You can open walls by either using KAEDE’s raining blood, or you might have to use Mask’s grenade launcher to blow it up. Few puzzles require any other thought process, but the ones that take more reading and remembering are the more satisfying ones. There are hints that found when talking to certain ghosts or looking at your map, but even when the hints appear less and less, the puzzles are mostly way too simple to be very challenging. All in all, even though the result found when solving the puzzles are all pretty interesting, the puzzle structure often feels the same: do this to get that, in order to get that, in order to go there, so you can do this to get that to get that so you can go there so you can reach the end of the level.The boss battles are similar to the puzzles as they both tend to be hit-and-miss. Some bosses are really astounding as they do a great job in testing which personality to use and can even make simple patience tests very cool. Other bosses, however, are actually predestined, so it doesn’t matter what you do because you’ll still move on. I personally have mixed reactions: it may be pretty cool as a concept, and even though they are, I felt that it could have been a more satisfying experience if you could just figure out yourself.On a high note, Killer7’s overall presentation should be the most convincing argument of how this game stands out in other crowds. Everything intertwines with each other in the nearest sense of perfection. The graphics support the cel-shading look, but in a more mature and surreal kind of way. The whole game gives off a late-night anime show, but with influences from movies like Pulp Fiction. The cutscenes are mostly the same as the game, with exceptions with the 2D drawings and computer animations found in a few levels. The voice acting is overall solid: it’ll have characters like Harman and Garcian instantly likable, but some, such as a principal you’ll meet, will tend to ham it up too much that it can be hard to get into the character at first, if at all, but it’s nothing terrible. Maniacal laughs are satisfying to hear, and your cracking guns and exploding explosions sound quite sharp. The music, mixing acoustic guitars and chilling keyboards and rhythms, fit the abstract tone perfectly, and make the game feel all the more cooler. While it slightly chugs when too much stuff is going on, the character animations are decidedly stiff, and there may be other games that can push the hardware to the limit, but Killer7 is what you could truly call a work of art.There isn’t a whole lot of extra content in this single player experience. While the game took me around twenty hours to finish, you may finish this game at a faster time. The unlockables includes a harder difficulty, and an odd spin-off-tribute to the developers. The difficulty you unlock, the brutal Killer8, has an extra character to play as, which can be pretty interesting, but doesn’t have anything special. The story alone made me want to play the game again, and Killer8 mode can be brutally challenging enough (invisible weak points, no map hints, and a small amount of thin blood makes me go “yikes!”) to play the whole game again, but there’s nothing much other than what the game offers.Killer7 is always going to be a love-it-or-hate-it kind of game. For some people, the gameplay will come out too shallow to like, and they just might not stand some of the needlessly bizarre scenes it throws out there. Others will find that while the gameplay can be shallow, the concept works great, and the stunningly abstract story and presentation is just too hard not to love. This game’s different, but how much “different” can some people take? I personally believe if you hate this game, you’re only going by your first impressions. It’s not going to be heavy on the gameplay, and some bosses just might confuse your definition of a “video game”, but once you finish the game, there’s no denying the incredible feel of finishing one of the weirdest games imaginable. No doubt; Killer7 is a work of art, and the fact that the game is cheaper than what it used to be, there’s simply no excuse to get this game. It’s a perfect example of how a game that has far from perfect gameplay can still be enjoyable. Flaws aside, Killer7 is one of the most memorable experiences you can have in a video game. And of course, you’re going to have to play it to believe it.',\n",

       "  'description': \"His life is a wreck. Drunk, angry and dying for another drink, he crushes some pills with his glass, brushes the remains into his drink and downs the lot. An unfortunate guy gets his face pummeled in by him after accidentally brushing past him. He is Ethan Thomas, former Serial Crime Unit investigator. Several months after the events of the first game, the Serial Crime Unit want Ethan back. Another serial killer is on the lose, and Ethan is the only man for the job.Unfortunately for Ethan, the local hobos have been driven insane by some unknown force. And not the good kind of insane either. These hobos will beat the first thing that moves with a toilet seat, a steel pipe or anything else they can get their hands on. Fortunately for Ethan, he also finds these items along his journey, making for one of the most brutal, violent and satisfying combat systems in a long time.Instead of wielding swords or guns, your primary weapon of choice in Condemned 2 could be a steel pipe, a brick or a locker door. These are just some of the many melee weapons you'll find scattered across the environments, and all of them are great fun to use. You use R1 to use whatever is in your right hand, whether it be some type of weapon or a fist, and the same goes for L1, except for your left hand. While this may sound simple, and to be honest, it is, but a scary amount of depth lurks underneath. You'll need to chain combos to survive, and you'll 'unlock' more combos as you progress.Seeing your foe's eyes widen just before you smash that pipe into their skull, followed by a loud *CRACK* is ever so satisfying. The level of detail in Condemned 2 is unprecedented. The murky streets, seemingly devoid of life, present an undeniably creepy atmosphere that sends chills down your spine. And what's more, these streets happen to be the least scariest and unoriginal environments in the game, but they're far from bad. My favourites include the hotel, because of the amount of rooms there is to explore, you never know what's going to creep up on you, and the bowling alley which has large rooms riddled with hobos. A perfect way to test out your new found weapon: a bowling ball. But even the most action packed levels can be extremely scary. This is mainly thanks to the genuinely creepy atmosphere, but there are plenty of 'jump out of your seat' scares as well.But you don't just aimlessly wander around killing hobos for no reason, Ethan is trying to solve some grisly murders, which coincidentally, happened to have taken place where there are plenty of murderous hobos. Once you find a body, you'll then need to investigate it, and the surrounding area, to discover what actually happened. The detective mechanics are greatly improved upon from the original Condemned. One example of this is trying to find out whether a victim crawled, or was dragged to his current position. So, you bring out your UV light and examine the trail of blood. At first you think he was dragged, but look a little closer. There are hand prints in the blood. He crawled. Other times I had to identify whether a bloodstain on a wall was an exit splatter from a gun. It is great fun to investigate these murders, but unfortunately, there is no punishment for being wrong on what happened. You get a rating out of five depending on how accurate you were, but other than that, you don't get punished or rewarded.There is usually a good balance between combat and investigation, but towards the end things get a bit mis-matched in all aspects of the game. The story trails off from interesting to stupid, the great melee system ends up with Ethan shooting down helicopters while the investigations become a lot less frequent.There is also an online multiplayer mode in Condemned, but it does feel a little tacked on. The deathmatches turn into running into the other players and mashing R1 until one of you dies. The only good mode; Crime Scene, involves a team of 'influenced' (This is a fancy name for the hobos) and a team of SCU. The influenced have to carry and hide two individual heads that are stored in crates, while the SCU has to find these crates and scan them. This can lead to plenty of scary moments when you can hear the heavy breathing of the influenced but don't know where they are, or when an influenced with a pig mask sprints out of the darkness towards you. But this mode also feels a bit unbalanced, where the SCU spawn with machine guns and shotguns, the influenced only get pipes and sledgehammers so they get picked off pretty quickly. But I guess it makes the game that much scarier, knowing that you're creeping around enemy territory where you can die in one or two shots.All in all, Condemned 2 is a terrifying, cringe-worthy title that successfully combines a great combat system, creepy environments and genuine scares to make a good game all around. Unfortunately, it trails off towards the end, and the multiplayer is good for a few hours but it isn't going to pull you away from Call of Duty. If you're looking for a violent, frightening and disturbing game, then this will definitely satisfy your needs. \",\n",

May Act Up.Radio Is Not As Inspired As Vice City\\'s Radio. No Checkpoints In Later MissionsNo Mission Replay FeatureSide Quests Don\\'t Last.Realism Can Get In The WayIn the eyes of the gaming public, Grand Theft Auto was revolutionary and something amazing. However, Grand Theft Auto III is not revolutionary. All the way back when the Nintendo 64 came out we had a free roaming title. Super Mario 64 itself let people go where they pleased around Peach\\'s castle and where they pleased in each level. You could even gather some stars while hunting for others. Grand Theft Auto III took the idea of\\xa0 free roaming to the next level. But it was not the first 3D title to be wide open. And Grand Theft Auto III is forgiven far too much because of how it was different.After three tries on the PlayStation 2, Rockstar is at it again with Grand Theft Auto IV. The difference is that they actually took the time to remake the engine and address all the problems that have haunted the series since its very first 3D installment. They refined the gameplay by remaking it from the ground up. They made it shine in ways they would, and could, not in the past. There are several things they could... no... should... have done on the PlayStation 2 installments that they did not but there is no denying that Grand Theft Auto could not have overcome what it did wrong in the past without the might of these two consoles behind IV. To put it bluntly; Grand Theft Auto finally becomes good with Grand Theft Auto IV.Grand Theft Auto IV takes you back to the streets of, the New York City based, Liberty City. You play as Niko Bellic an illegal immigrant who comes to live with his cousin, who supposedly has made it big in America. When he gets off the boat he finds his cousin has been feeding him a bucket of lies and a shot glass of truth. Roman\\xa0 Bellic really runs a cab company and is up to his ears in debt. As Niko struggles to end his cousin\\'s problems he only gets them in deeper and deeper into the criminal world. Niko will do anything for the right price and his talents at staying alive and killing others is something many people in Liberty City can use. But Niko is searching for something on his own and finding it may be the straw that broke the camel\\'s back...The story in Grand Theft Auto IV is probably the best thing about it. It doesn\\'t glorify the criminal lifestyle as much as the past games have. In fact it constantly puts down the idea of being a criminal for fun and shows how these people are in it because it\\'s a lifestyle that is hard to escape. The story hits hard in many areas and you might find yourself sitting there wondering what to do based on your own feelings in the game. There are times when it asks you to make a tough choice and when you get there you might not be ready for it. But luckily this is a videogame and you can set it down for several minutes to get yourself ready if you need to.\\xa0 I know I needed to...The story has it\\'s flaws but it does make you care about Niko. Niko is a likable guy who is a hypocrite and never claims otherwise. It seems mostly that he does what he does because he has no other choice and wouldn\\'t advise anyone to live the life he does. Along the way you\\'ll meet plenty of characters who you\\'ll end up caring about and some you won\\'t. This can be one of the games greatest flaws in giving the player too much freedom but it would be impossible to explain why without spoiling the experience. The game seems built to support the story but also to take the next step. The sheer refinement of everything that they built into this engine is oustanding. Just playing around with the physics can last for hours if you let it. Every little thing has been polished and cleaned up. And it all supports what happens in the story, aside from cheats and the things Rockstar let slide because it is a game. There are times when the realism can get in the way of the fun but these times are few and far between. Further than all the glitches and purely bad gameplay designs in the past entries to the series. Niko can do quite a lot. He can scale walls, he can fire a variety of guns, he\\'s a skilled driver, he\\'s smooth with the ladies, and he\\'s not great at life but he bowls like an angel. The game offers plenty of things to do in the city but most of it doesn\\'t last. In Grand Theft Auto III you could still do most of the side missions when you completed the game, but both share the quality of being pretty empty afterwards. Many reviews seem to exaggerate how many things Niko can do. This is not San Andreas so we\\'re not buying up property all over the city. We\\'re not flying military helicoptors after petty criminals. We\\'re not gambling away our money to a casino. They took out quite a lot when they decided to make a new engine but what they did keep in outdoes every attempt in the past, though there may be some exceptions.The shooting is aided by the ability to lock on or to aim yourself. The auto-target is more of a problem than in other Grand Theft Auto titles because there are times you can see an enemy on the screen but the auto-target will not lock on. When it works it works very well but when it doesn\\'t it can be an annoying thing to wrestle with. Niko can take cover to avoid damage and blind fire over cover and pop out to shoot and look around corners. He can do quite a bit to aid his aim and to keep himself safe. Combine that with the ability to ride motorcycles and drive all of the cars on the streets of Liberty City and the training to fly helicoptors and then the ability to use a good handful of weapons and you\\'ll end up with an idea of what Niko can do in combat and out. With all that Niko can do it\\'s sort of a surprise that Rockstar threw in this friendship concept. A handful of people will become your friend and want to do activities with you. These activities are mainly things like pool or bowling or just getting drunk, letting you watch Niko and said friend stumble around. The friend system has plenty of benefits but also plenty of annoyances. Calls can come at the wrong moments and you absolutely cannot say no. I\\'m glad my friends aren\\'t as spiteful as to think less of me when I say I\\'m too busy to do something with them. You can make the plan and then cancel it and they won\\'t dislike you for it but sometimes it would just be better to say no right up front than go through the rest of the trouble. If you keep your friends in high opinion you then you can gain extras from them, though these aren\\'t very big rewards. To access the reward, and many other things, you use your Cell Phone. Your Cell Phone allows you to call people, recieve texts, access the multiplayer menu, and more. You can customize it later in the game, though the options they give are extremely limited. The phone really isn\\'t a huge change in gameplay as much as it is the next step in the use of the cell phone from the previous installments. Nothing in Grand Theft Auto IV is revolutionary. It\\'s evolutionary. Taking the next step for the series. In taking these steps the game still has plenty of problems but nothing like the past. Once you get used to the new driving physics you\\'ll be navigating the streets fine. Once you get used to how Niko handles the game plays out rather easily. The missions you get to progress the main plot are often similar once you take off the extremely pretty wrapper. When you die you don\\'t lose your weapons anymore and can easily restart the mission from your cell phone right away. There are plenty of missions but most involve you driving and/or shooting someone. A few grander missions are littered throughout the game but they don\\'t change the other missions. One thing Rockstar did change was the radio. For better or worse you may find it less amusing or just as amusing as ever. The internet in-game can be explored and is full of many spoof-websites, while also letting you set up dates and/or missions. Rockstar also got professional comedians to put on shows in the game and there are some silly acts at a club that you can visit too. Televisions in your safe houses can be watched as well. These pieces of the game are all fitting and fine but they come off as the game not wanting to be played half the time. They are short enough to not be too big of an annoyance but you might end up skipping them as much as possible to go get drunk or cause random chaos.\\xa0 Random chaos, or rather crime in general, attracts law enforcement. And the new system for Liberty City\\'s finest is both good and bad. In a way it can be easier to avoid the cops now but it also can be more annoying. You have a flashing circle and all of the cops looking for you. If they can\\'t see you then you just have to make it outside the circle to escape. It can be very easy at times but then there are times when cops spawn at the wrong moments right nearby. And if they see you then the whole circle is centered on you again leaving you to escape their vision and then get out once more. A simple chase can go on too long due to this happening though for the most part the system works well and makes the game easier. The past games were hard due to problems in the gameplay more than actual difficulty so it is nice to see Grand Theft Auto cleaning itself up. No game gives you so much detail in the world. Liberty City looks beautiful and holds up against other 360 and PS3 titles nicely, and it still manages to give us an open world. The characters and pedestrians look great and the facial animations really help make Niko and the cast believable. There are some times where it seems awkward but most of the time the game doesn\\'t feel fake at all and just flows. Just wandering around Liberty City for hours to take in the sights is something that may interest you. The multiplayer aspect is decent but nothing more. They added plenty of modes but limited what you could do in them. The standard modes where you\\'re having a deathmatch come back. But then we get some co-op missions like Bomb Da Base II, which are actually quite nice if everyone is following the mission. Free Mode is probably the most disappointing because of just how empty the city is. None of the single player side features, like comedy clubs or drinking, make an appearance. You\\'re left alone with several friends in a massive city without any activities open. Lock On also can make killing others too easy. I\\'m not one for versus\\xa0 multiplayer though so take my word here with a grain of salt. ... I think that\\'s the term...\\xa0 The last complaint against this game one that the past games share as well. There is no mission replay feature. Once you beat the story you can\\'t start the missions over. Considering this is a brand new engine it is something Rockstar should have put in. But the overall experience of Grand Theft Auto IV is enough to forgive it\\'s absense. But if future titles continue to keep it out it will become a negative aspect just like it has for the later installments using the past engine. Combine the good and the bad and Grand Theft Auto IV finally leaps the gap to being good. Something it\\'s predecessors all tried and failed to do. It is legitimately a good game that focuses on quality over quantity and it pays off heavily in the end. ',\n",

       "  'description': \"ill just paint the picture of the original Jak and Daxter game. Its really cute a funny and very banjo kazooie or Crash bandacoot-y. So you pick up Jak II not expecting anything to different but the game starts by Jak beign TORTURED for 2 years and you automatically realize this is gonna be so different. You've been transported into this horrific version of the world from the first game, It is a Dystopian future if theres ever been one the poor are very poor and the rich are living a life of luxury of there backs. Ok so now to the actual review. The game unlike the previous game is free roam, open world more so than GTA amost. You can steal vehicles from people on the streets start police chases with the police officers so much more than you can imagine. When you start the game the city is most sealed off (also like GTA) and with subsiquent missions you unlock more and more of the city. You can venture out side of the city for missions but never into and area as big or as non-linear as the city.The story of the game has you getting involved with a rebellion and just snowballs from there on. It features some good quality voice acting and brilliant humour. The musical score is one worth mentioning aswell it works so well with the game, the enviroments change and with them the music in game does as well, the music also ramps up when your being chased by the police when battling foes which just adds to the suspense.The Graphics are very cartoony and have a brilliant contrast between the bright vibrant forest and the slums of the inner city. They are suprising stable aswell i encountered no pop up textures and ive played through it 3 times!!! I also noticed a virtually constant frame rate it does slow down but only if you cause major explosions it generally keeps at a steady rate. If you do have kids i would advise this game its not too challenging and dosent deal with too\\xa0 many adult concepts for a child not to grasp it its only a 12 pegi rating because of violence and swearing it says arse lets face it by 10 we all knew much worse words. I personally would have adorded this game when i was 10.IT's easy to put this game down as mearly a Kids GTA or just a copy of GTA but its so much more than that it has heart and sole and is a brilliant addition not only to Fans of Platformers but any ps2 gamer, Also with the price of ps2 games now you can pick it up for under £5 in places Theres no reason not to own this game.\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Review',\n",
       "  'description': '\\tPast Call of Duty games were set in World War 2 and often reacted the invasion of Normandy or the liberation of Europe. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare leaves the World War 2 era and blasts to modern times. Call of Duty 4 is a modern day first person shooter set in the middle east and Russia. Its currently the fourth installment of the Call of Duty series and lives up to the name brand. This game was in development for two years before its release date on the Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and PC.    Story Line:  \\tThe story line in this game is fictional but one would not recognize this if he was not in tune with modern news. This story line revolves around the United States, Russia, and the United Kingdom. A civil war has been torn in Russia by Russian ultra nationalists and they have used there power to stage a coup in the middle east. This story line is told in two perspectives but both relate to the main objective. The player will have the ability to play as a United States Marine and a British SAS.   \\tDuring the campaign you will overlap between the two characters you play. An example of this is the first level you play as a British SAS soldier and then the next level you will continue the storyline of a United States Marine. Infinity Ward did an amazing job with the transition of these two storyline into one. During game play the player will feel entangled in its storyline and unable to stop playing. To complete the campaigns in Call of Duty 4 one must follow a set of objectives and complete them. Upon doing so you will unlock other objectives and complete the map. A great feature in this storyline is the fact that the player will feel like they are in one big world, and not separate maps. Infinity Ward did an amazing job with this.    \\tGive or take this storyline will take around 8-10 hours to complete, depending on the gamer. Although the story line is short its packed with a ridiculous amount of game play and fun. Not once during the Campaign did I feel the need to stop playing because I was bored. You will constantly be doing something and its great story line will overshadow its length.  Multiplayer:  \\tThe main reason why most people bought this game was to play its extremely immersible multilayer. Whether it be on Xbox Live, PC, or Playstation Network, the Online portion of this game is really what its all about. Online Multilayer on Call of Duty 4 offers various game modes, such as deathmatch, team deathmatch, and other amazing modes. To win the team, or the player, must rank up the most points for them selves. They may also have a set of objectives to complete before winning the game. To assist there win players can call upon UAV, a Helicopter, or even an Air Strike. To obtain these useful assets the player must get a certain number of kills without dieing.    \\tCall of Duty 4 also offers customizable weapons and special abilities for each class. If the player wants to be an assault class he can pick his weapon, the color of it, and even attachments on it. The game also offers abilities called perks. Perks are special abilities one will have to help him get more kills. An example of a perk is steady aim, or even one to allow your bullets to do more damage. The player must unlock all these perks, weapons, and other customizable features to use them.    \\tThe ranking system on multilayer is extremely simple. Even if you win or loose a match you will get experience points to help you go to your next level. After each match you will win a set number of points that will be added on to your total. Once your total reaches a certain number you will rank up. You first start off as a NCM, that means a non officer. After a lot of game play you will reach the officer ranks. To add more game play Infinity Ward also added prestiige. Instead of capping the leveling at level 55 they now allow you to start all over again on level 1. The only difference is that you now start on Prestige rank 1. You can continue going to 55 then going to a new rank of prestige. This adds to the game play. A player does not have to go prestige, He or She can choose to stay 55.  ',\n",

       "  'description': 'First of, I am not going to write much (if anything) about the story, there is simply too much to cover, and neither should I write much about it, cause it could ruin the experience for you. But let me just say, it is great. It is not quite as a complex story like in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons Of Liberty, but it aint simple either. Perhaps you might want to have some knowledge about the series before you play it, or else it could be become a tad confusing. But I would say that, even if you have no clue over what is going on, you would still be entertained by the great gameplay.The game has five acts, that puts Solid Snake in different tasks and enviroments (so you are not just stuck in some forrest or building through out the game), and developes the story further and further. Some of the cinematics are quite long, which for some might not be to their liking, but they are so well crafted that you feel like you are watching a movie. The graphics are some of the best you will find in any game! And the same goes for the gameplay. You have pretty much endless ways to take out your enemy and such. And you can of course play the game in two ways. One way is to sneak your way through the game and the other is to blast your way through the game. The first one is of course the recommened one, cause in the end it is a stealth game. But the latter works fine as well, and is as good as any other \"real\" shooter game. It even has a first person view mode that you can use through out the whole game, if you intend to shoot your through.I can\\'t really find any negatives about this game, unless I really want to nitpick (which there is no real reason to). The music is still good, and is up too par with real hollywood blockbusters. The characters are great and collorful, and alot of time has been invested in them. Most of us remember the hate against Raiden in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons Of Liberty, and the rage over the fact that you spend the majority of the game as him. But this time I think we all can agree that he has become cool as hell, and you almost wish that you could play just one act as him. But in the end, it is Solid Snakes story and the story about his last mission... and a damn good one indeed. \\xa0 ',\n",

       "  'description': \"Nintendo Wii owner's finally get their hands on Super Smash Bros. Brawl after numerous delays. By the look of things around this site, it was worth the wait. With numerous modes found in the single player and multiplayer sides of the game, there is no question that this game will keep you busy for months, maybe years, on end. Also, the introduction of online play is a plus and will sustain a long life cycle to those who have their Wii connected to the internet.  The controls for this game are very simple to allow even the most novice players to be able to enjoy the brawl. With 4 different control schemes, (Wii remote, Wii remote and nun-chuck, classic controller and Gamecube controller), there is bound to be the perfect way for that someone to play. To many, it is suggested to dust off those Gamecube controllers because they seem to have a better button layout than the others. That doesn't mean that the other controls are not worth playing with as there is an option to customize the controller the way that is most comfortable.  The single player portion of Brawl has some returning modes as well as some newer ones. These modes are Events, Stadium, Training, Classic and the new Adventure Mode: The Subspace Emissary, which is said to be an estimated 8 hours long. The classic mode is what veterans to the Smash Bros. franchise will remember as going from stage to stage, beating up a certain character or characters and advancing to the final boss. The new adventure mode is quite entertaining, even though the controls can be a bit tedious in certain areas that include platforming on side scrolling or vertical scrolling levels, it barely takes away from the experience.  Surely, buying Brawl just for the single player is not recommended. The game really shines when brawling with up to 3 of your friends, either online or in person, or 3 randoms over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. With numerous modes and countless ways to customize them, it is easy to lose a whole day from just beating up your friends. With over 30 characters to choose from, there is bound to be that perfect brawler that awaits to be played.  What else can be said about Super Smash Bros. Brawl? With numerous modes and over 30 characters to play them with, it is easy to enjoy countless hours of this near perfect Smash Bros.. This game is by far, the best Nintendo multiplayer experience on the Wii this year. For those who have a Wii, get this game as soon as possible and for those who still need to find a Wii, don't worry because this game is bound to still have people playing for many months or even, years.\",\n",

The multi-directional punching works really well - you soon become adept at destruction, as well as propelling yourself around the screen from one building to the next. The satisfaction of devouring human flesh has certainly never been captured so brilliantly in a game. The downside to the game is that in the arcade original at least, you simply cannot avoid every bullet and granade fired at you - skill will only get you so far before you have to insert another coin. While longevity and variety soon becomes a problem, in terms of simple playability and co-op fun the game scores highly.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Final Fantasy X is the tenth instalment of Square\\'s highly regarded RPG series and it was the first to be released on the Playstation 2. As with every new game of the franchise, FFX features a completely new setting, story and cast of characters.  Main protagonist of the game is Tidus, star player of the blitzball team Zanarkand Apes, who sees his world destroyed by a giant tidal wave that seems to swallow the whole city of Zanarkand. Trying to escape, he teams up with his mentor Auron, who has been Tidus\\' only father figure ever since his old man Jecht disappeared several years ago. The follwing fights against a giant monster serves as a tutorial into the basics of the combat system, which is completely turn-based. However, your actions and stats affect the queue in which actions are taken. Whether you attack normally, use magic, special abilities or items can lead to additional hits before the enemy can make his move and makes battles very strategic. Tidus and Auron fight hard against the offspring of the being Auron calls \"Sin\", but are ultimately swallowed and literally washed away.The world of Spira is equally terrorized by Sin, mankind\\'s punishment for a war that destroyed the city of Zanarkand a thousand years ago. It is the task of the summoners to head on a pilgrimage to all the temples of Spira to prove worthy of the final aeon, a being so powerful it can destroy \"Sin\" and bring the Calm, a short period of peace until Sin is reborn. The young lady Yuna is the daughter of the last summoner to defeat \"Sin\" ten years ago and was about to leave the isle of Besaid with her guardians Lulu and Wakka when a young stranger is swept up, who claims to be from the city that laid in ruins for a thousand years. That man is of course Tidus who suddenly finds himself in a land unknown but joins the summoner on her journey that will lead them to the ruins of Zanarkand. Along the way, he grows closer to his companions, finds new allies and will discover the truth about Sin, Zanarkand and his very own existence.  As with all the Final Fantasy games, the gameplay is very story-driven and consists of not just the straight travels from temple to temple as you would expect. Many interesting and tragical things happen during your travels and force you to take unexpected paths. You will often encounter random battles and boss battles which take place in arenas designed to fit the theme of the location you\\'re currently in. One main difference between FFX\\'s combat system and that of previous instalments of the series is the fact that you can exchange party members during battle. This is necessary because of the game\\'s level up system called the sphere grid, a giant board with several hundred connected nodes. Characters start at different positions on that board and can move from node to node by using AP gained after battles. These nodes increase different stats of a character like HP, MP, Attack, Defence, Agility, Magic, etc as soon as they are unlocked by that character using corresponding spheres found in battle or treasure chests. Due to the positioning of these stat nodes, some characters will naturally strike with more force while casually miss more agile enemies. Another good example is Lulu, whose natural path follows several nodes with black magic spells and will therefore be needed to defeat foes with high defence but weakness against elemental damage. In time (and long grinding), all characters can get equally powerful at everything, but this will take you far beyond the story. Yuna is the character that stands out as she is the only one able to summon the many aeons achieved throughout the game (up to 10, although the Magus Sisters always fight together as a trio). After an impressive summoning sequence, the complete party will leave the battlefield and the aeon will fight alone. You can assign various commands and in time, teach them new ones. When an aeon dies or is told to retreat manually, the battle continues with your normal party. The game clocks in at about 40 hours for the story, but FFX features many additional side quests that can easily push the game to 150 hours and more. The international version of the game (released in PAL regions and re-released in Japan) features even more content in the dark aeons and the sheer unkillable Penance with its 12\\'000\\'000 HP (yes, that\\'s a lot).  Graphically, FFX was one of the best-looking games of its release year and still holds up excellently, especially considering the PS2\\'s weaker hardware compared to other current-gen consoles. Everything is rendered in full 3D as opposed to the PSOne\\'s Final Fantasy games (let alone earlier episodes of the franchise). Locations range rom island settings, to enchanted forests, wide plains, large cities, mountain trails and of course, the ruins of Zanarkand. Characters are very detailed, although the less important characters fall somewhat flat compared to the main characters. There are also several levels of rendering detail depending on the scenes and close up shots of the lower poly-count models look a bit outdated nowadays. Additionally, FFX again features some of the best CG sequences seen in video gaming, used to make several scenes especially memorable.  FFX is also the first game of the series to feature voice acting and does a fairly good job at it. Although some people don\\'t like some of the voices used, they match the characters and make them very expressive and emotional. The musical score of the game is at very high level and can easily compete with its predecessors (which are always considered among the best). All the background songs create an excellent atmosphere and are beautiful to listen to outside of the game as well. The song contributed by Nobuo Uematsu and performed by Japanese singer Rikki called \"Suteki Da Ne\" stands out the most and is actually played from start to end during an escpecially touching CG sequence in the middle of the game.  With a current save game at 170 hours after several finished story-replays, Final Fantasy X is easily the PS2 game I spent the most time with and not a single second feels wasted. That said, it\\'s one of the most impressive RPGs of its console generation and well worth a try.',\n",

       "  'description': 'First things first, this is a very good game with nice graphics, a decent soundtrack and realism but Rockstar has made the game too realistic for its own good and as a result has lost some of its GTA zing. Part of the fun in playing the previous titles was the crazy vehicles and free roaming which have been really toned down which has come as a shock to many including myself after playing San Andreas. Most of GTA iV you are confined to the streets seeing the same boring style of buildings which can make the game feel one dimensional, the only respite being the helicopters which can be fun flying in and out of the buildings but that gets old fast. Speaking of helicopters the only outlandish vehicle reminiscent of past titles is the attack chopper which features machine guns, besides that the vehicles are average and after a while travelling the city becomes a chore that the taxi\\'s are a god send.  Some other features that were not included since San Andreas are car customisation much to the dismay of many, while not essential to the game it is a nice touch. Just like the more clothing choice and the RPG elements no longer present.  The great thing people loved about other GTA games was the completely ridiculous and over the top missions like stealing a jet pack from a secret government base in the desert. The missions in GTA IV are repetitive with only a handful of over 90 missions actually standing out as really enjoyable, notably \"Three Leaf Clover\", the majority being kill someone or follow someone then kill them.  I think this game became way over hyped which has let many down. This has left an opening for Grand Theft Auto\\'s rivals, notably Saints Row 2 (released later this year), which claimed by many to be a GTA clone, has retained the appeal that the previous games in the series possessed.',\n",

       "  'description': \"I don't know what it is about clicking on stuff, anywhere and everywhere on the screen, but in Diablo 2 it's incredibly addicting. The game is separated into 4 different acts, each taking place in a unique environment with its own different monster set and area layout. Even though each of the areas and dungeons are randomly generated every time a new game is created, they each manage to maintain a distinct feel specific to that particular environment. Sewers, for example, are full of short narrow passages that lead to small rooms whereas caves are a bit more open, leaving a bit more space to run around. The weapons and armor are just as varied. Though there are a set amount of weapon and armor classes in the game, each can have varying stats, be it various types of elemental damage, stat boosts or empty 'slots' for further customization. Like the weapon classes, there are several character classes to choose from as well. Ranging from the melee-centric Barbarian to the monster-summoning Mage, there's a class to suit almost everyone's tastes.The one thing that I could never really stand in the game was the relatively small amount of space in the inventory. Sure it may seem like plenty at the start of the game, but as players move from act to act gathering more and more items, the lack of space becomes present. This will force players to either drop items or trek back to town to sell them off - either way having to continue on without them.The game holds up pretty well after all these years. The sounds are clear, varied and well-acted and the graphics still look decently detailed and manage to do a good job presenting what the developers envisioned. The game's presentation is straightforward and simple. Finding and selling items is just as addictive as clicking to attack the monsters. All in all, Diablo 2 is not a bad way to spend what little gaming time people may have nowadays. It's easy to pick up and play and there are several good stopping points along the way. It's a great diversion to check out while waiting for Diablo 3.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"If you like Nintendo, you will love Super Smash Bros. Brawl! It has a huge character roster. Bigger than any other fighting game to date. Some of the characters are pretty identical though. The game gives you a nice amount of characters to start with and you will eventually unlock more as you progress through the game.A new feature to the game is the Subspace Emissary mode. This is basically the single player mode of the game. Although you can play it with a friend as well. This mode plays like a side scroller so unfortunately the fighting gameplay sometimes doesn't work so well with it. It is fairly long. It should take you around 8-10 finishing it. As you progress you will see amazing cutscenes. Which is really the only reason you will play through it. Except from unlocking the rest of the characters. It really gets boring after awhile.SSBB definetly looks better then most Wii games. The character models are well detailed. The stages are also awesome with beautiful soundtracks.Fortunately the game online. Unfortunately it doesn't work so well. When we first bought the game it took around 10 mins to find only 1 person. But after awhile I started finding people much quicker. Still it takes around 2 minutes to find 3 other people. There is no way to customize how you want to play. The time is fixed, so are the rules. You can't communicate with the ones you are playing with in any way. Online is pretty much lag free, for me atleast. It depends on your connection and the ones your playing with.Although if you have a friend who also has the game the online is awesome. You can customize all the rules and time. No lag. And its just for fun to play with people you know rather than strangers.This game has A LOT of unlockables. Hundreds of trophies and stickers. Dosens of characters and stages. And around 300 soundtracks. Its just incredible!Overall this game is a must buy for any Wii owner who has friends or family willing to play with you. The online definetly needs improvement. But its still ok.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"First off, the thing that many people will first notice when opening the game up for the first time is the attachment for the 4 fret buttons to be hooked into the DS. When first putting your hand through the strap and aligning it just right so it feels comfortable can be a little hassle. Once strapped in, pull out that pick and strum over the guitar strings on the touch screen to the notes falling down on the other. Be prepared to experience some missing notes and such while getting used to it but once you get the hang of it, it plays well and you can start having fun.  The most important thing about any music game is, well, the music. To be honest, I was a bit disappointed by the 25 song length in the game. The music ranges from Ozzy to Maroon 5 so if you don't like to have a nice variety, which I do like, then you may be disappointed to hear that the game isn't all hard rock anthems. All together, the list is great for a portable game that tells you to not play the game for long periods of time.  The graphics are okay, but is that really important?  The features are good. In single player, you have Career, Quickplay, Guitar Duels (kind of a guitar battle career mode), Practice and Tutorials. For multiplayer, you have Face-off, Pro Face-off, Co-op and Guitar Duel (battle mode). The downfall with the multiplayer is that it is not online, but it is fine for playing with friends and all the features are exactly like their console .  As a total package, Guitar Hero On Tour is a great first attempt at a Guitar Hero game for the DS and worth the $50. The controls are great once you get used to them and the graphics are okay, but who really cares that much. There could have been some more songs to make the game longer but from the songs that you get, it is a nice variety and satisfying as a portable game. Let's just hope that the next one will have more songs and online play but for what you get, it is recommended for new comers and veterans alike.\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'Dungeon Keeper 2 review by Termite',\n",
       "  'description': 'Game Review: Dungeon Keeper 2Dungeon Keeper 2 was released in 1999 by Bullfrog Productions ( Now owned by EA ). It is the sequel to Peter Moleneux\\'s Dungeon Keeper, which was released in 1997.The game has you, the Dungeon Keeper, creating a dungeon and fighting the heros who are trying to cleanse hell of evil. You start off with a dungeon heart ( Which is literally a beating heart ) and a few imps. These imps are capable of digging out rock and mining gold, making them very important.You also find portals, which basically act as hell super highways and they allow monsters to get into your dungeon. The monsters you attract into your service depends on the living conditions of your dungeon. If you have a workshop, you have a chance to get trolls. All of the creatures you can command have some sort of room specific demand. Warlocks for example require a library.This whole system works very well, and is executed nicely as well.Graphics are very nice ( For it\\'s time ). The rooms are all very well modeled and have a nice ambiance to them thanks to the lighting effects. Animation is also good.Sound is great, mostly because of the narrator / mentor guy\\'s voice. I think the way he says \"Game saved\" will be stuck in my mind forever. Other than that the sounds heros and creatures make are also well done, as is the background sound ( Screaming and such ).Gameplay is fantastic! Dungeon Keeper 2 executes the whole \"You are a god\" thing very well. Using your cursor (Which is a hand) you can pick up creatures and slap them around and do all sorts of cool things. The dungeon really feels like it is alive with creatures going to and a fro to perform their duties. Watching your creatures duking it out with enemies is a joy, and the developers understood that so they put in the my pet dungeon mode. This mode allows you to create a dungeon from scratch without any time limits and basically make your masterpiece dungeon. I spent hours and hours doing this, and it never got old.Overall, the atmosphere, the gameplay, everything just makes the game what it is. It is the total package really, and it is just....fantastic.Game rating: 5/5',\n",

       "  'description': \"With the emergence of Gears of War 2 coming near, I decided to invest in the first game to get acquainted with the series. I can say that like me if you missed out on this game the first time around I implore you to get this game for yourself.   The one quality of the game that resonated with me the most was the gun play and cover mechanics. While the total arsenal of weaponry is rather small, you can tell that each one was painstakingly crafted and tuned. You have your standard assault rifles, shotguns, snipers, pistols; however there are some unique ones in the mix. By now you have obviously heard of the chainsaw bayonet which shreds your foes in a spectacular display of blood and gore. One of the more unique weapons is called the Hammer of Dawn, this gun uses satellites to rain death from above; this is quite a funny sight to see. Each weapon feels extremely powerful and devastating; it makes you feel bad for the foes at the business end of your gun.   The other game play aspect that is integral to the experience is the use of cover. This differentiates Gears from your typical run and gun method of play. On the Casual difficulty, you can easily plow your way through the enemies without much consequence. However on the Hardcore and Insane difficulties cover becomes essential to surviving. The cover introduces a light tactical consideration but also does not clunk down the intense gunplay.   Both of these game play aspects make playing the campaign extremely entertaining to play. While it is fun by yourself, the best way to experience this game is to play co-op with a friend. Having your friend as a competent partner can mitigate the normal stupidity of your AI controlled allies. Co-op play also improves the experience because you and your friend can revive each other in order to lower the amount of game over screens you'll encounter.   The last aspect I want to address is the competitive online modes. This late after the games release means that only the most elite players are left. This means that it is extremely hard to get into the multi-player. I tried to play a few games but ended up being completely decimated by the competition. This might just mean that I am terrible at the game but since I do play a lot of games I think that a lot of people will be even worse off than me. I'm not saying that it is impossible but unless you are ready for an extremely steep learning curve I would avoid online play.   With the new reduced price of Gears you have no excuse to play this game. While the online play is fairly out of reach, the campaign is so fun to play that it is worth the price of entry. Gears of War is one of the best shooters that any fan of games should pick up.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"The Good: If the core combat wasn't perfected before it certainly has been now, some of the best animations in the business, finally features real successive play , longer than the first game, improved interface, great boss fights, great new weapon additions, amazing cutscenes, incredibly brutal.The Bad: Water combat is more frustrating than fun, suffers from some performance issues, no stand alone challenge mode, some boring levels, the Ninja Cinema feature doesn't work very well.Since I had beaten Ninja Gaiden for the original Xbox 4 years ago a game that I hold as one of my absolute favorites ever I've been highly anticipating the sequel, I've even played trough the remakes Black and Sigma and even Dragon Sword for the Nintendo DS to try to make the wait a little bit easier. Now that sequel is finally here but when I saw the review scores coming in I thought I was gonna be disappointed, and I was...but only very slightly. Ninja Gaiden II is an amazing action/adventure title and definitely a worthy sequel to the original.The core gameplay structure of Ninja Gaiden for the original Xbox remains the same but for most the time everything ramped up to eleven. The combat which is the major strongpoint of this series is where most of the improvements lies which is impressive since I thought the combat in the previous game was as perfect it ever could be, well I was wrong.The combat in Ninja Gaiden II is way more brutal and faster then ever and it sticks more closely of the ninja way of being able to take your foe out with very few attacking moves.Most of this is thanks to the new so called Obliberation Techniques, almost every attack you'll make will result in the enemy loosing a limb and after that you can take them out right away with an incredibly stylish finishing move. Be warned though, enemies will become more aggressive and suicidal after they have lost a limb knowing they cannot return home, and all they can do is to simply take you out with them. So I would advice you to always try to pay attention to your enemies as in the last game actually all of them oppose a real threat.There has been a few new weapons added in this game and they all are very fun to use and feel very well balanced too. And all the older weapons that make their return now much more fun to use aswell as they now have more combos and some have been reworked. There is only really only one weapon that I miss from the last game and that is the sword called Keitsu, it would have been very nice to see it here but I can live without it.The use of Ninpo aka ninja magic has been greatly improved as well. Not only does it look way more impressive when you use them but you can now aim your attack a bit more precisely to deal most of the damage out on a more powerful foe rather to the one that is standing closest to you. They also work better now to make you get trough some really though and intense situations than before and it's definitely worth it to upgrade your magic aswell for even greater effect. You can also now change your equipment on the fly thanks to the improved interface. By simply using the d-pad you can directly take a potion or change your weapon or ninpo without taking you out of the experience and having to remember where all the enemies are positioned. There was a similar system in Sigma though but you could only pretty much use potions and since the game did not stop you would much rather use the Start Button Menu as you simply don't often have the time to look trough and use your what you have with the d-pad while in the middle of a fight.The previous game also had some frustrating sections when platforming as you often had to line up your jumps with the camera. The platforming is still here but it's lighter and most of it is optional to find hidden items within the environment compared to the first game where you had to pass some of these frustrating sections to be able to progress.The puzzles are lighter aswell but sometimes a bit too light. For example you find a look door only to find out the key is in the next room meaning it will sometimes only take you less than a minute to unlock that door sure, but it's an unnecessary way to break off the pace.Before you also ran into these so called Fiend Challenges without really knowing it and you ended up fighting enemies in a room for a time that would seem like forever. These have been made optional aswell by finding portals that will take you to an arena like environment.The last game had some free-roaming elements but this game is more straighforward with branching paths mostly leading the hidden items.This isn't too bad though as it feels a bit more like the old-school Ninja Gaiden games and you'll travel to many different places around the world too.Besides the free-roaming aspects was pretty much fake as you always had to go to a certain place to progress, while it was cool to see how some environments changed over time there was sometimes confusion on where you had to go next and this game has less of that. Sure it would have been cool if this game had featured some real free-roaming but I personally don't mind this design.The Ninja Gaiden games has always had very responsive controls and they even feel even a bit more responsive here, at least the movements with the analog sticks making some special moves easier to nail. There was only one thing about the controls that took a while getting used to for me personally. And that is that the first person camera view is now entered by holding the left bumper instead of clicking the right analog stick and to be honest I prefer the old way and having the Karma score mapped on the left bumper which in this game has to be enabled in the options menu by hitting the back button.The camera of this series is something that is often brought up for discussion, some hate it and some don't.The camera in this game mostly remains the same with some improvements here and there but there are also things about it that aren't as good as before.For example you can tweak it some in the option menu, in bossfights you can change to camera to not be locked on the boss which it always was in previous games, the camera view when using your bow is way better and you can now a lot easier aim your ninpo as mentioned before, you also now control the camera when charging up an ultimate attack with the left analog stick as your right hand is busy but for some reason you can't change the vertical angle.Also when you try to change vertical angle otherwise the camera now autocenters when you let go of the analog stick but it does not do it for some reason when the game it self gives you a bit odd vertical angle.Ryu and his enemies also now moves faster than before so you will have to recenter it a bit more now with the right trigger on your controller.So it's pretty much the same thing as before meaning the camera certainly isn't great but not horrible either, it simply takes a while getting used to.The difficulty is something that is often discussed as well. The level of difficulty of this game is for the most of the time improved. The easier difficulty setting is easier than before and the harder ones are harder to both please newcomers and hardcore players.Ultimate techniques won't be interrupted by weaker enemy attacks, you now always get back a bit of your health back after each fight reducing the use of potions that brakes of the pace a bit and the save points are more frequent than ever before and they will also fully restore your health. The game also often auto saves before a major boss fight to ease of some even more frustration. You also start off a lot more powerful which is a big improvement over the previous game and health upgrades can strategically be used as health potions as your health bar will not only get longer now but fully restored. Don't get me wrong though this game is as challenging as ever so you will have to try to pay attention as much as possible to the enemy movements and attacks. There are very many bossfights in this game and most of them are really great but the trade-off for them being so many is that they can vary in difficulty. Some of them along with some enemies can even be a bit cheap. For example there are enemies that will constantly spam you with rockets meaning you have to constantly evade and all the explosions make it a bit harder to see what is going on and there is even a boss at the end of chapter 7 that will explode upon death taking you down with it. As enemies has been exploding trough out that chapter already( an amazing chapter by the way ) you can pretty much see it happening. What is annoying though is to figure out on how to avoid it and I will tell you this know to save some frustration, you simply stand still and hold down the block button.The combat on water can be pretty frustrating as well as you have to tap the A button all the time to keep moving and in Sigma you only had to move the analog stick to accomplish the same thing.But for the most part this game provides the right amount of challenge.The story in this game isn't really all that interesting and it never has been for the most part when it comes to this series. However the cutscenes using the in-game engine can be pretty amazing so you can actually end up paying attention to what's going on anyways even though the plot isn't very deep and fairly predictable. The voice work isn't too bad either, I especially like the voice of the Greater Fiend under the name of Volf.The graphics in this game are great especially the effects with blood going everywhere and using Ultimate Techniques can be very cool to watch not to mention the animations ranks upon with the best I've seen in all of gaming.The graphics unfortunately tend to be pretty uneven though. Sometimes the lighting can look really flat and basic, some environments look completely bland and lifeless, the art direction is sometimes off with things looking completely bizarre or even silly and blood can end up floating in the air stuck on nothing. There are also some performance issues, in chapter 2 for example the game sometimes started to load or freeze in the middle of a fight even give me a completely white screen for a couple of seconds or started to go in to slowmotion. This almost wanted be to stop playing the game as it felt so unfinished but after that I did not experience anymore problems except for maybe a screen tear here and there until the later chapters where there would be some some short slowdown again but then there was also a ton lot more going on screen so that was more acceptable but still an annoyance. This surprised me as games from Team Ninja always bring you game that are very well polished, and I did fear this a little bit as they did not delay it as they often do with their games. If this had to do with the games' producer Itagaki leaving the company or pressure from Microsoft I do not know but hopefully this will be fixed later with a patch or something.There are times though when everything completely works though including the art, great looking environments, textures and lightning with a rock solid framerate and some bodies will stay on the ground even after you have left there area which is very impressive ( try backtracking sometime to see it yourself ). When this occurs it can be a completely mindblowing game to look at. Because of these issues though the game barely looks any better than Ninja Gaiden Sigma for the Playstation 3. Meaning it still looks great but I did except it to look a bit better.The sound is very good, I really like the sound effects of the weapons and when they connect to the enemies hearing skulls crack and such and also the music is well composed fits really well with the action on screen.As far as value goes this game is actually longer than the original and longer games are always welcome. The trade-off here is that there are some levels that are a bit boring for example there is a part in chapter 9 where you run around in a tight cave that looks bad, is not very fun to be in, the camera is annoying, it's hard to tell which direction is the right one and there is also a glitchy worm boss. Thankfully the majority of the chapters are really amazing.After you have beaten the game you unlock two more difficulty settings and these games are always fun to play again on a harder difficulty settings if you can handle the challenge as things will change as you go trough it. You can also play trough the game again on the setting you have beaten it on keeping all your upgraded equipment. This is a great addition to the game that I always felt was missing from previous games, there are even achievements for playing trough the while game with a certain weapon. The only thing I could complain about this feature is that you can not choose the chapter you want to play right away.There is also a new feature called Ninja Cinema which will let you record your progress and upload it to share with others. This sounds better in theory though than it is in practice as compared to the replay system in Halo 3 for example you can not pause, rewind, fast forward, change the camera angle or even remove the bloody heads up display. The only thing you can do basically is to add a black/white filter that will make it look a bit like and old Japanese ninja splatter movie. The framerate will also take a noticeably hit while you record. In the end this features only really serves the purpose of showing others how to get trough a certain chapter or beat a certain boss.The game also lacks a stand alone challenge mode. Ninja Gaiden Black has a mode called Mission Mode where you right away could jump into a fight or challenge a boss. It was great as it was something you could just play for a couple of minutes before leaving for work for example and improving your highscore was pretty addicting aswell. Sigma also had this mode and some other modes available as downloadable content.I'm sure this game will get modes like this downloadable aswell later on but it would have been nice to have had something like this on the disc.In the end Ninja Gaiden II is a truly amazing game only lacking the same level of polish as the original along with a few extra modes for added value.Despite these drawbacks the game still manages to be barely superb and it delivers some of the very best action found on the system and is a must have for fans and others should try/rent or download the demo found on the Xbox Marketplace to see if they're up for the challenge that awaits.//ZimpanX\",\n",

       "  'description': \"When i first hear Mario Kart was coming to the Wii I felt a bit strange since I didn't like Mario Kart Double Dash as much as I like Mario Kart DS, if you ask me; I'm all into the one character per Kart gameplay, so at first with the GC installment I was kind of shocked.  Now I can safely say Nintendo has gone back to basics with this game, you once again see one character per kart but you can choose different Karts, also Mario kart Wii has the biggest grid I've seen, 12 karts go head to head to win the o so precious Mushroom Cup, yes 12 freaking karts, it's a bit much when you see the amount of items that can be thrown at you, especially when you're going first. Nevertheless the game is as fun as it has always been, you'll spend about 10 to 15 hours to clear the entire game, not much but if you see at the other features included you will be playing this game much longer.  One of this features is online play, and unlike the one Nintendo introduced in Brawl, this actually works fine when you're playing against someone who isn't on your friend list, as it is ranked you can expect to play against people of your level and not get kick in the ass by some 17 year old Japanese guy as to what happen in Mario Kart DS, even though you can play freely pretty much against anyone. The connection works beautifully when playing I only experience some minor lag but not something one cant handle.  Another feature is the Mario Kart Channel where you can check friend rankings, download ghost data and regional and worldwide stats. It's a functional channel if you're the competitive type who wants to know who is next to beat and to see if you're top amongst your friends.  As if karts weren't enough you can know choose from a variety of motorbikes, which vary in different stats. When on a motorbike you can perform a wheelie for a momentous speed boost but when performing a wheelie your turning radius will decrease, in contrast a kart gets a speed boost by drifting, which in my opinion is much better that a wheelie.  Regarding the new battle mode I'm not so sure if everyone will like it, as you are split into teams, nevertheless you still have the seam ol' three balloons as in previous games but the score is different as it is not individual, you can loose all three balloons and you don't die, you keep re-spawning until a team wins.  Finally the Wii Wheel quite an achievement, I thought it would suck but no, it actually feels good to play with it, so if you're a Mario Kart fan you should buy this game and if it is your first time, you will love it.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"To get straight to the point, Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved is flat out fun. You control your ship with the left analog stick while shooting in many directions with the right analog stick. This simple control scheme works amazingly well when getting mobbed by a screen full of baddies, but when the going gets tough, just hit one of the left or right trigger buttons to unleash a bomb that clears the screen to ensure a second of safety. The game does a good job of keeping a steady frame rate when all that you are seeing on the screen is a mountain of mayhem with dozens of enemies and explosions on the screen at once.  The visuals are great when your are playing in the Evolved mode rather than the retro mode because obviously, the retro mode is based on a simple layout which tends to be very bland. The main mode you will want to play is the Evolved mode which looks amazing when there are many things exploding on screen that lights up any room. For only $5, or 400 Microsoft points, it would be hard to pass up this addicting shooter that anyone can play due to the very simple controls and concept. Give it a try by downloading the demo on Xbox Live and see how many times you come back to play it, you won't be disappointed.\",\n",

Music is scanned from your computer, by the game, into the game.\\xa0 There is a good variety of characters, which determine difficulty and have their own unique abilities, this leaves everything feeling balanced.\\xa0 Because of the character-specific abilities, even if\\xa0 you choose the same song you just played, if you choose a different character, the level can play in a completely different fashion.\\xa0 An example is the Mono car, which has perhaps the simplest concept, but can be tough to play as if you want it's specific bonus.\\xa0 As well, the highways grow narrower with higher difficulty, making the game that much harder.\\xa0 These factors bring a depth to the gametype that you probably will not see anywhere else.\\xa0\\xa0 I'm not sure what to call the game's art style, suffice it to say that it has a futuristic feel, but it is anything but the drab palette of other games.\\xa0 The visual design is fun to just look at and enjoy, and there is a Free Ride mode where you can just ride the highway, listening to the music and watching the colors.\\xa0 Despite flashy graphics and bright colors, the game is not too demanding of a video card, which is always a plus.\\xa0\\xa0 I'm not completely sure of what to say about the game's audio, except that it is widely varied.\\xa0 If you want to play a specific song, you only need to have it on your computer.\\xa0 There is also Audiosurf Radio, which is a great way to sample music from different bands.\\xa0 The songs on the Radio are updated periodically, but also featured is the Audiosurf Overture, which is always listed. A nice bonus of the game being developed for Steam is that included with it is the entire Orange Box soundtrack, with both versions of Still Alive, which is as much fun to play as it is to listen to.\\xa0\\xa0 While the game has no real multiplayer mode besides the 2-player Double Vision character, the game is all about leaderboards.\\xa0 The score you get at the end of a level is calculated, appropriate bonuses are rewarded, and your score is posted on the leaderboard for that song's difficulty.\\xa0 There you can see who got which bonuses, how long their song was, and even if their track was different.\\xa0 The leaderboards feel more like they are there to see who listens to the same songs and how good they are at perhaps a certain character, rather than something that drives players to be the best overall.\\xa0 Despite this, individual songs have great replay value. If it's a song you enjoy listening to, then you will probably enjoy playing it repeatedly with different characters, difficulties, and bonuses.\\xa0\\xa0 Audiosurf is a great game for any music lover, and because you can play pretty much any kind of song you want with it, it has appeal to a wide range of players.\\xa0 If you don't care about leaderboards, you don't have to. Just play for fun. That's what this game is all about.\",\n",

       "  'description': ' In Assassins Creed you play as Altair. You are part of a brotherhood of Assassins that are on a quest to protect the holy land from the invading crusaders. Assassins Creed is a game that will bring you along on a unique adventure unlike any other.  At this point if you have heard of Assassins Creed you know about the \"twist\". In reality you play Desmond who is a test monkey for some kind of evil cooperation. Extremely early in the game you find out that these mysterious scientists are holding you captive in order to get information on your ancestor, Altair. So therefore you must relive Altair\\'s life in order to obtain the correct \"information\".  While playing you are thrust into one of three massive cities. Being as Assassin gives you the ability to scale buildings in a fashion that would put Spiderman to shame. Altair will fluidly scale massive towers grabbing rails and scaffolding without any hesitation. This is by far the best part of Assassins Creed; the platforming game play in this game completely elevate the genre and sets a new benchmark that will be tough be match and even harder to surpass.  While the cities themselves are a superb achievement the events going on within the city are rather disappointing. Whenever you go to a new part of the city you must follow a set routine. First you must get to a high point and survey the surrounding area. Secondly you must collect information on your target. In order to get this information you do one of four things. You can eavesdrop on chatty citizens to get the scoop. Pick pocketing an important document is another possible objective, or you can beat the information out of talkative individuals. While these three objectives make sense in terms of collecting information there is another type that make me confused. There are fellow assassins littered throughout the city that want you to complete objectives for them in exchange for information. However these objectives are so dumb; you either have to finish off their assassination duties for them, or collect the flags that they seem to misplace every single time you talk to them. This might not seem like much but I have one question, whats the point of collecting your stupid flags?  Regardless once you\\'re done with those you have to go and assassinate your main target. These also seem to go by some sort of loose routine. You must find your target wade through the crowd of people and go in for the kill. Once everyone notices the corpse on the ground twenty guards show up to brawl. This brings me to my next topic of discussion, the combat. Early off in the game you spend most of the time mashing on the X button until dudes die. Eventually you will build up a repertoire of moves that will make you a very formidable opponent. However there is one move that seems a little overpowered, the counter attack just has you patiently guarding until someone on attacks you and you counter which gives you the one hit kill. Then you can just wait as each guard approaches you in an orderly fashion each eagerly awaiting their turn to review a good slash to the face.  While this is fun and exciting the first time around, you soon realize that this cycle will repeat a total of eleven times. Around the third time the cycle starts to become extremely tiresome. This is the major thing about Assassins Creed. Your tolerance to repeat this cycle will determine the amount of enjoyment that you will be able to get out of Assassins Creed. For most people I would recommend you borrow or rent this game first. Assassins Creed is not a game that is necessarily worth the sixty dollar price. In the end the amount of time you can stay immersed in the world will dictate how far you will go with this game. Whether or not you get to the end, everyone should at least experience this game.

       "  'description': 'Positives:- Perfect for DBZ fans, especially if you enjoyed the original Budokai series- Great visuals- Cool super attacks- The addition of drama pieces are a good ideaNegitaves:- Online play can be laggy if using a cross country connection and definitely not enough there to keep you coming back- You probably wont enjoy this and definitely wont know what\\'s going on if your not a DBZ fan- Only includes the first three sagas- Drama pieces and rank requirements get repetitive fastDragonBall Z: Burst Limit is your typical \"hey it seems people don\\'t like our current games, maybe we should take a step back\" game. After the garbage that was the Tenkaichi series, Atari decided that maybe the original Budokai series has something that could possible be done again. What I mean from this is that instead of the 3D fighting areas and battle/combat style they had been doing for the last three console games, they went back to just 2D fighting in a 3D environment.Burst Limit is unlike a game such as Street Fighter and more on the Soul Calibur side of things, minus ring outs. It has you fighting one other enemy on a 2D plain but at the same time lets you move in a 3D way to create yet another 2D plain. If this confuses you, don\\'t worry, it doesn\\'t really matter. This element of battle and game play is much like the original three Budokai games and pretty much mimics the basic idea of them all.The single player mode has you going through different \\'scenes\\' in the DBZ show/movie history and recreating them in a one on one fight. Along with some good looking cut scenes, it makes for a pretty good time. One thing it doesn\\'t seem to realize is that there are people out there who either don\\'t know what DragonBall Z or don\\'t care enough to have watched all one million episodes and don\\'t know the story line. It has you going through each fight in the correct order based off the show through each of the first three sagas of DBZ (yes thats right, it ends after the cell saga) but what it doesn\\'t do it tell you what\\'s going on and why each of these things are happening. Unless you have watch the show, you have no idea how and why these characters are beating the crap out of each other. What makes this element worse is the game decides that you can finally get the privilege of knowing these answers after you finish the around twenty something fights that make up a saga by use of a voiceless cut scene.Aside from that, Burst Limit doesn\\'t really have many other great flaws. As stated, it revisits it\\'s original roots but that\\'s what makes it so great. Once you drop the giant 3D arenas in which causes you to have to try and use the environment as more of a weapon than what the show was really about (your fists and energy) you can get back to actually back to what DBZ is actually about, hitting people really hard. This game should make most fighting genre fans happy and should please DBZ fans all around.The graphics of this game are very good, and combining that with the monstrous flashing lights that people into the game and show will know as energy attacks, your in for quite a good looking game. Some of the stronger attacks look really good when shown on these powerful consoles and well surpass the Budokai series. Some of the better light shows will be seen when two powerful attacks collide and the sparks are flying everywhere.Also this game involves online play, so you can battle with your friends or anyone. One thing that lacks here is there is some lag to the fights if your not in the same country and the person. Aside from straight one on one fighting online, there isn\\'t much else to do. Though there really couldn\\'t be to much else to put online so overall the online component isn\\'t a wonderful feature that will have you coming back to the game.Probably the biggest point about this game s its use of in fight cut scenes known as \"drama pieces.\" These stop the fight when you meet certain components and cause a short, maybe less than 8 second cut scene. At first these are a cool idea, but then you will begin to notice that they do the same maybe dozen scenes over and over and they\\'re not even a little different. The only different is the character performing it, other than that they just pasted a different body onto the motion path.Another add on is the requirements that your ranking per fight is based on. These are things like \"perform an ultimate attack\" or \"finish while destroying the battle field\" which once again, start off as a cool idea and will make you want to try and meet as many as you can. By meeting enough or these, your overall ranking for that fight will increase. The downside to these is that they never ever change. For every fight you can just do the same thing to meet the same requirements and you will usually get the same ranking. It would have been real nice to see some storyline/character specific requirements thrown in there.Overall this game meets the standards you\\'d want if your a DBZ fan but will come up as shallow and not worth while for others. Though it does have a lot to do if your wanting to finish every fight and get a good rank on each one of their difficulties. The online play is a must have section to this game but wont last long for you and definitely wont have you coming back to this game over and over.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Red Steel was the quintessential tech demo for the Wii. We thought it impossible for Ubisoft to disappoint with such an interesting idea that made full use of the Wii's intuitive controllers. Many, many months later, most people have moved on, but this title still leaves a sour taste in Wii launch victims' collective mouth.   In Red Steel, you are Scott, boyfriend of the daughter of a Yakuza ringleader. The story begins with Scott and his girlfriend on the eve of the announcement of their engagement. After an enemy gang busts in, delaying the announcement, and a brief tutorial explains the basics of controlling Scott, the player has to dispatch some baddies to save his virtual fiancé.\\xa0  This tutorial is simple enough, but it betrays the player's trust by leading An image for the sake of image!him/her on to looking forward to playing the game. Turning Scott is an unpleasant chore, while clumsily holding in the A button and  thrusting the Wiimote towards the screen to zoom is a mechanic that could have been better mapped. The gun play is just as disappointing, with the lack of precision and all.   Shortly after killing some basic, gat-wielding enemies, and swapping out the handgun for some more evolved weaponry, the Way-of-the-Samurai is explained to the player by his/her e-father-in-law. Scott's skill with a blade improves over the  course of the game and new moves become available, but they are wholly unnecessary. The sword fighting is similar to  a turn-based   strategy game in that you block, attack, the enemy blocks, counter-attacks, rinse, repeat. Later, these katana  duels become frustratingly difficult as enemies continually block  attacks and stab the player: a move Scott is, for some reason, unable to mimic. After defeating an enemy and bringing him to his knees, the player makes one of two choices: killing douche; an unsatisfying choice considering the lack of Kill Bill-style fountains of blood, or sparing his life via a wave of the Nunchuk. By letting the downed opponent be, respect is earned.  Another! As the story progresses, this respect can be spent on new skills. The player can, at the press of a button, stop time and shoot the weapons out of enemies' hands: netting Scott more expendable respect. This mixes the action up a bit, but after realizing the relative ease in which a room can be cleared, this mechanic simplifies the game to the brink of being tedious.  Even after the onset of initial post-hour-mark boredom, I managed to play for four to five hours, though I could play no longer. Red Steel is a good example of how first person shooters shouldn't be approached on the Wii. Sure, it's fun for a bit, and it's an exciting example of the potential of the Wii, but this game's minor technical problems drown those facts and suppress the will for merrymaking.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"The Good: Improved graphics over the original, some added music, challenging, slick animations, amazing bossfights, added tweaks that removes some frustration, deep and rewarding combat system, female character Rachel is now playable.The Bad: Rachel's missions could have been lengthier and more robust, not all changes are necessarily for the better, some signs of age, missing unlockables, bad and unnecessary use of the Sixasis motion controls, doesn't come at a reduced price.To quickly sum up the story of this game you play as master ninja Ryu Hayabusa on a quest for revenge after an evil blade has been stolen from your precious home village along with witnessing some of your fellow clan members being slain or burned alive. During your quest you will not only face ninjas, but also military soldiers and even things not so human such as demons and dragons. That's pretty much all you need to know and the story is both told using CGI and cutscenes using the in-game engine. Before the CGI helped to present the story rather well and they still do. The problem is that they have not have not been remastered to fit with the higher resolution this game is rendered at, so there are times when the in-game stuff actually looks better than the CGI and in the original it was the complete opposite.The gameplay remains pretty much the same which certainly isn't a bad thing as there wasn't much room for improvement to begin with. There is one unnecessary addition though where you have to shake the sixasis controller to increase the power of your ninja magic attack, it feels bizarre and rarely works. The combat in this game requires split-second timing and button mashing won't get you very far. Yes if you haven't heard this is a challenging game that requires a lot of investment and skill to succeed even though it's very easy to learn the basics. The original was almost too hard for some, the very first level for example was actually on the hardest levels in the game and the same holds true here unfortunately but there have been some minor tweaks made to make things a little easier. For example the save points are now a bit more evenly spread out. The bow which you will get to wield later on can now be fired in mid-air which will prove very useful in some of the later chapters. Some frustrating puzzles have been remade or completely removed. A few of the puzzles I really liked though as they provided a nice change of pace and are now in this game often replaced by another combat section or maybe even a new bossfight. While the combat and the bossfights are some of the major highlights of Ninja Gaiden you need a brake from that too once in a while. Too take the focus back on the difficulty again the easier mode called Ninja Dog which was added in Ninja Gaiden Black for the Xbox is here as well but you need to die multiple times early on to unlock it and if you choose to play on the easy mode you will be forced to wear a feminine pink ribbon accessory through the rest of the game. The added weapon called Dragon's Claw & Tiger's Fang which are dual katanas also removes some difficulty because that weapon encourages you too stay on the offensive more even though that weapon doesn't have all too many moves for you to experiment with. You can also now run on water much more easily by simply walking out on the surface and keep moving, many who played the original didn't even know you could run on water.The original game for the Xbox was one of the very best looking games of it's generation and this version looks even better. Especially the lightning which makes everything look a bit more dynamic and realistic but there also tends to be some overuse of bloom effects once in a while. Most of the textures have been improved aswell, the animations are slicker than ever and blood that has been spilt will now stay on the ground and walls. The graphics tend to be uneven though and you can tell that this game wasn't built for the Playstation 3 from the ground up as you will run into some very blury textures once in a while and some edges tends to look very jagged. There are even cases where the game can actually look worse as there are some effects missing such as reflections, god rays from the sun and after-images from Ryu after very fast movement and the water surfaces can even look downright horrible. There are also some performance issues where the game might load when you open an items chest or even during in the middle of a fight which didn't happen in the original but at least the levels themselves loads faster, and yes these issues are still there after the optional installation you can do but thankfully this is something that happens very rarely.Don't get me wrong though the game looks great but considering how much powerful the Playstation 3 is compared the Xbox I expected a little bit more from Team Ninja.The sound and sound effects are pretty much the same and that isn't a bad thing as the sound was very good to begin with. There has been some additional musical scores added though which is much appreciated.As far as value goes the game is highly replayable, especially if you bump up the difficulty as that will change many of your encounters during the story mode. There is also a Mission Mode unlocked after you beat the game but be warned though, these missions can be pretty tough. There are also some new bossfights here not found in the original and Rachel has some missions in Mission Mode too.For fans that have already played trough the original the most interesting addition is probably that you can now play as female character Rachel aside from the few new boss encounters and missions. She plays great but also a lot different from Ryu as she is a bit slower but often deals out more damage. The problem is here though is that her missions tends to be very short and not really too well structured. And while her campaign adds a different perspective of the story that is appreciated some other parts of the story has gone missing as for example the introduction sequence telling the story about the Dragon Sword and the Dark Dragon Blade. There is a sequence that is still there but can be totally missed as that level has been restructured so that you might progress a bit to fast which leads to that a certain upgrade that Ryu gets towards the end of the game might just seem totally random.There are also some unlockables missing such as some costumes and the classic Ninja Gaiden NES titles or the Arcade game are nowhere to be found. The Theatre mode is missing aswell.What hurts the value the most is that they expect you to pay full price for this game which would have been ok if the game would have been more different and packed in some more features but then again Ninja Gaiden Black that contained a fair amount of new content was sold for just 30 dollars when it was released back in 2005.To sum it all up, even though this is originally a game from 2004 and not all changes are for the better this game holds up surprisingly well and is a must buy for anyone that has yet to experience this adventure or are just looking for a challenging action game in general. Old fans should give this a look too as there is some nice extra additions the be found here, but I would advice you if you're one of those to wait for the price to drop a little first.//ZimpanX\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Activision released their fourth installment to the Call Of Duty games, titled Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. The game was very in-depth, with a high amount of detail put into every aspect of the game. From popping car\\'s tires, to shooting through materials such as wood and sheet metal, this game is the closest thing yet to actually being in service.Unlike the other Call Of Duty games, this title takes place in present day, with all of the current weapons and tactics used now. The gameplay is very similar to the other Call Of Duty titles; It\\'s very smooth and seems natural when you shoot. A new addition to the game is bullet penetration. As mentioned before, now, instead of hiding behind a thin sheet of plywood and coming out unharmed, opponents can now fire their weapons through the obstacle. Don\\'t worry though, you can still easily find places to get cover, just watch what you consider \"cover\". The graphics are average of a next-gen game. I was running my settings maxed out at a resolution of 1600x1200 and it ran with an average of 31 frames per second.The story mode is short (I finished it in one night on a difficulty of recruit) but there are four levels of difficulty, so, take your time. In the story, you are switching between S.A.S. missions and tasks from the U.S. Marine Corps. The story is well written; it is a lot like an episode of 24. Like the HALO series, Activision added enemy Intel, a lot like the skulls that we\\'ve spent ever so much time trying to find…There is also online play, with many things that make it different from other games of its kind. For one, the maps are huge and realistic, and span from the bombed streets of the Middle East, to small, overgrown farming villages of Russia. Along with massive selections of weapons and maps, Call of Duty 4 also offers a new option of Create a Class, where you customize your weapons and attachments that fit your needs. Along with create a class, even more customizable options are included, called perks. For example, when killed, a perk is that you drop a live grenade, that (hopefully) blows you opponent to smithereens. There are three slots for you to put perks, and each slot has several choices. The ranking system is a lot like Rainbow 6: Vegas. Wherein every kill (or assist) gives you a certain amount of points, witch brings your overall ranking up. The higher the rank, the more weapons, perks, and attachments you unlock.\\xa0Overall, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is very different from its successors, with an in depth storyline and full customization of your character.',\n",

He agree's to help Mario out, but of course Yoshi has his own motives up his sleeve. Not only has Bowser gone and kidnapped Peach, he has also captured Yoshi's friends and thrown them in some dark castles! So in return of letting Mario use Yoshi's abilities, he has to save the lovely dinosaurs friends! Fair enough.  Now lets talk about the gameplay first of all. Super Mario World feels so right, it is definitly one of the smoothest platformers ever! Of course there's an extra feature in this Mario game, absent in all others up to this point, Yoshi. He really adds an extra dimension to the gameplay and doesn't take much getting used to at all, as he is quite similar to Mario, but still feels refreshingly different.  Yoshi is practicly invincible. If you get hit while riding him, he'll throw you off and make a runner. But you can jump back onto him so long as he doesn't run too far off or fall down a hole. Other than this, Yoshi has a series of abilities such as being able to launch out his very large red tongue at any time, if it hits an enemy or edible object, (for example an apple) Yoshi will eat it. Simple.  Items like apples are automatically swallowed and you receive points, however for enemies a new element is opened up. If you eat a Koopa with a shell, the colour of the shell decides your ability, for example snap up a red shell and you can shoot fire! Other colours allow you to fly for a short period of time and even shoot the shell back out to smash other enemies.  But there's more! Yoshi can jump on stronger enemies and damage them, even on the ones Mario can't handle!  Yoshi is so valuable that he acts like a saviour on top of the usual 'get hit as Super Mario become normal Mario' type health system. But other than Yoshi, there are small, minor things that make the game work better. Such as being able to take control of the camera and making it scroll left or right. So if you miss something, or feel like looking for goodies, it's far easier now. More little things like being able to jump off Yoshi is mid-air, gives you more control over the character.  As for the graphics, they're what you'd expect. Nice and simple, colourful with nothing too distracting .The animation all runs nice and smoothly, and even if it seems like Super Mario World was designed for kids, you'll love this game no matter what age you are. The whole feel of the game is affected by the graphics, which means it all feels very relaxed; it's definitely a pick up and play game. Of course you can get nice and involved. For example finding all the exits on the map will take a fair bit of skill, time and effort, but otherwise it's just a nice laid-back game, which can be slipped in and out of with ease, in the knowledge that you'll enjoy every moment of it when you do.  As you're aware, Super Mario World is set on an overworld map. Everytime you complete a level you get to move onto the next one , until you've uncovered the path to get all the way over to Bowser's castle. Of course it isn't quite that simple. Many of the levels have 'secret exits' which require you to do various things in the level to discover. For example Ghost houses often hide a secret exit somewhere inside that just needs to be found like a normal, but other levels may require you to find a key then an exit. This adds another layer to the game, finding all the exits in the game it's quite a tough little challenge, one that you will be rewarded for as well…  Super Mario World really is one of the greatest Mario games out there, you'll have a blast playing this and building a strong bond between you and Yoshi. And yes, it really does live up to the likes of Super Mario Bros.3.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Everyone has talked about Gears of War\\'s jaw-dropping graphics. If you haven\\'t seen them yet, you\\'re missing out on an incredible achievement in art and technology. The post-apocalyptic landscapes and the ash-shaded, world-weary faces of the characters are better than realistic - they exist in the hyper-reality of imagination. The soundtrack is operatic, tightening the drama and tension of the plot, which, while it could have fleshed out the characters with more detail or provided more back story on the invaders, is still interesting and relevant. The seamless integration of action and narrative is a rare accomplishment and I love that while playing Gears, I never feel like the exposition is tacked on to move me from one point to another like a puppet on a string. The gameplay is tight. Seriously. The controls are intuitive, precise and near-flawless in their application. After a few minutes of mucking about in the training area, you\\'ll stop thinking about them altogether and that\\'s the highest compliment I\\'ve got. When the mechanics of the game fade to transparent as you experience your way through the game, then someone behind the keyboard was really, really good at her job.  But all of this has been said before, by the near-3,000 gamers who have posted reviews, so all I have to add is my own experience. Here it is:  I bought this game for my partner for the anniversary of our first date. It was supposed to be a way for him to blow off some steam at the end of a long day. He booted it up and I turned on my reading light and opened to my bookmarked page. But about 10 minutes later, all thoughts of my book were forgotten. Gears of War is fascinating.  From the moment you break out of prison, you\\'re on the move. Each chapter presents you with a slightly different problem, and each solution is a slightly different variation on the theme of \"find the right weapon - blast bad guy to bits.\" It seems pretty boilerplate. But it isn\\'t . Thanks to it\\'s mind-blowing graphics, soundtrack, storyline and gameplay, Gears turns out to be anything but run-of-the mill.  I play with my partner and I think that\\'s where Gears really shines. This game was made to play cooperatively, with people across the couch and people across the country. In a rare blend of reality and escapism, I find the truncated, action-fare dialogue both amusing and appropriate. Soon you\\'ll be high-five-ing over the coffee table and mimicking the grunts and jeers of your AI teammates as you blast away at a wide variety of armed-to-the-teeth aliens. If one gets too close, just fire up your chainsaw, but be prepared to find yourself soaked in bug guts. This game is bloody, gory and really messy. And it\\'s seriously fun.  Gears has a few oddities. Joining and exiting a cooperative game is a little bumpy. It seems odd to have only one active save per gamer - we\\'re used to having his save, my save and our save - so it\\'s a little but of adjustment. I do think the narrative misses some opportunities to develop the characters and the enemy. All in all, I find myself reaching to come up with something to criticize. So, I\\'ll just stop here and say: you\\'ve got to play it. Go. Now. Play it now.',\n",

       "  'description': \"First, I'll have to admit that i haven't completed a previous GTA game since it was 2d and birds eye view (GTA London).\\xa0 it may have been because, when it went 3d, i never found the story or characters engaging enough and ended up just using loads of cheats and killing as many coppers as i could, but GTA IV has changed that.GTA IV has a believable story line with incredible characters, with excellent voice acting and script which kept me engaged throughout with its plot twists etc. Also, some of the activities you can do on the side are enjoyable, like gettin p*ssed and trying to drive yor friends home again but bowling, darts and pool are allright to play once but i never played them again afterwards. I have to say that the graphics are an improvement from earlier games, but they aren't revolutionary and i wasn't blown away by them. Gameplay is excellent, i like that they have added a cover mechanic and that when you befriend someone you get bonuses like a free taxi, or some guys to give you backup in a firefight which is always helpful.To sum up, graphics were a good enough improvement, but this game is about more of an engaging plot and improved gameplay than visuals.\",\n",

       " {'deck': \"A racing sim that's accessible for anyone? Surely not...\",\n",
       "  'description': \"For years, Gran Turismo has been the seminal racing simulation; the game that all racing sims try to be like, and the game that they are all subsequently judged against. The simple formula of buy car, race car, win money, buy better car has been done to death since the original Gran Turismo hit stores in 1998, and apart from perhaps Microsoft's Forza series, nobody has yet managed to do it better. Nonetheless, as refined as the formula has become, nobody can argue against the fact that it has started to get a little tired.  TOCA Race Driver 3, the third instalment in the popular Codemasters series, offers a very different style of racing simulation. Rather than opting for the style popularised by GT and its cousins, TRD3 instead decides to throw everything it's got at you. You won't find any licence tests, credits or prize cars here. The game throws you straight into the thick of it, slugging a DTM touring car round a twisting course. Then, before you know it, you're behind the wheel of a Renault Clio, or a Formula Ford.  This is the appeal of TRD3; the sheer variety on offer. There are two main modes to choose from, World Tour and Pro Career. Both will have you changing vehicles at pretty regular intervals, bringing over 30 different kinds of motorsport to your fingertips. Although this might sound like a metaphorical car crash waiting to happen, the game pulls it off incredibly well. All the cars feel pretty distinctive, and while you'll certainly notice the difference between a cumbersome supertruck and a zippy Formula BMW, you'll also appreciate the subtle differences within each of the game's 6 major disciplines.  None of this would matter if the racing wasn't up to anything, and thankfully it is. In each race, you'll be up against several other vehicles (up to 20 in some cases), all governed by more than competent AI. This is the area where TRD3 delivers the GT series a kick in the teeth. Having 20 cars screeching round a track, all behaving in ways you'd expect, is a huge step forward from flitting past five clumsily-driven vehicles. It also means you have to fight for every place, making races tough but rewarding.  Car control is sharp, and as mentioned you'll have to adjust your style depending on the vehicle you're driving. The default control system is a two analog stick affair, with the left controlling the car's steering and the right in charge of acceleration and braking. If this doesn't suit you, the game's control system can be completely customised. I personally found it easier to switch the car's throttle and brake to the shoulder buttons, but it's all a matter of preference.  The other aspect of racing present in TRD3 that isn't in GT is the inclusion of a largely impressive damage model. This means that richocheting between cars is not an option. You'll have to drive instinctively and sensibly to make any progress. Collisions result in all kinds of damage. A dent in the bodywork will affect the car's aerodynamics, slowing it down slightly. Suspension damage means your motor will be a bit lairy in the corners. A head-on crash into a wall will often take out a tyre, or possibly even a whole wheel. Overall, it's well implemented, and certainly better than Forza's half-hearted attempt.  As previously mentioned, TRD3 has two primary career modes, and you'll find all the features listed above present and correct. On top of this, there's a nice multiplayer mode and online support included. Getting online and finding a race is easy enough, and as long as you stick to the developer's advice and keep racers down to about 6 per room, lag is somewhere between minimal and non-existent. However, there does seem to be a clear dislike online of players without a USB headset. Without one of these, expect to be kicked out of a few rooms.  Graphically, TRD3 doesn't disappoint. All the cars are gorgeous, although the polygon count is nowhere near that of GT. Races hold up perfectly with no drops in frame rate, even with 20 cars on the track. The tracks themselves are convincing, faithful representations of their real life counterparts. There are also some nice touches, like being able to see the gunk collecting on tyres when you veer off onto the infield. The only real graphical problem is some of the damage. Open-wheelers aside, cars never really crumple realistically, and a lot of the major cosmetic damage just looks daft.  Sound is by and large impressive, with the cars themselves being stars of the show. Engines all sound authentic and unique to their respective cars, and tire screeches and crashes all sound pretty realistic too. The voice acting is surprisingly solid, with your Scottish manager sounding appropriately ecstatic, smug, worried or annoyed, depending on the situation. It's also nice to have his input mid-race, adding a little more authenticity to an already impressive package. The menu music is alright, but never really impressive at any point. GT veterans will also notice the lack of music in races, although in fairness it probably would have been out of place. Nonetheless, a few licensed tracks for the menu would have been a nice addition.  Overall, TOCA Race Driver 3 is a very impressive racing sim. It's instantly accessible, but contains a lot of depth for those willing to persevere. It's certainly not perfect. The damage engine, great as it is, could still use some improvement. The graphics are nowhere near in the same league as Gran Turismo, nor does it offer the near bottomless depth of its main rival. It has less tuning options and less cars. It's not quite a GT beater yet, but the arrival of the PS3 could change all that. With the king of racers stuck in a rut, TOCA could well overtake it at the next corner. We'll just have to wait and see.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Well, I was skeptic when I heard that the next Commandos game was going to be a FPS. I thought they had blown it. And when I saw the GS score, I almost cried a little. So now that Steam had a packaged bundle. All the Commandos games for only $49,99 I thought what the hey.  So, first thing\\'s first: Gameplay this is why you would have to have played the original Commandos games to really understand what’s going on. \"What the hell, if I crouch here those guys standing  away won’t see me?\" This is unusual in FPS like games. And for some, might be ridiculous. But this is why it’s like this. This game, is still very much a Commandos game, its only changed perspectives from over-head too out-from-head (first person) The game keeps allot of aspects of the 2-d games, and quite frankly. When you know this, it makes sense. And it allows for very fun, and intuitive sneak gameplay. Some thing else that is great about this game is the fact that you can change the guy you are using. There are three types of characters in the game. The Sniper, The Spy and The Green Beret (gunner). And it’s pretty easy to understand what each one is about. So let me set up a scenario for you. You need to get you\\'re sniper into a tower, but the way is blocked by a German solider. Then switch to you\\'re spy. Change into German uniform, walk up to him, walk behind him and wire his throat shut. Then the Sniper can get into position to clear the way for the Green Beret. Its fun, it’s a challenge and its puzzle. The shooting is fun and responsive, and the Axis has a satisfying rag doll effect.  Graphics: Well, it’s not Battlefield 2 ore GRAW. But the textures are crisp and clean for the most part. The models could use a couple of extra polygons; especially in the face (nose and cheeks are a bit pointy). But it’s pleasant to look at. And it will run on pretty much anything. The particle effects are good looking and well done. And as I mentioned before, rag doll effects are always good. But they are terrific in this game. The landscape looks very nice, Stalingrad looks like a war torn city,  looks like  (I should know, I live there) And France looks like . In the end, that\\'s what’s most important. That they\\'ve managed to sell the scenario too me, the gamer.  Sound: Its good, and its orchestral. It’s not some computer program. The weapons sounds good and powerful. The speech is good, but quite frankly the sounds are just good. Nothing that will really catch you off guard and show you what it can do (no CoD effect). But its there and doing the job it’s supposed to.  In the end, it’s a great game. The concerns people had with lacking story is foolish. It’s a Commandos game, and it’s a WW2 game. When did those two ever have a story? If you like stealth games, you will like this. If you like Commandos games, you will like this. If you like both, you will love this game. I know I do.',\n",

       "  'description': \"It’s widely accepted that the PlayStation’s Final Fantasy VII is the best game in Square Enix’s long-running RPG series. With its memorable characters, labyrinthine plot and superb RPG gameplay, it’s a game that many fans wish would be remade for current generation consoles. While there’s no guarantee that such a remake is on the way, the Japanese developers have been keeping fans of the game happy with a series of spin-off titles. We’ve been treated to a movie sequel, subtitled Advent Children, the upcoming PSP prequel Crisis Core and even a tantalising PS3 tech demo mirroring the opening moments of the original game.  The latest family member to hit stores in the UK is Dirge Of Cerberus, a semi-sequel chronologically positioned between Advent Children and the original game. This instalment focuses on recluse Vincent Valentine, one of the most loved but least understood characters of FFVII. The storyline has two strands, focusing on current events and occasionally flashing back to Vincent’s past. Most fans will inevitably pick the game up just to get Vincent’s side of the story, so I shan’t spoil things here. Rest assured it’s exactly what you’d expect from the professional at Square Enix. The gameplay, however, is a completely different story.  Fans expecting a typical Square Enix RPG might be disappointed. Put simply, Dirge Of Cerberus is a third-person shooter. FPS gamers will instantly feel right at home with the game’s dual analog movement control and guns assigned to the shoulder buttons. An auto-lock on feature and the ability to switch weapons at the touch of a button are also present. For the most part, this system works very well. The controls are intuitive and offer a great deal of freedom, although fans of third person action adventure games like Prince Of Persia may take some time to break instinct and feel comfortable with the FPS-style controls. The camera is certainly functional and doesn’t feel too awkward, although it does have a tendency to fail you in battles against some of the larger bosses. On the whole though, Dirge Of Cerberus controls smoothly.  The mechanics are pretty good too, and this is where the RPG elements begin to make themselves known. The three guns on offer don’t feel too different from each other to use, but one will be a better choice than the others depending on your situation. Enemies feel pretty generic too, but they offer a decent challenge, and the boss battles have their moments as well. Of course, you’d expect this from any half-decent shooter, but beneath the surface are a number of features you’d only expect from Square Enix. A familiar RPG-style menu is available at the touch of a button. Items and Materia are available for use in battle. Weapons can be customised to increase their magazine capacity, rate of fire and damage potential. Vincent can level up, increasing various parameters that subsequently affect his strength, resilience and speed. There are even damage points that appear on screen after every successful shot. At its heart, Dirge Of Cerberus hasn’t departed too much from the genre that spawned it.  Aesthetically, Dirge Of Cerberus is gorgeous. The production levels are exactly what we’ve come to expect. The graphics are wonderful, merging detailed character models with gritty 3D backdrops that remain true to its source material. Of particular note is the Shinra Mansion level, which perfectly recreates the familiar environment from the game. This fidelity will no doubt appeal to nostalgic FFVII fans. The aforementioned character models are impressive, too. Although nowhere near as detailed as those from FFX and FFXII, they suit the mood well and stay true to the style of FFVII. Vincent is clearly a labour of love, and the expected cameos that feature all look great too. Less time seems to have been spent on the new characters, and some of them seem a little out of place in the FFVII universe, but they’re still very appealing to the eye. The highlights, as always, are the FMV sequences, which look as though they’ve been torn straight out of the Advent Children movie.  The sound is also very good, and does a great job of rounding off the presentation. The music is well-composed and appropriate. Fans will no doubt recognise some of the tunes, but there’s some original material in there too. The voice acting is strong, with the actors making great work of an at-times clichéd script. Steve Blum shines as the lead role, and most members of the Advent Children cast reprise their roles for their cameo appearances. Sound effects are at an acceptable level, although none of the guns really sound as powerful as they should. As an example, the Cerberus pistol has three barrels, but doesn’t really have much bark (no pun intended).  Some naff gunshot sounds aren’t Dirge Of Cerberus’ only problem. Although it executes the third person shooter pretty well, that is essentially all it does. The RPG elements don’t have too much impact on gameplay, and the sometimes repetitive nature of the game can make it feel very generic. Put simply, it lacks any real kind of innovation. Lifespan is also an issue. Coming in at around ten to fifteen hours, with little real challenge, the main story feels a little short. A few more intricate puzzles wouldn't have gone a miss here. Fans of FFVII will play it through more than once, but more so for the storyline than anything else. There are some bonus missions on offer, but the generic gameplay means even they offer little incentive to dive back into the game.  Dirge Of Cerberus isn’t FFVII meets Devil May Cry, but fans wouldn’t have been expecting it. As a standalone game, it’s a fair shooter that’s worth a rental. For fans of the series, it’s definitely worth adding to your collection, as it’s the fans who’ll get most out of it. Granted, it could have been better. But it could have been a lot worse, too. Dirge Of Cerberus may not do everything brilliantly, but it does a lot of things right, and that’s what makes it definitely worth a play, fan or not.\",\n",

       " {'deck': '\"Bad Company\" Sets a New Standard',\n",
       "  'description': 'Battlefield: Bad Company sets a new standard, in my opinion. Not only does this game bring a highly enjoyable single player experience, but it also has an addicting multi-player game. Bad Company was announced back in 2006 and made by Electronic Arts. This highly anticipated game was well worth the wait, and you\\'re about to find out why. Bad Company is also the first Battlefield game to be exclusive to consoles. Previous games have been brought to consoles from the PC. This game feels like it was meant for a console, which is good for both Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 owners who have this game.StoryYou are Preston Marlowe. You are a part of a the B-Company, filled with all the \"losers\" that were sent to war instead of thrown in jail. Your squad includes Haggard, Sweet Water and sergeant Redford. You may develop some feelings towards each character as you go through out the game because they each have unique personalities you will probably never forget. You\\'re sent to a fictional war in Russia. The army doesn\\'t really care about your squad, you\\'re just sent in so they don\\'t have to waste their highly valued troops. After some time in the game you begin to find boxes of gold. This leads you and your squad on a journey to find a whole lot of gold, and get yourselves into a whole lot of trouble. Throughout the journey you will get a few laughs from jokes that are actually funny from your squad members. This alone ads depth to the story by showing personality to characters. Sure your in the middle of war, but these jokes are just plain funny. It could take away from the reality of war, but overall i think the jokes are funny and help develop personalities of characters. It\\'s really something you never see in a game, especially a first person shooter. The story definitely isn\\'t as deep as a game like Bioshock or Mass Effect, but for a shooter it is very well written and enjoyable.SoundThe sound in this game is probably the most realistic war sounding game out there. From rocket launchers, to hand guns, vehicles, or your assault rifle, everything sounds realistic and embraces you even deeper into the game. If you have surround sound i really can\\'t imagine how it would be. This is one of the few games that actually makes me feel like this is real and im there. Battlefield: Bad Company sets a new standard in the sound department and should encourage future games to develop more embracing sound effects.Graphics:The graphics are pretty good, but they aren\\'t the best. You may notice a small film grain. Explosions are done very well, as well as buildings being destroyed. With tons of different environments the colors are pretty to look at, especially the sunsets and rivers. I\\'m sure you will be happy with the graphics if you play this game because they are good and the Gameplay really doesn\\'t make you think about graphics. If i had to rate the graphics out of ten i would probably give them an eight. If we had never seen games such as gears of war or call of duty 4 you would probably think the graphics were amazing.GameplayThe best part of bad company. You have tons of weapons and vehicles to choose from. Vehicles include: helicopter, tank, truck, mini tank, boat, and a few others. Most first person shooters are narrow and make you follow a certain path. In Bad Company, you choose your way to get to your destination. There is also a large map you can explore if you want to try and find more gold crates. If you can\\'t find an open door, equip your grenade launcher and just blow your way through a building. There are tons of gas barrels and flamable things to blow up near buildings, which encourages you to blow even more stuff up, which is really fun to watch and hear. The explosions are amazing. They seem realistic and not just certain parts destroy on every building. Any part of a building can be destroyed except for the framework. Every gun also feels unique and you will acquire new guns throughout the game and get achievements for acquiring so many. If you die in game, you automatically respawn from not to far away, and any damage you have done, or enemies you have killed are still dead. This may be a bad thing to some people but brings some relief to me, especially since there are some tough moments in the game. AI is also very intelligent for most of the game, as they will hide behind objects and try to avoid your fire, but some do stand out in the open which is fine for me because i can get an easy shot off. You also will have several different gadgets. These can include rocket launchers, air strike attack, drill to repair vehicles, and a few more.MultiplayerThis is where all previous games have shined. Bad Company shines here as well. There are five classes to play with online. A few of these include: Assault, Recon, Support, and specialist. When you get tired of one you can always change it up which adds more replay ability. There is only one online mode to play but there are future plans to release downloadable content which will add another online mode to play. Currently the online mode, you are either an attacker or defender. Defenders have to defend their gold crates while attackers try to destroy them. There is also a rank up system like in Call of Duty 4, which encourages you to play more to increase your rank to unlock different types of gadgets and guns. This game is nothing like Call of Duty however. In call of duty 3 they brought vehicles, which in my opinion was a disaster. In Call of Duty 4 they took away vehicles and you had a solid shooter. In Bad Company, they have vehicles and the game is still a solid shooter online. Everything seems balanced. Also one shot will not kill you in battlefield. You need to have a strategy in this game. In my opinion, this is a good change, its not your ordinary run and gun game.OverallBattlefield: Bad Company is a really great game that successfully pulls off both multiplayer and single player very well. I gave this game a 10/10 because i really enjoyed it. No the game is not perfect, but it is something that you will want to keep in your game library, and probably play for quite some time. Any fans of previous games will like this, as well as new comers. I would suggest this to any fan of first person shooters and especially to those who like driving vehicles in games. So definitely buy this game if you like any of the following: explosions, vehicles, large weapon choice, first person shooter, fun online, interesting and funny story, true next gen sound. Hopefully this review has helped you decide whether or not Battlefield: Bad Company is right for you.Note - This review was first written on gamespot, by me (Poker360).',\n",

       "  'description': 'when i got this game at christmas it was the only thing i played for the next week. anyway on to the game the game is supposed to be a souped up version of advanced wars but instead it got turned into a 3rd person shooter which im a big fan of. the gameplay is like any other 3rd person shooter what i mean by that is that you have to hold down the l-shoulder button to lock on to an enemy. but the other controls are very different such as using the A button to fire your weapon the B button to jump the c-stick to cycle through your troops. the gameplay is fun and can be pretty hard at times. like once i did not play this game for an entire month because of how pissed i was at the level i was on. the troops have are also pretty cool such as riflemen,flamethrower,bazooka.missle vets,assault,and grenade launchers. the vehicles are also pretty cool like the light tank, heavy tank,battlestation, light recon, heavy recon,gunships(helicopters), bombers, fighter jets, and the best aircraft the strato destroyer with bombs and missles this aircraft you only get it on 1 or 2 missions. the fact that there is no multiplayer makes this game kinda diapointing without multiplayer. this game would have much more replay ability than it already has. to be honest i havent beaten the game but im on the last mission so hopefuly i beat it soon.if you have a gc and like 3rd person shooters get it.

       "  'description': 'Argue all you like, but adventure games are alive and well in their present state. Even though there’s hardly room for growth, developers appear to be making adequate reparations in order to market their products. This may not be the ’Lucas Arts’ vision of success, but there are plenty that are carrying the torch proud:\\xa0 Funcom, Quantic Dream, even Capcom have secured respectable Metacritic standards for the anthropomorphic ‘Zack and Wiki’. I suppose we’ll be working with Quantic Dream’s vision for growth today- as their million dollar baby, Fahrenheit, made it onto Xbox Live Originals earlier last year.Fahrenheit’s repertoire is a work on the commonly applicable doomsday predictions, and pits regular Average Joe ‘Lucas Kane’ in quite the predicament: In an East Side diner bathroom, he has brutally murdered a bystander without even being consciously aware he did it. The game enables you to control two detectives investigating the murder ‘Carla Valenti’ and ‘Tyler Miles’, in addition to Lucas himself- With the interface composed of a scheme similar to the ‘FREE’ system utilised in ‘Shenmue’; actions can be carried out by moving the analogue stick in a mannerism similar to their on screen representation. While some features, such as dialogue trees, do not use this method- the majority of the content, even combat, uses this technique. But I suppose this is where one of Fahrenheit’s follies arise, the controls feel too rigid- you’ll find yourself walking into walls often, and this doesn’t help when some actions require precise timing.Fahrenheit dubs itself an ‘Interactive Cinematic Experience’, and for the most part, I believe it seeing as the Gameplay feels indiscriminately shallow- but even so, that’s not to say that Quantic Dream have been remiss from any standpoint. The story deals with a number of drastically different themes, like: Science Fiction, Mystery and Horror- all are executed\\xa0 remarkably well. Infact, early on in the game, you’ll find yourself deeply sympathising for each character’s wellbeing due to their charisma. Leading me to another point of praise: the voice acting is remarkable.A feature that differentiates itself from the majority of the commercial adventure games on the market these days, is the inclusion of a ‘Sanity Meter’. The character being controlled will deal with a number of events, and this will be met with a positive or negative effect on their disposition- forcing them to deal with a number of emotions, such as: Depression, anxiety and tenseness. If not monitored appropriately, this could possibly drive your character to the point of suicide, or in the Tyler or Carla’s case giving up on the case altogether. The Sanity Meter, and your character’s actions, can potentially differentiate the story ark in future episodic instalments within the game. An example of this comes to fruition from the beginning, how Lucas deals with covering his tracks from the crime. Depending on the outcome, this will lead the authorities to believe whether he is either a lunatic or a cold premeditated murderer.Perhaps the most enticing thing about Fahrenheit, bar none, is its wonderfully coherent presentation. Seeing as Quantic Dream have access to the motion capture technology ‘Immortal (Ad Vitam)’, the character’s animations are remarkably fluid; a similar technology was used in their, less popular, previous title ‘Omikron: Nomad Soul’. But from a design standpoint, the majority of the skyline bares a striking resemblance to their real New York counterparts- even the fictitious areas still are remarkably life like.I don’t quite know how to summarise Fahrenheit without conforming to it’s glowing qualities, and not forgoing it’s shortcomings in the process- but suffice it to say,\\xa0 £10/$20 is immeasurable value for this Interactive Cinematic Experience. Fahrenheit does little to follow it’s predecessor’s gameplay mechanics, removing all intended combat entirely, utilising the aforementioned FREE system. But you can’t begrudge it on that accord, considering the experience itself has proven deeply immersive. If you’ve never experienced Fahrenheit, I’d strongly recommend an Xbox Live Originals purchase; the emulation stays true to the source material.',\n",

       "  'description': 'While some say Halo Combat evolved is better than Halo 2 They are both great in their own way. While halo 2 has better multiplayer and Halo CE has a hell of a good campaign. Im going to start with single player first so here goes nothing.The games campaign starts you out almost the excact same way in Halo ce meaning that you start out at your base which makes the game feel like its repeating its self which is good and bad.So anyway in halo ce you learn about \"Halo\" And in Halo 2 you learn that the Covenant is going to use it as weapon To destroy Something (I never really payed attention to the plot) So you have to try and stop the prophets of Halo from destroying whatever it is they are going to destroy.And yes the Campaign is not as good as Halo CE it still is not as bad as everybody says but its just my opinion. The Story can get confusing at times as to what the heck is going on but its still fun to play as the covenant sometimes even though playing as two different armys in the campaign is not as much fun as playing just Master chief. Also when you are the covenant you are fighting against your fellow aliens sometimes since you play as arbiter who after figuring out the prophets were going to Destroy something with \"halo\" arbiter rebels against the covenant and tries to figure out what is going on.Anyway to sum up the campaign No its not as good As Halo CeBut its till a heck of lot of Fun to play by your self or with a friend in co-op even though the story is confusing a times the campaign is not as bad as everone says and its not as good as Halo Ce.Now to the mutliplayer.The multiplayer is no doubt the star of the game With the option to play Split screen or online With LIVE Either way its fun.There are quite a few maps (around 15 I think) and game modes to choose from (Also around 15 if look at all the Extra ones like slayer swords Which is slayer game mode but you can just use the Halo sword).But If you are playing split screen (up to 4 players can play split screen) then i would just suggest slayer game mode Since the other game modes on split screen prove to not be as good as they are on LIVE Plainly because of screen lookers on splitscreen.You can customize Your character for Multiplayer From the color (which you could do in halo ce Multiplayer) But this time you can choose a secondary color to separate you from the rest of the player On LIVE, you also can customize a flag with the option of your symbol and colors To also help separate you from the rest of the players.And to sum up the multiplayer it is better than halo ce multiplayer But mainly because of LIVE and the maps are Kick @$$ Maps but still in my opinion the mutliplayer overall in halo 2 is better than Halo Ce mutliplayer.In Halo 2 everybody got pissed that the Assault rifle from The first halo was taken out and replaced by the battle rifle while its not as good as the assault rifle its burst fire and scope make it a very good weapon in any situation. In addition to the battle rifle comeing to halo 2 some other weapons make a First appearance such as The Smg which is a small pistol like weapon with automatic fire and can be dual wielded (most other small weapons can be dual wielded) another new weapon is the carbine which is a covenant rifle weapon that is pretty powerful and has a scope like the battle rifle.The games sound is just as good if not better than Halo Ce\\'s Sound, from the music to the sound of explosions makes it seem very realistic and add the tension to the game.The games graphics are no doubt better than the first Halo\\'s graphics in halo ce all the textures were kinda sharp and edgy but not in halo 2 making in for a better experience graphics wise. Another good thing about the graphics is that the graphics are awesome and i have never had any lag whatsoever in, not even on LIVE where sometimes there can be big battles.Overall if you have a XBOX then you Need (not want) to get halo 2 in order to appreciate the xbox\\'s Pure power and graphics ability.Multiplayer: 9.9/10Funness factor: 9.5/10Single player: 8.9/10Co-op: 9.7/10Graphics: 10/10Sound: 9.8/10replay value: 9.9/10Gameplay: 10/10Tilt: 9.7/10 ',\n",

Not satisfied by the roster Nintendo launched with the game different modes, Master Pieces being one of them. In the master piece part of the game it will let you try out a few of the games available from Nintendo via the shop, although the master piece add-on is quite a good feature, it seems to appeal only to the die hard Nintendo fan. The WFC (Nintendo Wifi Connection) is not as good as expected. Even when playing locally with friend codes it tends to lag not serious, but it lags not like the ones found on Halo 3 (no hard feelings towards Halo 3, but it\\'s annoying when you are playing lone wolves and all of a sudden bam! serious lag). Another issue appears when attempted  to play with anyone it seems becomes impossible to find a match because the WFC servers are getting more work than they can handle, this is an issue Nintendo has commented on, and is currently working on it. It\\'s getting really hard to find on-line matches without getting a message that says \"you ave been disconnected...\", I hope Nintendo gets more severs up and running.   Apart form that minor issue the game hold up to be very good whether you are playing alone; Classic and The subspace Emissary are bound to keep playing for hours until you unlock every single player, stage, song, trophy... you know what I mean there are tons of stuff to unlock.  On the other hand multiplayer mode, I think this is where the game really shines the most, what beats a couple of your best friends playing an chaotic, fast-paced, mind blowing brawl if you ask me nothing, but that is up to you to judge. I\\'ve never had so much fun beating up Pikachu since Pokemon yellow came out, seriously. All your friends will begging to play over and over again. Whether you are playing with stock, stamina or even coins you\\'ll have fun, you can even challenge your friends in a little tourney to prove who is the best brawler. Nintendo went over the top with this game, but I must warn you if you have played previous versions of smash, brawl may seem as a do over; Wrong!, the game is so good an addictive that I\\'m playing as i write this review, and if your a first timer, be prepared to get hooked on one of the best selling franchises of all time.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Now when I say best shooter ever I mean it, With a hardcore campaign and awesome multiplayer halo has something for everybody.Im going to start with the campaign so here goes nothing.Halo\\'s campaign starts you out in your ship (or base) somewhere in outerspace while the covenant is attacking, Which makes for some pretty exciting and intense action in the first mission while in most other shooters the first mission is slow paced. But thats not the case in halo sure there are sometimes where the action slows down but thats because you just fought in a big hard battle and you deserve a break from kicking Covenant Butt. There are Vehicles in the campaign mode Ranging from the almighty Scorpion tank to the fast yet lethal warthog ( a jeep like vehicle) giving it a even more fun experience in the campaign.There is a story and its pretty basic the story goes as The covenant (your enemies) Are searching for \"Halo\" which is a very big weapon capable of destroying an entire solar system (or more).And the reason they are attacking you is in order to find \"Halo they have to get rid of the humans so that they can do as they please (meaning use \"Halo\" as a weapon to take over the universe or something).There are Quite a few missions in Halo making for about at least 12 or more hours on the easiest difficulty setting. But there is co-op for up to two players meaning more covenant butt kicking for you and a buddy giving it a lot a replay value.There is multiplayer in Halo for up to four players making its already lots of replay value even more. There are lots of game modes in Halo\\'s mutliplayer around 20 (no im not kidding) and about 12 maps, making for lots of different combination\\'s meaning almost endless amounts of gameplay. There are also vehicle sin two of the maps in multiplayer But only warthogs which is rather disappointing since the Pc version can have scorpions and banshee\\'s in the mutliplayer. In the mutliplayer each player can customize his or her color so you can tell each other apart.There are not a lot of weapons in Halo but each one is fun to use none the less. The most common weapon in the campaign is the assault rifle but you can still find other weapons along the way and trade them if you would like. but still from the Human pistol (which is pretty dang powerful even for a pistol) To the rocket launcher each weapon is useful and fun to use.The graphics are pretty amazing For a console game even though it was made in 2001 I still am amazed by the graphics.The sound is simply put \"awesome\" and no other game can even reach the ranks of Halo\\'s sound from the music (which is pretty dang awesome) to the sound of the guns and the shouts of the covenant grunts (They are really funny) So once again no other game will ever reach the ranks of Halo\\'s sound till the end of man (or even E.T.).Im just going to say this very simple No matter who you are, even if you just hate shooters YOU need to get this game.Campaign: 10/10Co-op: 10/10Multiplayer: 9.8/10Gameplay: 10/10Tilt: 10/10Funnessfactor: 10/10Sound: 10/10Graphics: 10/10Replay value: 10/10',\n",

       "  'description': 'It’s when you play games like this that you know you’re in for a real treat. Okami is a beautiful self-shaded Adventure RPG that takes you across vast environments in an unbelievable fictional world. You play as a White wolf by the name of Amaterasu who is the Goddess of the Sun reborn in the form of a wolf. This game features a deceptively long story, that last well over 40 hours of gameplay giving you an ample amount of time to explore the vast world of Nippon. Though a few similarities can be drawn from Okami to the Zelda franchise it still stands out on its own as a completely original game. During your adventures you are a companied by a flea like creature called Issun who basically does all of the talking for you, as you forge through your quest to vanquish evil from the land by regaining your divine powers. This is where a most interesting game mechanic is introduced. The Celestial Brush is basically the core to how you progress through the game and the long battles. Simply activating it with the R1 button turns the screen into a large piece of parchment in which you paint your powers into action; these paintings range from a quick stroke across the screen to mince your enemies to restoring bridges and plant life back to their original state. For the rapid completionist this game can go far beyond the 60 hour mark as there are many side quests and treasures to find everywhere in the world. This game maybe a long one but it is worth every second of action for it delivers a stunning experience from start to finish for both veterans and newcomers to the gaming experience.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Playing this game was one of the earliest memories I have of the NES, which is why I wanted\\xa0 Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II to be the first game i'm going to review.The game starts you off at the bottom of a mountain with no idea what to do and a strange picture of a face blowing wind at the bottom left of the screen, the game is split into 5 sections: A wind level and boss, a water level and boss, an earth level and boss, a fire level and boss and finally the non-elemental top of the mountain last level and last boss which\\xa0 you fight at the peak of the mountain. The graphics in the game look crisp enough for the 8-bit era some excellent boss designs and flashy looking spells make this one of the more polished games for the console. The music in the game leaves a lot to be desired with just 4 meager tracks in the entire game and even those are nothing special and forgettable, you won't find yourself humming the games main theme after you're done.While traversing the game world in Ironsword is fun I was left feeling the game wouldn't have gone amiss with just a few hints or help on where exactly your goal points lie, sometimes a crucial element needed to beat a boss and progress with the game is e.g in a chest behind a fake wall that looks exactly the same as every other wall in the area. Money is a pretty big factor in te game as you are constantly picking up forms of currency be it in jewels money bags etc. this can be spent in the various inns scattered throughout the different levels.While the game can be frustrating at times with taxing and sometimes downright unfair level design  (however this IS a NES platformer we're talking about) it never manages to keep it from being fun. Sure you'll curse up a storm trying to make jumps that seem impossible only to find out later you need a pair of special boots to make it in the first place but it is satisfiying when you finally work these things out and progress.All in all Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II is a decent platformer which tries to do more than it is capable of, while the levels are expansive they lack direction and apart from that fault it is a tight package and I would reccomend this game to any NES platforming afficinado.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Perfection is the only word that comes to mind when Bioshock is mentioned. This game is rich with story, enemies, and environments for you to explore. You start off as some unknown person sitting on a plane, when suddenly it crashes in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Fortunately for you there is an ominous lighthouse not too far away, seeing as how that is your only option for shelter you enter and from then on all hell will break loose. Bioshock is a gripping survival experience that will have you guessing until the very end, as you would expect from a game that has been hyped up for months, Bioshock certainly delivers to all of those expectations and much, much more. You play through the game in the underwater utopia called Rapture, and as you would expect from first impressions not all is the way it should be. Every person that you bump into is either mentally insane or plainly wants to kill you. The levels in the game are fairly large and allow you to explore the area to your heart's content, but still reminds you of where you should be headed thanks to a little goal arrow at the top of the screen. Every enemy in the game has a very sophisticated A.I, and that really forces you to think about what you have to do for everything because ammunition seems to run thin right when you would need it the most. Overall, Bioshock is a very solid game that will keep you coming back for more each time.  Graphics: Among the many things about Bioshock that stand out is its stunning presentation. The city of rapture really immerses you into the experience with an in-your-face, rundown, art deco look, and gives you the feeling that you're right in the middle of the sinking underwater city. The graphics of this game are simply unprecedented, the water effects are virtually photo-realistic, and the dynamic lighting gives the game that very eerie, creepy feel. As you progress through the game, the visuals will keep grabbing you back in as each level deserves its own praise on design and originality. From the underwater fisheries, to the underwater forest, you will be continuously stunned by all the intrinsic detail in the game. Though at some points throughout the game those lovely details weren't loaded up and all that was showing at some points were the pre-rendered models for some of the walls and corpses. Other than those minor glitches the game suffered from no slow-downs even when the on screen action was starting to get really hectic.   Gameplay: The way that the game plays itself is nothing new; however it is in the various ways that all the enemies react to your fighting tactics in the game. The A.I, in Bioshock is definitely a force to be reckoned with, especially with the tougher foes like the Big Daddy. When facing them I often found myself setting all my traps before hand and checking my ammo to make sure that I had the right type of ammo ready to face them. The secondary weapons used in Bioshock are Plasmids, which are the genetic modifications that you inject into your character and he then gains the ability to shoot electricity out of his fingers or turn foes against each other or even force the Big Daddies to help him. The Plasmids are more of a support weapon more than anything because they really help you when you're in a tight situation, should you need to find a quick way to escape your enemies. They come in four different categories: Plasmids, Combat, Engineering, and Physical; where the last three are your passive abilities. There are over 75 different Plasmids and Tonics that are scattered throughout the game and you can use them in many different combinations that range from making you invisible whenever you're not moving, to having security cameras taking much longer to sound the alarm after they spot you. The choices in this game are endless. The Primary weapons are the basic assortment of rifles, shotguns, and BFG's that are standard to any shooter, but what makes these unique is that they will utilize about three different types of ammunition that are useful in certain situations. Each will serve their own purpose; these weapons can also be upgraded to further enhance their firepower, accuracy and range. There really isn't a shortage of things to do when you're playing through this game, it can keep you coming back for more each time.  Sound: The atmospheric sounds and voice work in Bioshock is of AAA quality. Every sound happens when it should and adds just that much more value to the game. The game plays on ambient and distant sounds that will throw off the player's judgment, footsteps and desperately psychotic voices give each foe a certain distinct individuality. If you can remain unseen by an enemy splicer you can hear them either mumbling to themselves about some horrible tragedy that may have taken place in the past, or hear them scheming about something that they want to do. The eerie footsteps of the characters, to the distant sound of water coming trickling through the ceiling; the mixture of each of these sounds will constantly keep you on the edge of you seat. A highly original soundtrack further enhances the atmosphere of the game reminding the player that this game is taking place in the 1960's despite the fact that all of this heavily sophisticated technology in your immediate surroundings. You could be roaming through a dilapidated theater, defending yourself from a pack of tragic psychopaths while having Mama Loves Mambo playing quite poorly in the background. All of these little intricate elements combined together into one package will take for the ride of your life in one of the greatest fictional worlds ever conjured. Overall Bioshock should be at least a game of the year nominee for the sheer vastness of its playability and longevity to come.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Seeing as this is my first review I will probably sound overly critical, its how I am and how I view anything when I first come into it.\\xa0I will throw my personal  opinions in first, the one thing that stresses me during a review is people saying I and me.\\xa0Personal OpinionMy personal first impression of the game was how complete it felt, when you started it didn't feel as if any of the idea's where half done or unpolished and everything worked how you would expect. I was surprised at the change in controls for the first few minutes but as I got used to them I found out how much stronger they where, it certainly gave the game a smooth combat control whilst also feeling as it if hadn't deviated from its predicessors designs.\\xa0Personally I considered the controls and overall polish of the game to be nearly perfect, there isn't any room for improvement single player wise (although multiplayer is another deal all together.) I have been a lover of the length and style of the cutscenes since MGS so the length didn't bother me, I found they flowed extreamly well and never felt too long (but then again if you didn't like them before, you won't now.)GameplayGameplay wise MGS4 can only be compared to the second and third in the series, the cutscenes are just as long if not longer whilst having mostly the same pace and dialoge. If you where not a fan of the previous cutscene lengths and styles you won't find anything different here, although this time around you can press L1 or X at specific times to see through or snakes eyes or get small flashbacks of characters respectively.The first half of the game snake has been put in the middle of a war zone, basically for the first half of the game you are in generally sneaking through crossfire from either side. Without giving too much away, this gives a real sense of danger to the battlefields whilst also making them more interesting than your usual jaunt through barely manned tunnels and underground area's.\\xa0The octo cammo suit you get only proves to be an auto camo index, saving you from menu fumbling to find the perfect cammo. This sytem works surprisngly well, littearly every surface you can press against has its own cammo although you don't perfectly meld with the texture it still looks very impressive. When you get more skilled in the game you can move from cammo to cammo with ease, learning exactually how long to stay still to make the cammo change and keep moving without much of a hold up.PlotNothing much can really be said here, if too much is said (which is easy) it can ruin the entire game in an instant. All that can be said is, if you have watched the video's on the net (released by konami) and think you have an idea of what the story is about you are completely wrong. The plot will twist and turn quite a bit but the end result is a very complete story, nearly every loose thread in the plot was somewhat tied together and explained a few times over. The voice work is top notch and every cutscene is as well directed as a movie, not watching the cutscenes in this game should be considered a crime. It should also be mentioned that if you havened played the other MGS's or don't know many of the plot points, you will be lost and confused in many of the cut scenes. MGS4 considers you know the long and twisted story kojima has come up with in detail, it does all get explained eventually but for most of the game you will be confused and may get bored because of it.SoundThe sound is perfect, each voice is done perfectly with each voice acter actually sounding like they wanted to be in the game. Gun sounds are nearly perfect (with the M4 easily being the best) and bring along a nice feeling to every gune, very surprising considering how disjointed guns in 3rd person games generally are.\\xa0GraphicsThe graphics are top notch for the system, I can't imagine the PS3 pulling off much more than what is done here. The frame rate in cutscenes can drop a bit and during game play when lots is going on you can see slight drops, each and every FPS hit is easily ignored as they are not horrible just noticable. Character faces and textures are possibly the highlight here, the textures are high res and the faces are smooth and detailed. The usual blocky look of ears and faces has also been removed, lines and curves on the face look smooth and natural although the ears can still look a little blocky at some angles.Metal gear onlineI will come back and review this at another time or edit this review as I havent had a long enough play of this yet, regardless to say its a standard jaunt through mediocrety. Nothing really that new here although its still fairly entertaining, given the free price tag.ConclusionWhat it comes down to is a simple yes or no, I cannot recommend this to anyone who hated MGS2 or 3. You will not find anything to like here as the cutscenes are just as pretentious and lengthy, the gameplay is much the same with a slight bit of emphesis on action over stealth.\\xa0If you liked MGS1-2-3 then you will like this, if you kept up with the story you will also find this to be a perfect completetion to the story. When I say complete I mean complete, other than the lingering stench of maybe a new hero and a sequal game the series is basically complete. Snake deserves it too, he has entertained me for years and thankfully has finished before he got stale.SoYes or NoYes - If you have played MGS 1-2-3 and liked them, then yes.\\xa0No - If you played MGS 1-2-3 and didn't like them at all, then no.Potatoes arn't for everyone.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'When someone says Battlefield what do you think of? Singleplayer? Multiplayer? If you said singleplayer than you must have been playing a different Battlefield for all these years, and Dice set out to create a worthwhile single player campaign with Bad Company. Single player does a great job of introducing you to all the various gadgets, and the characters are even funny sometimes. You have youre normal shouty sargeant, usual explosive crazed demolition guy (with a redneck twist) and for some reason, a nerd that can lug a LMG around, and then you have yourself, the jack of all trades, and master of all. I enjoyed several levels of the campaign, especially the one that took place on a golf course, but many of its levels are just a straight up slog through enemys that are insanely hard to see, you think it wouldnt be too hard since you have 3 buddys that come packing, but they rarely fire theyre guns to help you out, and often complain about having do all the work. The story is also occasionally funny but the ending leaves much to be desired. The main chunk of your time with BFBC should be spent with multiplayer though, and the new mode Goldrush. Goldrush is pretty much a attack and defend game type, but most of the time it heavily favors the defenders most maps but about 3 out of the 8. Thankfully though this issue should be resolved after DICE puts out an update that will allow the classic Battlefield Conquest mode to be played on all the maps. The classes are as balanced as always, and each class brings something unique to the table be it mortar strikes, land mines, C4, a needle that heals yourself, or a laser designator for calling in missles. Most land vehicles control well, and theres always a nice balance between firepower and armor on the vehicles, however helicopter are still crazy hard to control, and i hope eventually DICE makes some kind of crazy in depth tutorial on flying these things. Boats are also not a big focus and you will rarely need to use one, and in the future i hope to see a naval focused battlefield map. The expierince system works as well as you would expected, and isnt just a straight COD4 rip off like you would think. You will get extra points from things like headshots, saving a buddys life, or blowing up an objective. None of the\\xa0unlockable guns feel overpowered but several of them feel extremely weak (talking to you XM8). BFBC also features an award system simliar to COD4s challenges, but the awards have a bit more personality to them. The awards are divided into 3 groups, Trophies, Patches, and Wildcards. Trophies are the easiest to get, patches require multiple trophies, and wildcards are just for random stuff. Unlocking the awards is just plain fun, and adds some replayability to multiplayer.Overall Battlefield: Bad Company is a phenominal game, and every ascpecting of it is pretty awesome. The singleplayer is far better than the previous Battlefield single player expierinces but it definitely wont blow you away. The multiplayer is simply amazing, and makes up for singleplayers shortcomings, but seriously, when have you ever played Battlefield for singleplayer?',\n",

And let me tell you if there was ever a game with a great story this is it. So pretty much what the game is about is you trying to figure out who really killed your family and friend and why they framed you for doing it. While playing the game you will see about four or five different types of bad guys and some side characters who provide you with some hints as to where some weapons are or how to get past a certain part you are at which can be really helpful while also annoying. There is no multiplyer however because with multiplayer this game would have gotten a 10.0. The gameplay is just awsome from the Fireing the guns to just running around trying to find the right door to go in makes it for a very realistic experience and there is almost never a minute you go without having to kill a enemy. There are a few things that are not so realistic such as the slo-mo dive which helps a lot during the gun fights even though it is not realistic it is very helpful and fun. The sound is also very well done from the sound of the gun fireing in slow motion to the regular sound. The characters voices are very well done by the actors and actresses making sound very real and not corny or cheesy. The graphics are also very well done with no lag at all the graphics are just purely awsome. Overall If you have a Xbox, Ps2, or a pc GET THIS GAME. \",\n",

       "  'description': 'When the PS2 launched way, way back at the turn of the century, there were certain titles that we all expected to grace the console’s launch ceremony. Gran Turismo 3, Wipeout Fusion and Metal Gear Solid 2 all made it onto the market within a year of Sony’s sophomore console’s launch. Yet, strangely, one of the PlayStation’s biggest names seemed to have been overlooked; one Miss Croft missed out on the celebrations. We had to wait almost three years for the lovely Lara to make her PS2 debut in the form of Tomb Raider: The Angel Of Darkness, and I think I speak for most of us when I say we felt cheated. AOD was shoddy, awkward and clearly rushed (there was no excuse for this – the game had been in production for almost half a decade!).  It looked like Lara, like the rest of PlayStation’s mascots who hadn’t fared so well on the new generation console, had been irreversibly broken. The archaic formula and methodical pacing of the series didn’t have any place in the 21st century. So when Tomb Raider: Legend was announced I did my best to ignore the hype. I had no faith at all in new developers Crystal Dynamics. Being a ‘let sleeping dogs lie’ kind of person, I felt they were flogging a dead horse. Lara had let me down, and I didn’t think she would be able to compensate for it.  I was wrong. Boy, was I wrong. Tomb Raider: Legend is not only a return to form for the series, it’s also the best Tomb Raider yet. The product of around three years of careful crafting, Legend is the Tomb Raider game previous developers Core were afraid to make. Not only does it mess with the classic TR formula, it crushes it under its heel. And that’s a very good thing.  Tomb Raider: Legend abandons the cliffhanger ending of AOD in favour of an original story. This time around, Lara’s doing some research into the death of her mother. Before long, old pals from university and the legend of King Arthur all become intertwined with the focus of Lara’s quest. I won’t say too much, as it’s better to experience the plot first-hand. While it always falls just short of being believable, Legend’s story is nonetheless exciting and is sure to keep interested gamers playing through to the final moments.  Legend plays superbly, and that’s largely down to the completely reworked controls and gameplay mechanics. Jumping is no longer a chore; instead of having to line Lara up with the relevant ledge, the controls now feel tight and reliable enough to allow the player to make such jumps instinctively. Gone are the painstakingly slow, pixel-perfect jump moments. Lara is finally the confident, acrobatic adventurer we always knew she was. She can swing round poles, climb ropes and use a magnetic grapple, too. Granted, it may borrow from Ubisoft’s Prince Of Persia series, but the end result is a unique and well implemented gameplay system. As flashy as it all sounds, all these actions are accessible through one or two button presses, making Legend a joy to play without ever getting too complicated.  While exploration is certainly better this time round, combat feels a little lacklustre. The system is implemented well; the shoulder buttons fire whatever weapon Lara’s holding, while you can jump and roll for cover. To mix things up, there are a number of different weapons Lara can use (although she can only hold two at a time) and grenades. The age-old inventory has been done away with too, in favour of a slick interface controlled by the directional buttons. This way, you can switch weapons and heal yourself instantaneously, without interrupting the flow of combat. Unfortunately, the pitiful variety of enemies and generic feel of the weapons mean that Legend’s combat system feels a little weaker than the sum of its well thought out parts. Combat is a small part of the game though, so it shouldn’t trouble anybody too much.  Graphically, Legend is a sight to behold. Even though the PS2 hardware is right at the end of its shelf life, it’s still capable of producing amazing results. Lara looks the best she’s ever looked, and the myriad environments the story forces her through are all beautifully rendered. From the dense jungle and underground ruins of Ghana, to snowy Kazakhstan and the rooftops of Tokyo, the variety of the locales is just as impressive as their appearance. You’ll even get to explore an abandoned theme park in Cornwall. The animations are seamless and the HUD is clear. Aesthetically, Legend delivers everything you’d expect from a good action adventure game.  The sound is pretty impressive, too. All the music is very well suited to the locations and themes of Legend, and is so seamlessly integrated into the game that at times it affects you without you realising it. The sound effects are well implemented and the voice acting also stands out. Lara and her acquaintances are all very well-acted and, in Lara’s case, she’s regained the quintessential British-ness of the earlier Tomb Raider games. It all adds up to one very immersive experience that makes Legend very hard to put down.  Unfortunately this highlights another of the game’s problems; its brevity. Legend is a brilliant action adventure game, but like many others in its genre it’s simply too short. You’ll be lucky to clock up ten hours on your first playthrough. Granted, there are secrets to be found, and artwork and outfits to unlock. But even taking those into account, the game’s lifespan amounts to a matter of weeks rather than months. Players who know they can put this issue aside will love Legend, but those of you waiting for something to tide you over till next year should look elsewhere. Nonetheless, Tomb Raider: Legend is a very impressive action adventure game, and it looks like there’s life in the old girl yet.',\n",

       "  'description': '   Super Smash Bros. is one of Nintendo\\'s greatest game series ever created, by bringing well over 10 of Nintendo\\'s key franchises together to duke it out on the battlefield. Play as everyone\\'s favorite plumber, Mario, or even as the ever-so-lovable Pikachu. Who would win in a fight: Ganondorf from the Zelda Series or Bowser from the Mario series? You can find out with the aid of Super Smash Bros. Brawl at your side, or even better, in your Wii console. Super Smash Bros does well in bringing the greatest fan-service to Nintendo fans all over the world.Graphically, Super Smash Bros seems to be one of the best looking Wii games on the market today, right behind Mario Galaxy. However, visually, there are two ways you can play Brawl. You have the option of choosing either graphics that are razor sharp or nice and smooth; either way, it\\'s still playable. As well as the in-game graphics, Sakurai has done a great job with the cut scenes than can be viewed in the Adventure Mode, The Subspace Emissary (more on that later). The cut scenes are beautiful to look at and pleasant to the eye. There are also no voice-overs, which keeps most of Nintendo\\'s characters still mute heroes. Even the intro to the game is superbly made. Everything in the game, from the actual fighting to the beautiful cut scenes, are very fluid. It\\'s hard to stop watching and start playing. The graphics may be fantastic by Wii standards but it is nothing close to your Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare.Honestly, Nintendo has outdone themselves in the music department. With fully orchestrated music and tons of reminiscent songs, they have proven how the Wii isn\\'t just gameplay, but sound as well. The Brawl disc alone (about the size of a DVD) has about 300 songs in its inventory. Not only does the music sound stunning, even the melody of the menus will be stuck in your head (seriously). Many of the old songs are remixed though, giving it a modern twist on some old classics. A great thing that Nintendo did was that they let you decide how often you hear a certain song on a certain stage. If you absolutely hate one song (which is highly unlikely), you can set it up so that you don\\'t hear that song often or even at all. This also lets you set your favorite theme song as frequent as you want. Even the basic sounds of characters sound great. Pikachu\\'s \"Pika Pi\" and even Link\\'s grunt sound amazing. Hard to believe, right?The gameplay is basically unaltered from the previous Super Smash Bros titles, however it is still entertaining and has not even lost the lust from its 64 days. Compared to Melee, Brawl has many new features including a full adventure mode and Wi-Fi Online playability. However, the greatest change to the series is the new items, specifically the Smash Ball. The Smash Ball is essentially a bright, rainbow-colored ball withe the Smash Bros emblem floating around the screen. The characters have to break open the smash ball by attacking it to unleash an even greater attack. This special attack is referred to as the Final Smash, which is a fitting name since this attack can easily change the tide of a game. Solo-Mode still has the original Classic-Mode and All-Star Mode, which have also remained the same. However, the new adventure mode has changed since a longs way. The full-fledged adventure is now named the Subspace Emissary, where you control one of usually about 2 or 4 characters through a platforming adventure, much like Stage 1 of the Adventure mode in Melee. The Subspace mode is very tedious, however the cut scenes make the platforming worthwhile. If you do decide to play this, you have a chance of unlocking all 35 characters, which is a plus if you don\\'t want to play a ton of VS. Matches to unlock them. You still have your standard \"Break the Targets\", Event matches, Home Run Contests, and Multi-man Brawl as well. It might just be me, but I had hoped that \"Race to the Finish\" would return.The solo-mode, however, is nothing in comparison to the group-mode, Especially since the VS. Matches are where the game is at. There\\'s nothing like a crowd of people hovering around a television screen and cursing their little mouths off. This mode is great with friends, family and sometimes even by yourself. The new stages are outrageous, both in a good way and bad way. Some stages can be extremely annoying (such as the 75 MM Stage), but many are amazing. One stage I would like to discuss is the WarioWare stage, one of my favorite stages. In that stage you still have all your crazy brawling, but inside the stage is a dozen minigames that have that same WarioWare vibe from.The Wi-Fi matches are relatively lag-free... with friends anyways. There are three options you are given: Play with Anyone, Play with Friends, and Be a Spectator in an Online (Play with Anyone) Match. When you \"Play with Anyone\" you are basically fighting other random people online. Unfortunately there are almost no options available to you in online VS. and Friend matches. Random matches are automatically two minute time matches. Along with those limits, Random matches are broken. If you do decide to play this, you will lag a lot; so much that it is almost unplayable. With Friend matches it is usually lag-free and the recommended of the two Wi-Fi fighting. There are two cons about the friends matches. There is no voice-chatting, which takes away the craziness that is Super Smash Bros. As a replacement they use taunts, where you can type in your own messages. Nice, try, Nintendo, but no win. Another con is the fact that in order to brawl with a friend, the exchange of friend codes returns. With friends, you can also play a Multi-man brawl or Home Run Contest with them, but it is highly unlikely you\\'ll do that since Brawling tends to be more entertaining.Nintendo was nice enough to give us four different styles of play. The four controller types are Wiimote, the Wiimote and Nunchuk, the classic controller, and the Gamecube controller. The Wiimote is not as bad as everybody says it is, provided you are not a hardcore Super Smash Bros player. The Wiimote just makes a new way to play the game. The only real fault that I can find with playing like this is the shield aspect, where you have to hit the B button, which was very awkwardly placed. The Wiimote and Nunchuk control method is also very awkward, especially if you\\'ve been playing Super Smash Bros for a long time. Now, the classic controller and Gamecube controller is the recommended style of play. The best part of the controls is that Nintendo has let you customize where you want your buttons to be, so that it best suits you. That was a brilliant move by Nintendo.If you\\'re wondering how long you will be playing this game usually takes, the answer is indefinitely. Just like Melee, I can imagine gamers playing this a week from now, to a month from now, to a year from now, and maybe even a decade from now (if they haven\\'t already brought the sequel out by then). The replay value of this game is so high, that even casual gamers can find themselves playing this with their friends often. Take it from me, a game with this much replay hasn\\'t come out since the previous Smash Bros. iteration. Overall, Nintendo kept the same formula for Super Smash Bros. Brawl as they did in 64 and Melee, and it still works.- http://wiiniis-united.co.nr',\n",

But this time you are a cop (or detective)And this time its almost the same except this time you have mona sax on your side. Mona sax is wanted for murder and A a love interest of Max.Now the story in the first max payne was and is still good and Max payne 2 while its not as good as the first game's Plot it is still really good.So in Max payne in the end you get dragged off to jail in the end because you are suspected of murder, and in max payne 2 you get out of jail and are back to being a regular New York city cop. And in the first mission which is just a normal Murder investigation you discover someone is Killing off All the major thugs and Mafia members. So thats the basic's of the story (im not going to spoil anything for you).Once again there is no multiplayer which again as i said in my review for the first game is really disappointing because the gameplay the gunplay would be awesome for multiplayer. So again its disappointing that there is no multiplayer.The gameplay in the first max payne was and is still awesome which is back in max payne 2 and is just as good as the first game from the ragdoll effect (which is awesome) the gunplay, bullet time Now bullet time in max payne 2 is not the same as max payne instead this time you stay at normal speed while your enemies slow down and eventually you will become very fast while your enemies are still stuck in slow motion which makes it easier for you to take on even more bad guys and Thugs.There are still pain killers in the game to help heal the damage you have taken and if there were not any then the game would be impossible to get past.Now the one thing that I found bad about the gameplay is that it just seems to much like the first max payne. Other than that everything is Awesome in the gameplay. The graphics are a step up from the first game with nicer textures but there still are some sharp edges like in the first game. But the graphics still look better than ever.The game's sound is much like in the first game with the exception of that most of the guns have different sounds than in Max Payne. Speaking of guns there are 3 new weapons in the game including a MP5 SMG, Ak-47 assault rifle (although in the game its called something else) And a dragunov sniper rifle. Now back to the sound the voice acting is just as good as the first game's acting even though sometimes the acting can get cheesy.There is not much replay value in max payne but there are more levels of difficulty to play on and a new mode called dead man walking which is just you killing bad guys until they take you out.Over all if you have played the first Max payne and are wondering what the hell happens then get Max payne 2.Campaign: 9.8/10Multiplayer: 0/0 ( well there isn't any!)Gameplay: 9.9/10Tilt: 9.7/10graphics: 9.3/10Sound: 10/10funnessfactor: 10/10Replay value: 9.5/10\",\n",

In the single player you can play as any character That is unlocked instead of having to just play one character over and over again Which makes it have some replay value for the single player there is a story ( I think ) if there is a story its basically just you trying to get on the road to fame by completing the missions and some of the minigames in the campaign. What i mean about getting on the road to fame is that the commentator guy is pretty much a kung fu movie director and is trying to find someone to play in the movie. And to get in the movie you have to complete each mission (or battle) with a three star rating or higher to get past The battle and go on to the next one. The single player is somewhat like Adventure mode in Super smash bros melee. Meaning that the world around you moves as you are fighting enemies.There is co-op But not directly in the game (in the sense that you have to do a cheat on order to play Co-op) The matter of Co-op makes it have replay value since you can play with a friend ( or enemy ) But the down point of co-op is that the second player has to use the same character the first person chose whihc can mean some confusion with who is who. There are a few characters to choost from at first but the rest can be unlocked. My personnel favorite character is Lucy who totes a shotgun as her weapon.The Multiplayer is The main mode in the game and you can play up to four players or against AI bots.The game modes avilible in multiplayer are pretty much the same in the single player component But with the option to choose how the game will be won Such as choosing between deaths or lives and some others.You can also choose how fast the gameplay is, from slow-motion, normal and fast.Although there is little difference in how fast it is going but it is enough to notice.There are few worlds to choose From at first but you can unlock the rest of the characters, worlds and outfits by getting a 4 star rating or better in the battles of single player.There is also a miniseries mode to unlock which is just basically a bunch of mini games For up to also 4 players. Making this game almost a fighting/party game .And yet again another game mode called championship which is for only one player. Im not sure what happens in this mode but I think it is that you pick one of the characters and you have to defeat the rest in order to become the \"champion\" its a nice addition but does not prove to be as fun as the other modes.There is a freestyle mode which is just to fight it out with someone and there are no winners ( so in other words its just a practice mode).The games sound is pretty good but you will mainly notice the SFX in the game since the music is not very loud.The graphics are good, just good they are not stunning like in some other games but there is no lag so no complaints here.There are quite a few moves and combos for each player, each player has his ot hers own moves but the when you move onto the combos they are pretty much the same, each character has their own \"special\" attack which you can get by taunting other players after you have knocked them to the ground.The replay value is pretty high since yo can try and get a better rating in the single player to unlock more stuff, and the multiplayer adds hours of fun to it.Overall if you are just looking for a game to kill time with or to have a good time playing then kung fu chaos is for you.Gameplay: 9.8/10Tilt: 9.7/10Replay value: 9.9/10Funness factor: 10/10graphics: 8.9/10Sound: 9.3/10Multiplayer: 10/10Singleplayer: 9.1/10co-op: 9.0/10',\n",

       "  'description': ' Wii Review: Super Paper Mario  [Watch the Video Review]Since the start of the Wii console, gamers would wonder when the first Mario game for the platform would come out. In about 5-6 months, fans were rewarded with what they had wished for: Super Paper Mario. Super Paper Mario is the third in the Paper Mario series with the original \"Paper Mario\" on the Nintendo 64, \"Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door\" on the Gamecube and finally this on the Wii. Unlike the other games in the series though, instead of being an RPG, Super Paper Mario is a Side-scrolling Platformer.The game starts with Mario and Luigi hanging out at his house one day. They suddenly get interrupted when Toad barges in and tells them that Princess Peach has been captured. Mario and Luigi rush to Bowser\\'s Castle only to find out that Bowser wasn\\'t responsible for kidnapping her this time. They soon find out that a mysterious man in white, named Count Bleck, was the one behind the whole scheme. It shows that he posses the Dark Prognosticus. Count Bleck also captures Luigi and Bowser. Apparently his whole plan was for Princess Peach and Bowser to marry each other in order to obtain the Chaos Heart. Count Bleck sends his assistant, Nastasia, to hypnotize Princess Peach into going through with this. Count Bleck is successful and obtains the Chaos Heart. He then uses it to create a Void that will eventually grow large enough to vacuum in the whole universe. Mario then meets a Pixl named Tippi, who guides him to a Wizard named Merlon. Merlon informs Mario that he matches the description of the hero as described by another book called the Light Prognosticus. It is said that the hero can stop the void, thus starting Mario\\'s adventure. Mario\\'s objective is to collect all 8 Pure Hearts in order to stop Count Bleck from banishing the whole universe to nothing. Interlaced throughout the story, there is actually a pretty touchy love story that will form a huge twist within the end of the game.When you first look at the cover you can sense this game has a very cartoony feel to it. It\\'s not going to have a Grand Theft Auto IV type of visuals mainly because this game is aimed at kids. There usually won\\'t be any kind of blur or pixelation, but the graphics seem very dated. It was fine on the Nintendo 64 and even better on the GameCube, but now it just seems that we\\'ve seen a bit too much of these graphics. Honestly, these graphics look too much like the Gamecube predecessor and it doesn\\'t look like it has changed much either. The characters, however, look very cute; almost like a chibi-version of them. the levels look nice, especially with many different types of environments, such as underwater and in space. The most impressive thing though, is the switch from 2D-3D Transitions. In 2D the game looks great, but in 3D it looks fantastic.The music in Super Paper Mario is one of the most elegantly composed selection in any game I have ever heard. The soundtrack is basically a remixed version of some old tunes, a risk Nintendo took, but it seemed to work out fine. The best thing about the music is that it seems to go perfectly into the level design. The music is pretty much and usually the type of fun, overly happy kind of music that you would expect from Paper Mario. Honestly, you love the music but sometimes the music can get a little annoying, especially in the main town (Flipside). The music is excellent, but sometimes just seems a bit too childish.What separated this game from the rest of the series is the change in genres. The past two Paper Mario games were RPGs, whereas Super Paper Mario is a Side-Scrolling Platformer. The greatest change is the use of being able to g from 2D to 3D. When you are in 2D, the game should look like a regular Paper Mario game, however, if you change to 3D, you basically see the same place, but on from the side. Some enemies that were in 2D may turn into just a thin line of paper in 3D mode. This change of how you can look at the levels play very well with level design and the such. Usually if you are stuck, try using 3D. You may find this may be a \"way to cheat\" by using 3D all of the time, but there is only a set time limit of how long you can stay 3D. A meter on the top left corner of your screen should start depleting whenever you go 3D. To recharge the meter,just step back into 2D, until it recharges on its own. Also, if you go past the time limit given, your meter will return full but at the cost of some HP. There is also a new idea of Pixls that help you around. At a time, you can have up to two Pixls out with you. You can choose one Pixl from the menu and the other Pixl is Tippi, who can help you with a description of your enemy or by making hidden objects/doors appear. You can acquire new Pixls by finding them throughout the story. One Pixl can turn into a bomb and another can become a platform that you ride on. The Pixls act almost as weapons or a special ability in the game. Another great thing about this game is that you can play as multiple characters, including Princess Peach and Bowser, but to try and keep this review spoiler free, I will say no more.The game is played with the Wiimote turned to its side, as if playing Super Mario Bros. on the Virtual console. Players can shake the Wii Remote to pull off stylish moves that give you more points. You also shake the Wii Remote if you want to break out of ice. There are also, almost, microgames when you use certain items, usually the offensive items. If you point the Wii Remote towards your screen, you can get advice from Tippi, as mentioned above. The only beef I really have with the controls is that it could have used more motion controls instead of just to pull off combos and items.Now since this is an Adventure game, you may think that once you beat the story you beat the game. While that is usually true for most games, Super Paper Mario begs to differ. With the idea of collecting trading cards in the game, most will try to collect them all just to beat the game 100%. Even after that though, you may come back to Super Paper Mario to replay some of your favorite levels. Super Paper Mario is a fun, quirky game with level designs incredibly entertaining, but the graphics gives this game a childish reputation.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Civ Rev is the first game of the series that I have touched. From what I hear, this is a more stripped-down version of the game, but just as addictive and fun. The reason for this is because it's on a console, and what they do with the game is take away the more tedious processes while tuning the controls making it easy for any strategy lover.Pros+Addictive and strategic.+Intuitive interface.+Charismatic leaders.+Interesting progression of civilizations.Cons-Your advisors speak annoying gibberish.-Slower paced, definitely not for everyone.-Riflemen can destroy fighter planes, granted this is all based on stats.--------------Gameplay--------------As you may understand, the point of Civ Rev is to take a civilization from 1600 AD to the future. You pick from one of the 16 leaders featuring famous and well-known names such as Lincoln for America or Cleoptra for Egypt. Your goal is to win by achieving one of 4 possibilities: Economic, Cultural, Domination, or Technology victories. When you begin the game you'll start off with a settler, choose where to begin your first capitol, churn out a couple warriors and begin exploring and advancing. You usually face off against 4 or so opponents, and whether you wish to make peace or war is entirely up to you. Eventually you'll go through a few eras making ground, water, and even air units. The fascinating thing is how they develop, you may start out with warriors using swords, but then you will be using horsemen, riflemen, canons, battleships, submarines, all the way up to nukes. As you develop your town it becomes asthetically beautiful, making for an interesting concept. It's not surprising to see a Babylonian Garden in the same vicinity as a launch pad for rocketships.Another part of the strategy is how you interact with aides and leaders who will constantly annoy you with mostly useless information (once you understand the game anyway). Thankfully there are 5 different difficulties challenging you to a variety of extents, from Chieftan to Deity. There's also a multiplayer addition, where you have 3 game modes to choose from (head to head, free for all, team).----------------------Graphics/Sound----------------------Graphics are bright, colorful and cartoony with a light-hearted sense of humor. All of the civilization leaders are overdramatic in their features which makes it so different, and the cities look awesome when you're nearing the end of the game and you have 25 buildings crammed into a single city. Sounds of your aides is annoying, but you can turn off their gibberish.--------Value--------Civ Rev retails at $59.99. Depending on how you feel about strategy games, this can give you quite a bit of replayability. On top of the regular games which last an hour and a half to 2 and a half hours, there are a couple scenarios with pre-defined objectives. Then there are the multiplayer modes, and of course achievements. If you are a bit iffy on this game, there's a demo on the marketplace you can give a try since it has most of the features as the full game. [Just to note, this review was originally on my GS account which is why it's in the current format.]\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Professor Layton and the Curious Village is indeed a curious game. As if there weren't enough brain training games out there already, this one takes brain busting to a whole new level. Hidden behind the mask of the quaint town of St. Mystere, the story of Professor Layton and the Curious unfolds as you search for the Golden Apple by solving puzzle after puzzle. You play as Professor Layton and his young, eager assistant Luke, who are invited to the village by one Lady Dahlia after the death of her husband. Your main task is to search for the mysterious Golden Apple, but as fate would have it, the Professor and Luke discover that there is far more to this mystery than meets the eye.  Gameplay: In order to progress through the game, you must solve puzzles. These puzzles are either given to you by the different people you talk to in the village or by discovering them. But at times it gets so ridiculous that glancing at a mere dirty jar on the road will remind Layton or Luke about a puzzle they have heard about. As for the puzzles themselves, they range from being childishly simple to punishingly difficult; this can be seen by the amount of Picarats each one is worth. The more Picarats the harder the puzzle will be. Some of the harder puzzles will definitely have you scratching your head for a much longer period of time than what you're willing to spend on them. At times the difficulty of a given puzzle will get to be so hard that you'll probably just end up searching the internet for the answer. Exploring the town of St. Mystere is done by tapping on an icon on the touch screen and simply choosing which direction to move in. Each new area has more puzzles to be found, however, the puzzles do not remain in their locations forever. But don't fret; a simple trip to Granny Riddelton's shack will have you racking your brain again in no time.  Graphics: The originality of the art in Professor Layton & the Curious Village is definitely a sight to see. The game's hand drawn style adds to the games antiquated feel, and further enhances the atmosphere of the game. The game also features some animated cut scenes that are truly remarkable, the quality of the movies are absolutely crisp and clear for the DS. The cartoony style of each individual character adds a certain distinction that separates this game from others.   Sound: The score for Professor Layton is something that is very different from what we hear in other games out there. The accordion laced soundtrack in the game gives a very warm and inviting feel, which is something that is definitely needed if you would want to play this game for hours on end. But for all this game delivers it definitely has enough content and length to keep you playing for a while, and with the addition of weekly downloadable puzzles Professor Layton won't be leaving your DS' cartridge holder for a long time.\",\n",

       " {'deck': '1080 Avalanche review by Termite',\n",
       "  'description': 'Game Review: 1080 Avalanche1080 Avalanche is a Gamecube game released on December 1st 2003 and is the sequel to the rather popular Nintendo 64 game 1080 Snowboarding.The gameplay is very racing based, unlike other snowboarding games such as the SSX series where tricks are the main attraction. The races take place on numerous stages and pit you against another computer player or human player in a race to the finish.The races are divided up into a few different difficulties and there is a fair number of tracks for you to race on. There are also different characters with different attributes to choose from. These characters also have unlockable snowboards and outfits. Every character even has a special character with exactly the same attributes that you can unlock. All of this is fine and dandy and some people like me for instance might feel the urge to unlock every single thing present in the game, but this plethora of stuff seems to be in stark contrast to the actual length of the game.This game is short, very short. I breezed through all the difficulties and tracks in one or two sittings. While you might think it would be remedied by all those unlockable goodies, I don\\'t think it is because most normal people simply aren\\'t going to be trying to get them. I just had to get that out of the way quickly, as that is surely the game\\'s worst point.Anyway, on to some more positive aspects of the game. The graphics are very nice for a Gamecube game and the track design has lots of nice looking scenic areas for you to snowboard around. Especially good looking is the Avalanche. There are I believe 2 avalanches that you can encounter in the game, the first one you might miss however ( I haven\\'t been playing the game in a while so if this isn\\'t so, sorry ) and the second one is at the end of the game. These avalanches are really exciting and are a centerpiece for the game.The sound is arguably even better than the graphics. It has a pretty large soundtrack, filled mostly with rock and alternative songs which can really get you pumped up for a race. And you can choose which song you want to listen to while at the loading screen, which just makes it better.The game controls well, and I didn\\'t encounter any problems with that. The whole \"Spin the joystick when you lose balance\" mechanic is kind of badly made however. Basically when you land a bit off center you have to spin the stick to get back upright, and this whole sequence is in slow-motion. But the problem lies in the fact that not only are you viewing this is slow motion, your character actually is in slow motion. So if it\\'s a close race a slightly missed landing can cost you the game ( Which, as you can guess is not very fun ).The trick system is rather dull, which is no surprise as the game isn\\'t centered around tricks but more around racing. You won\\'t find much to captivate you here. The reward for pulling off enough tricks is that you can become invincible. Well, by invincible I mean that if you fall you recover instantly and if you bump into an opponent you send them flying into the air and then they will crash, which can be quite useful. You will lose your invincibility after you do either of these things though, and I found myself not really needing these powers at all as the game isn\\'t especially difficult.So, if you don\\'t mind the lackluster length I think you can enjoy this game quite a lot. It will also help if you are the sort of person who likes items and unlocks and stuff like that, because if you do that will significantly increase the length.Overall: 4/5',\n",

This game has revolutionized the MMO genre, claiming over 12 million subscriptions. It has been called addicting for its never ending gameplay. They currently have the level up at 70 and have released an expansion, with more coming up. They have many classes over many rases over the Horde and Alliance. PvE is extremely fun with hundreds and hundreds of spells, huge monsteres and bosses, the deep sea, high mountrains and awesome quests!! They have lots of huge areas so theyres always more quests, monsters and place to discover. Mounted travel at level 30 and griphons are very fun to use and can get you traveled quickly. The dungeons are huge, bright, brutal and fun and with guilds, you can make friends just so quickly. Say, for example your quest says that you have to kill 30 ice demons in this certain area so your there, kill them in a brutal, fun fashion on the icy terain when someone else comes and starts killing some mobs, you say hey, they say hey back, you both finish a quest, level up, distribute skill points, learn 10 new spells, make a friends then go to the battlegrounds to PvP and get hundreds of fun kills. Im not even scratching the surface, im miles from the surface using a microsoft too look down at it, this game is HUGE!I cant put into words how phenominal this game is, i just cant, theres new content added all the time, millions of things to do and its extremely fun.If you own a PC, you should get it. If you dont, get a PC and play it!My rating scale depends on the platform and genre its on. Since PC has much more awesome games on it, i mark much harder on it so a 80% on PC would mean its great compared to the hundreds of other awesome PC games of that genre, and might be better than a 98% of consoles. A great game is a great game, on the system. I like to keepy my reviews short and sweet, so i wont bore you and get to the point.

       "  'description': \"All too often these days, games are attempting to push the boundaries of the industry by either shocking their target audience or introducing some never-before-seen-but-actually-pretty-lame innovation. Most new releases will tend to fall into one of these two categories. Games like Grand Theft Auto and God Of War offer mutilation and other depravities in abundance, while serial updates (particularly EA sports sims) seem to find it necessary to bring in a gimmick with every annual instalment. And after all, why shouldn't they? Isn't this what gamers want?  Step forward Wild World, the most recent addition to Nintendo’s Animal Crossing franchise and about as far removed as you can get from convention. You won’t find any gore or gimmicks here, oh no. Animal Crossing is a real-time life simulation. From the outset, you’re plonked into a town where you plan to set up home. You take long walks in the countryside, fish, catch bugs, visit the local landmarks once in a while and chat with the other residents of your town (a rather odd bunch of animals), all with the eventual aim of paying off your mortgage. There’s no storyline, so to speak, nor any real ending. You just... live.  Wild World does nothing to mess with this formula, and converts it to the DS handheld extremely well. While the style of the gameplay will undoubtedly put people off, gamers searching for a relaxing change of place will certainly find that here. Yes, it is simple and twee, but never in an insulting way. The constantly evolving game world (which, as I’ve already said, plays out in real time thanks to your DS’ internal clock) keeps the game fresh and the ability to dive into and out of the game whenever you like keeps it from getting too repetitive.  In terms of how the actual playing of the game is handled, Nintendo have done a fantastic job of making Animal Crossing “touch-friendly”. Fans of both stylus and buttons will be satisfied, as Wild World caters for both styles by offering two methods of control and the opportunity to switch between them at any time. That being said, menu navigation feels faster with the stylus, which permits drop-and-dragging of items and faster scrolling. Wireless communication allows players to visit friends’ towns, and those of you who have Wi-Fi will be able to visit towns from all over the globe. It’s a nice touch that also opens up new items and features to you.  Graphically, Wild World is pretty impressive. The graphics are 3D and the cute, pleasant atmosphere they create fits in well with the game’s concept. The game’s characters and environments are not lavishly detailed, but the cohesiveness the visuals provide helps to create a sense of consistency and maintain the illusion of a living, breathing environment. The game’s sound is something of a mixed bag, though. A lot of the music is simple but fits in well with the game, and the ability to compose your own town tune is a nice touch, but the annoying animal voices feel intrusive. Thankfully, the option to turn them off is available.  Because Wild World is a life simulation, it never really ends. The real time aspect allows players to work through the game at their own pace, and as such it doesn’t have a lifespan. Some will play it every day, while others may only dive into Wild World once a week. It’s a game where your playing style determines the flow. You could easily while away hours by becoming addicted to the game’s myriad distractions (fishing and bug collecting to name but two). The length of Wild World is entirely dependent on how much time you’re willing to put in.  In conclusion, Wild World is the perfect on-the-go answer for anybody looking for a change of pace from the relentless flow of most games. The relaxed gameplay and cohesive world created within one little DS cartridge provide players with an experience unlike any other for the console. As I said, it won’t appeal to everybody. But if you want something different for your money, you can’t go wrong with starting a new life in the Wild World of Animal Crossing.\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'No More Heroes offers a unique art style, some catchy tunes, but ',\n",
       "  'description': ' Wii Review: No More Heroes  No More Heroes is the newest game from Suda-51 and Grasshopper studios, the developers of Killer7. The quality that will attract most people is its unparalleled style that could only come from the mind of Suda-51. No More Heroes offers a unique art style, some catchy tunes, but most importantly: a sense of humor.In the world of No More Heroes, you, Travis Touchdown, are a stereotypical otaku that lives in a motel in Santa Destroy. After winning a Beam Katana, which very much resembles and bares a similar name to the Light Saber, he is ranked as the eleventh ranked assassin of the United Assassins Association (UAA). When Travis gets tricked into killing Number 10 by Sylvia Cristel, Travis\\' basic mission hander, he becomes a target for assassinations. Because of this, he decides if he will be on an assassination list anyways, he should be Number 1.The very first thing you will notice about this game is that the art style varies much from other games you are now used to. The game uses a cell-shaded art style, and it works out fine for this type of game. The design of the game is exceptional, however the characters not only look exciting but really delivers as well. The city itself is very colorful, however there are problems with it. You will encounter some framerate issues and the fluidity of the game slows down. Also some buildings don\\'t show their features such as doors, windows and signs until you actually get close to it, which can sort of be annoying. The most interesting part of the visuals, in my opinion, is the map. The map is produced in 8-bit, which brings back memories of the great NES days. Graphically, the cell-shaded graphics and environments are very nice and although there are a few problems, they will not affect the gameplay.As far as sound effects go, they are great. Much like No More Heroes\\' map, there are also some old-school video game sound effects, such as \"beeps\" and \"boops\". Yeah, you know what I\\'m talking about. One thing about the music really annoys me though. There is no music when you are exploring the city of Santa Destroy, only car horns and what-not. Oh, wait! There is music... when Travis is on his motorbike. Another gripe I have with this is the voice acting. Although, they are pretty well done, they make every single boss assassin and Sylvia sound like stereotypical immigrants. Sylvia has that annoying French accent, which you may or may not like. The first boss you encounter is some English dude... and yes, with the British accent. There are pretty much no real problems with sound at all, minus some of the voice acting and the lack of music in Santa Destroy.The game is divided to two different gameplay aspects, sandbox free roaming and hack and slash battles. The latter is where the game shines with unique characters, humor and great boss battles. Unfortunately the flipside isn\\'t nearly as entertaining. Combat is simple and rewarding. Of course the ranking battles are the most fun as you get to fight all the outrageous bosses of the game. When you\\'re not fighting the next ranked assassin, you will be doing several other things to keep you occupied. You will have to do jobs in order to get money in order to pay for your next ranked match. You will be doing a variety of missions in order to get this money such as lawn mowing, collecting coconuts, and cleaning walls which are used to kill time but are not very entertaining. Along with side-jobs, you can actually shop with the money that you earn if you do not want to get into the next ranked battle just yet. You can buy new clothes, which may I add is too expensive, work out, buy an upgrade for your beam katana, and even feed your cute little kitty, Jeane.When you think of sword-slashing on the Wii you think of waggle, waggle, waggle. This feature came to be very annoying, and sometimes even caused some soreness. No More Heroes thinks of a brilliant way to implement the motion controls without the onslaught of it either. To attack with the beam katana, you basically button mash the A button and you do melee attacks with the B Button. In battle, the motion controls are implemented as well as stated above. When an enemy is almost defeated, No More Heroes gives you a chance to finish your opponent off with a \"fatality\" move of sorts. A blinking arrow will appear on the screen where you must flick your Wii remote in to slash their body in that direction. You can also use wrestling moves on your enemies, which also uses the on-screen arrow, but instead uses both the Wii remote and nunchuk to activate. Motion controls are also activated when you are riding your motorbike. You can flick the Wii remote upwards to perform a jump. There is also a baseball mini game mission, where you swing your beam katana to kill enemies within the ball\\'s line of fire.When you play the game for the first time, you have two difficulty levels to choose from: sweet and mild, your basic easy and normal. Once you\\'ve finished the game on either difficulty, you can start a new game with a harder difficulty setting and keep all of your items from the previous playthrough. As for the difficulty, excluding some of the boss battles, this game is fairly easy.If you are looking for a fun time where you can also look at something visually appealing at the same time, this is the game to get. Especially with humorous dialogue and an overkill of blood (in the US versions at least), you will not want to put it down... that is unless you\\'re doing one of the boring side-missions. However, if you are looking for real challenge, you should look somewhere else. This isn\\'t a must-have for Wii owners, but it should be warranted to check out. Rent it first, as some people do not enjoy this game, but if you do enjoy it, buy it.',\n",

       " {'deck': 'Super Smash Brothers Brawl; best Wii game yet?',\n",
       "  'description': 'It can certainly be argued that the new installment of the Super Smash Brothers series is one of, if not THE best game in the Wii\\'s library thus far.Its combination of cute graphics and in depth gameplay make it a very accessible title over a wide range of audiences. But has it got something for everyone?Firstly, the character roster has been expanded a lot, whereas in previous titles there were a lot of characters that were hardly any different, such as Mario and Dr. Mario, Pikachu and Pichu, Marth and Roy, etc, Brawl has taken that aspect of the previous title and ditched it for favour of a whole new line of characters. It is most impressive to see some other non-Nintendo characters make their appearance in all their glory, like Sonic and Solid Snake, who are both a valuable addition to the game\\'s roster. In most cases, it must be said that Super Smash Brothers Brawl definetly caters for a wide audience, while the gameplay is centered around one specific target; annihilating your enemies. The fluid controls (in all of the forms, the GameCube pad, Classic Pad, Remote and Nunchuk or the Remote singularly) are used in conjunction with the speed and flow of the game to great effect, helping it to be a very immersive experience without the graphical capabilities of some PlayStation 3 titles, which is an achievment in itself for the Wii.Moving on to the available play options, well... There\\'s a lot to mention. There are many modes to keep new players and returning players entertained, the newest addition being the \"Subspace Emissary\", a revamped adventure mode for Brawl. If you\\'re thinking this is the same deal as the adventure mode from Super Smash Brothers Melee, you\\'d be dead wrong. The SSE has quite an in depth story, albeit a confusing one at times, but it is linked into the gameplay spectacularly, allowing you to see the story form from the viewpoint of all the characters in the game. Each character on the roster has a small role to play in the story, and the player has the option to choose which to play through first. The lush CGI scenes work well when blending back into the gameplay, especially the colourful freeze-frames which take place when it is the player\\'s time to choose their character for that segment of the story. SSE will keep players gripped and playing for a long time, even for experienced gamers, there is still quite a bit of meat here to get your teeth into. The only possible \"downside\" to this mode, is that nearly all of the characters (excluding Wolf and Jigglypuff) can be unlocked in one playthrough of the SSE, which may leave it to be a dead part of the game for many people after the first completion, but overall, I feel it is a huge success.I would go out on a limb to say that SSE is the \"main beef\" of the game, but in hindsight, the 4 player battles in the previous titles have held replay value to its maximum, and it hasn\\'t changed with the arrival of Brawl. A huge array of items and play modes are available, quick timed games or drawn out survival battles make for some chaotic, explosive fun, and more often than not, quite a few arguements aswell. The introduction of the \"Smash Ball\" makes battles turn into a frantic scrabble to see which player can break it first, thus unlocking their Final Smash ability, which really puts the odds in their favour. These, along with the character models and insanely well designed arenas help to show off the Wii\\'s graphical potential. It\\'s quite shocking to see the difference from the original Smash Brothers to Smash Brothers Brawl, in both gameplay and graphics, it has advanced so well. For those times during the times of Melee, whenever you couldn\\'t bring your friends over for a few bouts, it was a case of setting up 3 enemy CPUs. This could get somewhat tedius, even when playing at the highest difficulty level, once you figured out the way that the AI played, you could easily overcome it. With the new release, this has been counteracted somewhat by the introduction of ONLINE PLAY. (Finally... Right?)For the majority of the time, this works astoundingly well (although the forced anonymity in the matches is somewhat of a letdown) and is a major asset to the game. While it is fun to search for randomers online to beat down on, it is again a lot more fun to play against people you know. Players have access to their own customisable profile when playing online, making their name viewable, and customisable taunts to be used in battle. More often than not, hilarity ensues with the constant \"LOL\" \"YOU SUCK\" \"HAHA FAIL\" bubbles appearing mid-fight, and it helps to make the Brawl experience more fun when your friends are not sat in the same room as you, keeping gameplay fresh and fun.Overall, I think this is a great game for the Wii and can arguable re-define fighting games in its own unique way. The fun is unmatched in most multiplayer games, and there is a lot of unlockable content available for the more hardcore fans making this game a lengthy, enjoyable experience.',\n",

       "  'description': \"The good stuff: - Gorgeous looking enviroments with crisp texture detail - Great character movement with sharp control - A ton of different ways to blow your opponent into pieces The bad stuff: - Not much in the way of content compared to the prequel Unreal Tournament - Weapons feel underwhelming  Unreal Tournament released in 1999 was a superb game with high detailed models, a variety of unique weapons that felt really good, a ton of maps and alot of ways to customize the gameplay experience with a handful of mutators and very customizable match rules. Fast-forward to the future and in late 2002 we have Unreal Tournament 2003 with an all new game engine which is nothing short of visually stunning. Unreal Tournament 2003 is just as much fun to play, however, it isn't all that you would expect from an sequel.  The first thing you will notice upon starting a match is that the game just looks beautiful. High polygon models and enviroments, high detail and crisp textures and wonderful lightning. The amount of detail that can be seen in one small map is superb. Every level is decorated with lots of meshes that stray from simple geometry. The big outdoor enviroments is just a whole another thing with jaw dropping visuals. The only bad thing you could say about Unreal Tournaments 2003's graphics is a lack in shadows, and the shadows do seem rather unrealistic. But the game looks gorgeous anyway that you probably couldn't care less.  Unreal Tournament 2003 plays wonderfully. You have alot of control over your character's movement with very responsive and sharp controls. You have quite a good bit of air control, and a ton of control of how and where you want to jump too. This kind of movement makes for some very competitive gameplay online, and the maps where designed with this in mind with plenty of opportunities to do a running jump dodge onto that otherwise unreachable area which allows for quick access to a power-up. This may sound intimidating, and at first it is. The movement definatly takes a bit of time to get used to, but once you do you just can't go back to another first person shooter without it.  A new mechanic in Unreal Tournament 2003 is the addition of adrenaline. Adrenaline is gained by picking up pills scattered across the map or by fragging your opponents. Once you gain a hundred adrenaline (Indicated by the HUD at the top left) you will be able to activate one of four different abilities which depend on the key combo you used. You activate an adrenaline ability by pressing a four key combo using the arrow keys. Up, Up, Up, Up for example activates speed which makes you run really fast for a small period of time. If you get killed whilst using an adrenaline ability however you will respawn with no adrenaline.  Some of the traditional gameplay modes make a comeback in Unreal Tournament 2003 which are Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and capture the flag. Assault and Domination haven't returned but two new modes are Bombing Run and Double Domination. Double Domination is similar to Domination found in Unreal Tournament in that there are control points located on the map and two teams have to try and capture and hold them. With Double Domination there are only two control points on symmetrical maps and a team can only score if they hold both control points for a period of ten seconds. Bombing Run is like the bloody sport of Unreal Tournament combined with rugby or American football. A ball is spawned in the center of a symmetrical map and must be put through one of the teams goals to score. If you are holding the ball you cannot shoot any weapons, instead your weapons are replaced with the ball thrower for as long as you have the ball. You can shoot anywhere you want or you can pass to a teammate with a lock on feature.  While Unreal Tournament 2003 has enough content to keep anyone satisfied for a long period of time, it doesen't pack in as much as what was included with Unreal Tournament. A handful of the mutators seem to be missing and there only seems to be about half as many maps. What there is tough is some well balanced and competitive maps and many different character models to choose and play with. Some fans from Unreal Tournament may be a bit annoyed to find the Ripjack (A weapon that shoots sharp metal spinning disks which could bounce of walls and make for some easy head shots) has not been included and the redeemer is gone. Instead of the redeemer there is a weapon called the Ion Painter in which you indicate via a tracer where you want to strike. You must remain still for a few seconds and then an orbital ion strike will rain down on the unfortunate combatants that happen to be in it's path.  All the weapons in Unreal Tournament 2003 look really good and are well balanced. There are some changes made to them such as the Flak Cannon has a tighter spread but they remain familiar to what was in Unreal Tournament. However they all feel underwhelming. The shield gun (Unreal Tournament 2003's Impact Hammer) can be used to slaughter an opponent with a close range impact and the alternate fire can be used to project a shield around the front of the character. But the primary fire just doesen't give much satisfaction, you just walk up to someone and it's as if they disappear with a blood splatter. Same with the Rocket Launcher. You would expect it to look very powerful and sound deafening, but the rockets give off a small, weak explosion and the sound of the rockets getting thrown out of the launcher is quiet.  Whilst Unreal Tournament 2003 doesen't have as much content as you would hope for, it's still a solid, fast paced and competitive multiplayer shooter. Anyone who likes first person shooters should definatly check out Unreal Tournament 2003.\",\n",

As most of you know the battlefield series stands out for its multilayer faction of the game. BF Bad Company changes that totally, as you find yourself on a true single-player campaign as opposed to previous installments. You are part of the B company. The B company is where all the army renegades if you will, are sent to deal with hence the name Bad Company.  You will find that the characters have depth as you\\'ll find yourself laughing a few minutes by the different situations they have to overcome. Regarding game play if you\\'ve played a lot of CoD 4 as I have you\\'ll find the controls a bit awkward but after a few minutes of play you will find just right. As of military games we are living on a post CoD 4 era and we tend to judge everything by it. Well I highly recommend you get this game or at least rent it, to find out that it\\'s more than a rental.   Vehicles!!, yes! you can drive different types, as they add to the whole experience, as you can bring the destruction mayhem up a notch. Just imagine yourself driving a tank through the enemy lines quite interesting huh?   Now to multi-player, the destruction mania extends to it, thats right you will find yourself tearing through walls to find your prey (if you will), the games has kinda a perk system a la CoD but with another name Classes. The multi-player mode is called Gold Rush,\\xa0 the whole purpose of the attacking team is to destroy two gold crates and the defending team purpose is self explanatory. When playing rank matches you will gain Xp and unlock points that you will use to well unlock guns, if you get the standard edition as I did you will have to wait until rank 25 to unlock the guns that come as a \"bonus\" in the gold edition.  To conclude BF Bad Company made rethink my anti-EA policy now i think they can actually make good games. The single-player campaign and the multi-player mode you\\'ll find yourself pleased.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Chrono Trigger was an amazing game back when it was released in 1995. Unfortunately not many people had played it. If you were one of the people who were fortunate enough to have played it you probably completely understand why this game gets 4 and a half stars. This is a game with a great cast and a great story and great gameplay. The graphics were also great for their time and still look very sharp today. The story consists of a young boy who goes to a fair and accidentally bumps into a girl. They talk to each other and decide to meet one of the young boy, Crono, 's friend Lucca. They meet her at these teleporters which sub sequentially transports Marle the young girl who\\xa0 met Crono to the year 600 A.D. From this time onwards you are traveling over many periods of time and meet outstanding characters from every time. Frog from 600 A.D who talks in old english, and for some reason is the only person from his time to still speak like this. Robo a robot from the future who is incredibly intelligent for something without a brain. Ayala who is from prehistoric times who is the strong girl who doesn't speak much but doesn't really need too. You will also meet plenty more characters within this amazing story. The game play is different from most rpgs of its time. There are no random battles, you can see enemies you are about to fight. When you do get into a battle the screen doesn't change just the battle menu pops up right onto your screen and you fight in that room or area. Once you get to the end of the game there are separate side quests for each member of your party. These delve way more into each specific story line of the characters than the normal story arc itself. Then you are at the end of the game. This is where the game makes its one and only mistake, it is to short. The story is fairly easy to plow through in a bout 20 hours without doing many side quests which is unfortunate because the game is an outstanding one with a\\xa0 story that will suck you in. All in all Chrono Trigger was an amazing game which still holds up today as an amazing game.\",\n",

       "  'description': ' Wii Review: Wii Sports \"Twas the night before Christmas and all I could see,was a decently large box that I hoped was a Wii.I giggled and chuckled at the thought of such fun,and the console, once ridiculed, was now #1.The next morning I ripped open the box and my intuition was right,For when I opened the gift all I saw was a bright, holy light.Then I saw what I had wished for:A Wii at my presence and I couldn\\'t ask for more.I set up my Wii,my face shining with glee.I looked all around for a game to be played,But then I saw Wii Sports, no extra money had to be paid!I popped in the Disk and began my paradefor this was the 1st Wii game both made and a must-play...\"All right, all right. I know it\\'s lame and it\\'s a little bit too early/late for a Christmas poem but I couldn\\'t help it. Anyways, when you buy your Wii it should come with a game titled Wii Sports for free. This is a game that showcases the Wii\\'s capabilities and proves most doubts about the console false. This game basically turns your Wiimote into a tennis racket, baseball bat, a golf club, boxing gloves, and... your fingers in a bowling ball. As you can tell there are a variety of Sports you can play from this one Wii game alone. The five sports that are featured are tennis, baseball, bowling, golf, and boxing. It is a great game for both single-player and multi-player.Wii Sports is a basic package, but all 5 sports provide fun for whatever you feel like playing. You may get so involved in the game, that you actually scratch or even break your TV. Yes, it\\'s happened before. Not to me specifically, but this point is not a negative one. This means that people get so into the game and they actually feel like they are the Mii. Now let\\'s discuss the five sports within the game.Tennis is, in my opinion, the most amusing of all five games. You start the game by choosing your Mii. This game can support one to four different players at once, making it a great party game. Unfortunately, you can\\'t play a singles court but you shouldn\\'t mind playing doubles. If you are playing by yourself, you can either make your partner a CPU or control both players. The most awkward thing about Wii Tennis is that when you actually start playing you have no control over your Miis. The Miis automatically follow the ball, which can either annoy you or relieve you. To swing the racket, it\\'s as easy as a slight flick or an all-out swing of your Wiimote. The motions are very responsive, which means you don\\'t always have to give yourself the \"Wii Arm\" when playing Wii Tennis. Now please remember that how fast you swing will not affect the ball at all; it is just the timing in which the racket hits the ball. It is very simple as you cannot control where your Miis walk. Wii Tennis makes for some great single-player options, but multiplayer is where this game really shines.Baseball is one of the more complex games of the bunch. Wii Baseball supports one to two players at once: You on one team, your friend on another. Wii baseball is basically all reaction time, especially when you\\'re up to bat. When the ball starts coming at you, you have to time your swing at the right time. If you swing too fast you\\'ll swing before the ball even gets to you. To get a home run you must hit the baseball correctly, which, depending on your reaction time, can be a piece of cake or a fistful of crap. Much like Wii Tennis, once you hit the ball, all the action on the field is controlled by AI computers. Once again, you can either like this as it seems more relaxed or hate it because it lessens the intensity; it is all just determined on personal preferences. To pitch, you swing the remote and it calls it out as a strike or a ball. Wii BAseball is a great addition, but most players either hate this or love it.Personally, these next two sports are the most boring of the five sports given to you; it might just be my dislike for bowling and golf, but many people do seem to enjoy these. The next sport up is bowling and many people do seem to find this entertaining. Bowling can be played with up to four players. You can position and angle your shot manually. To roll the ball, you swing the Wii remote in an upward motion and let go of the B-Button. It\\'s very simple and almost seems like you\\'re actually in a bowling rink. In golf, you can play it with up to 2 players. You have a choice of a beginner, intermediate or expert 3-hole game, or you can do a 9-hole game. You must input your power and then swing. The motion-sensing is incredible with this one. Golf is the most strategic of all the sports as you cannot hit too hard or too light and you have to take notice of the wind.The last sport, but not least, is boxing. The most interesting aspect of the game is that it is the only one bundled in the game that uses the nunchuk attachment. You hold the Wiimote and nunchuk up and you can do several things involving the motion control. If you tilt left or right, that is where your Mii boxer will tilt. This is used as your basic dodge function. If you hold the remote and nunchuk combo up to your face, then your Mii blocks an attack. You can swing or \"punch\" your nunchuk to punch with your left hand and swing with the Wii remote to punch with your right hand. Sometimes the motion controls can be unresponsive, which can frustrate even the most down-to-Earth gamer. This game is much more fun with multiplayer (like the rest of the games) as you can beat up your friend instead of beating up some chump CPU.It should be noted that Wii Sports is the first game on the Wii that integrates the Miis. These Miis basically set the mood for the look of the game. The backgrounds are very simple and probably overlooked by many people. They are nice, but probably isn\\'t the best thing to look at in the game package. Much like the simple graphics, Wii Sports hold some simple tunes that you either hate, love, or don\\'t even notice. The sound feels crisp and it effectively uses the speakers in the Wii remote. It\\'s not something that is truly memorable, but it seems to fit in with the theme of this game.If you\\'re a fan of sports, I can imagine that you would come back to this game time and time again. If you\\'re a casual gamer, you\\'ll love coming back to this to play with some friends on a Friday afternoon after a dreadful week of school.Though, if you consider yourself a \"hardcore gamer\", you may only see this game as a \"15 minutes of Fame\" game despite being one of the best sports game collection ever.',\n",

       "  'description': ' I’ve never been very good at Jenga. My hands are too big, and they shake a lot. I reach for a piece, and it just topples over. I am pretty good at Boom Blox, though. Boom Blox is a new video game from Electronic Arts and Stephen Spielberg. It’s basically a collection of smaller games where you knock things over, blow things up, and move things around; all while using the Wiimote as your tool. Sometimes you throw a bomb at a bunch of blocks trying to knock gems off of a tower. Sometimes you throw a bowling ball at a bridge, hoping to knock some parts off but not others, and in the game that is the most addictive, you play Jenga. Just don’t call it that, please. The multiplayer games on this disc are just awesome. In the Jenga variation, you have towers of sticks, and you use the Wiimote to grab certain of these sticks and then pull them out of the tower, hoping not to topple it over. If you topple it over, you’ll likely lose. There is this amazing tension when you pull them out, and the not-quite-realistic-but-maybe-it-is-I’m-not-a-physicist-so-I-can’t-be-sure gravity starts moving the tower ever so slightly, and you tense up and hope it doesn’t all fall over. When playing with friends, the trash talking opportunities are countless. There’s also a game where there are towers full of blocks, and some of the blocks are worth points, and others will make you lose points. You take turns throwing a ball at the towers, and trying to knock the point blocks to the ground while keeping the penalty blocks on the tower. This game can get overly lopsided scores in a hurry, so sometimes you’ll want to spend your turn throwing your ball at the annoying block animals that mock you when you do poorly. When you hit them, they flop around and then disappear in very entertaining ways.  Another game is a bit of shuffleboard variant. Each player has blocks of their color, and they are trying to move them along the ice into scoring areas. You throw a ball at your blocks to move them, and you can also try hitting your block into your opponents’ blocks to knock them off the playing field. This game has amazing screw-your-neighbor opportunities, and could start fights in the wrong group. There’s also some shooting games, and some blowing-stuff-up-real-good games, and some games I probably haven’t unlocked yet. All in all, Boom Blox is wicked fun as a multiplayer game. My flatmate and her boyfriend played for 4 hours on consecutive days. They would never admit this, but the Wii is kind enough to email me how often my games are played. (If Wii ever adds an “adult channel,” hopefully this channel won’t report its use.) The single player game is a bit challenging, but bores me to tears. It’s more of a puzzle affair. Once you figure out where to hit the tower or how to pull the sticks, the actual doing of them isn’t too hard. And if I screw it up, which I’m always likely to do, it’s pretty forgiving of errors. It’s a pretty good game to play for someone who sucks at video games, and I’m thankful for that. It was probably made for kids; who knows? I never pay attention to stuff like that. A fun game is a fun game. Go ahead and get Boom Blox for your Wii if you ever have friends come over who are tired of Wii Sports. It’s the next best competitive multiplayer experience going. (Will anything ever be better for parties than Wii Sports Bowling?)  ',\n",

There are radio stations that you can listen to in the vehicles which ive not heard alot of because its been there quiet for me.Graphics:The graphics are decent, there not amazing like other games such as gears of war but its pretty decent. The explosions are nice and character models are well done. But the enviroment isnt amazing its fine but just seems a little grainy. The water looks nice, like when\\xa0 you shoot it.Online:The onlines pretty fun, you chose a character class such as demoltion, which is a very powerfull class to use. theres also a healer type class which drops medi packs for your squad mates, and you can repair damaged ally vehicles. If you kill alot of enimies you get Experiece which will eventually level you up, with that you can unlock new weapons and have a higher role eg sergent commander etc. Theres only one game mode, Gold Rush which is split into two teams, one team must search and destory the opponents gold crates There called the Attackers. The other team is the deffender who must protect the golden crates from oncoming opponents this team is called the deffenders.All in all Battlefield: Bad company Is a great game with a fun story which will last you 10+ Hours, which you may want to complete the story multiple times, going through harder difficulties and searching for golden crates and colletctibles which you might of missed. then theres the online which adds to the fun. Making this a great game and one any FPS fan should buy.*5 STARS OUT OF 5 * Giant Bomb got this one right for sure.Sorry for any typos or any mistakes in a rush hehe\",\n",

       "  'description': '  Nintendo DS Review: Mario Kart DS Besides for Mario\\'s main platforming adventures, the most recent being Super Mario Galaxy, Mario\\'s best sports-take would be his very own racing titles: the Mario Kart franchise. The latest Mario Kart title (not including Mario Kart Wii) is Mario Kart DS, and you guessed it; it\\'s on the Nintendo DS platform. Nintendo does a fine job of bringing their best racing franchise onto another handheld, but how does it compare?When you start the game you will be greeted with a nice picture of Mario... jumping in his Kart (not into his kart, but actually jumping while inside the kart). Anyways, the karts themselves look nice, especially when you\\'re choosing which kart to go into in the Grand Prix mode. You can easily find yourself killing time just to marvel at all the character\\'s specific karts. However, the characters just seems very bulky compared to their rides. Mario\\'s hat should not be so pointy and his fist should not be a square, but what can we expect from the Nintendo DS graphic-wise. Also the big characters, Donkey Kong and Bowser, look rushed and not as polished as the others. In my opinion Yoshi is the best looking character, but that\\'s not important. When you actually start racing though, none of that will matter as both the characters and the kart look very smooth. However, the courses are often very pixelated, whether you\\'re going full speed or just looking around. You shouldn\\'t even be stopping to look at the scenery seeing how it is a racing game.Does anybody remember Super Mario Bros.? Well, the people who composed SMB has also composed for this game as well. Sound is one of Nintendo\\'s specialties right next to gameplay and it doesn\\'t disappoint. The music is elegantly composed. The whole tune, including the menu, has a very Mario Kart-vibe. The music isn\\'t the only great thing about Mario Kart DS, but the overall sound is done quite well. From Mario\\'s \"Here we go!\" to Yoshi\\'s \"Ha-Hoo\", the voice overs are spot on, though we only really hear them when you use or get hit by an item. Speaking of items, their sounds entertain as well. Even the banana\\'s \\'sploot\\' sounds funny. However, my favorite item sound is the blue shell. It sounds like a bomb is about to hit you (and it does). Before it hits you, you can hear the whistling, a sign that it is coming for you and then suddenly an explosion erupts.As far as gameplay goes, it is your standard racing game, with of course the Mario twist. The objective of each race is to finish each course, with a total of three laps, and try to get past the finish line in first place. The thing that separates Mario Kart from all of the other racing games is the idea of items. Within the courses there will usually be more than opportune times to see a floating rainbow box. These rainbow boxes contain one of many different kinds of items. Mario Kart DS also brings some new items to the table such as Bullet Bill and the Octopus\\' Ink Cover. In the Grand Prix mode, you have the choice of choosing 1 of 3 difficulties, 50cc, 100 cc, and 150cc. You can also unlock a 150cc Mirror mode, where all of the courses are flipped horizontally. The Battle mode also makes a return where you control a character and try to pop each player\\'s 3 balloons or stealing them. In battle mode you can also play the Shine Runners, in which you try to collect the most Shine Sprites. After the time runs out the person with the most shine sprites wins. A new feature in Mario Kart DS is the mission mode, where they give you an objective that you must complete. Snaking is also persistent in this this game. Snaking is essentially where you perform drifts to get a turbo. The controls are simple. A to accelerate forward and B to do the reverse. The R button causes you to drift and to snake repeatedly presses Left,Right,Left,Right on the D-Pad and then release the R Button. To use an item press the L button. Very, very simple controls.With this many features, you\\'ll be finding yourself stick your Mario Kart DS cartridge into the DS every now and then. With the four Grand Prix options (50cc, 100cc,150cc, & 150 Mirror cc), the battle modes, and mission modes all in one cartridge you can find yourself playing this by yourself. If you have friends over with a ds and mario kart cartridge of their own, You can race with your friends and battle and everything the single player options let you do (except for Mission Mode). If you friend has a DS, but not a Mario Kart , DS game, you can use the DS download play feature to do the exact same thing that you can do if they do have the game. The only thing that you cant do if you use DS Download play is that anybody who downloads it cannot choose their characters and are automatically Shyguys. Also, Mario Kart DS is the 1st DS game to implement Wi-Fi features so you can battle and race with anybody online. You\\'ll come back to this game over and over again.',\n",

       "  'description': 'An interviewer once asked Producer/Director Hideo Kojima before the premiere of Metal Gear Solid – a decade ago now – if he named the new branch of the Metal Gear lore “Metal Gear Solid” because the protagonist’s name was Solid Snake. Kojima response was, “No, it’s Metal Gear Solid because it’s a ‘solid’ game!” Fortunately, that same cheesy statement applies ten years later to the final chapter of the canon MGS series. MGS4 starts out in the ‘not too distant future’ (a.k.a. 5 years later) with Snake being briefed about his next mission. Snake, being a Foxhound guy, spy, military man, and philanthropist, is now adding hit man to his list. As the story is the bread and butter of Metal Gear’s fame, I will not delve much further into it other than to say that the story in this game is absolutely breathtaking and believable. There are very minor inconsistencies (i.e. certain background characters being female when in previous installments the character was male) but the overall packaging is amazing and this game encompasses all 5 previous installments into the storyline. That said, be prepared that you need 5 games worth of story under your belt or you can get lost really fast in the storyline. It’s rare to find a story with as much depth in video games as the one this series has, so sit down and enjoy the ride. The graphics and sounds are absolutely amazing. To be honest, I’ve never seen a console game look as gorgeous as MGS4 does. Facial expressions, motion captioning, and visual effects in this game have no equal in comparison to any other console game to date. Every nook and cranny has heavy emphasis on presentation, and the seamless transformation from cut-scene to game play will often have you realizing you’re actually controlling Snake again only after a tank rolls over you. The sounds are top notch and have set new standards for future PS3 games to live up to. The narration and voice acting are also at the top of their games and at the top of my mind the only franchise that puts as much into the voice acting as this series is the Legacy of Kain franchise. Henry Gregson Williams certainly earns his keep yet again. The music encompasses past tunes with all new ones to create another score that is truly epic. The story/voice cast/cinematic combination is as strong in this game as it was in the original Metal Gear Solid – a bold statement indeed. The gameplay is utterly outstanding. The developing really took a U.S. perspective on the battle system. The tweaked battle system is leaps and bounds above previous installments. The camera system is much more conducive to shooter style than any previous MGS, you can choose which shoulder you want to look over in third person when your weapon is drawn, you can easily switch to first person shooter with a tap of the triangle, and if knocked on the ground (or otherwise with your back to the ground) you can fire while on the ground. Close Quarters Combat (CQC) allows you many options of dealing with an enemy without gunfire for those who are of the Assassin’s Creed style of playing. Of course, as with any Metal Gear, the core to the gameplay is stealth. Ducking and hiding behind cover does not feel like “oh my god run!” like it used to, instead it feels more like “haha sucker, you can’t see me” like it did in the first MGS. Octocamo in this game is a major improvement over the various camouflage one had to constantly switch through in MGS3 and can be fun to play with. Wearing rebel disguises to fool the guerrillas is also fun to do as well; another option, taking a page out of Mission Impossible, allows you to wear various other faces with the face camo . Getting around unseen is as easy and fun as going Rambo on everything that moves. Of course, a new feature is the Drebin Points system. This feature allows Snake to sell used guns to a man named Drebin for points which can be used to launder guns, purchase ammo and new weapons, or customize and upgrade current weapons. With the sheer amount of weapons and all the customizable options, it’s hard not to have a good time finding the arsenal of weaponry that you simply cannot be on a battlefield without. With that said, the latter half of the game tends to revolve more around the story and cutscenes. Before you start groaning though, realize that you can offset this with the fact that each act has different gameplay emphasis, and during the cutscenes you can play with the Mark II for some gameplay benefits. The game is in no way lacking solid and heavy gameplay. The replayabilty of this game is off the charts. With the previously mentioned weapon customization, variety of ways to play, 40 status emblems to unlock, and introducing Metal Gear Online, you have countless hours that you can plug into the game. Metal Gear Online feels a bit like Call of Duty 4 with the detail of a single player campaign and can bring countless hours of fun into your game – not to mention it has positive effects on the main game itself. MGO is currently in the works to be updated for up to a decade, so don’t expect things to dull out in that department anytime soon. I cannot foresee anyone not playing through the single player campaigns at least twice. I completed the game four times before writing this review. The Breakdown: + Story and voice cast has never been better… period + Both single player and online play is outstanding and top notch + Graphics and visual design are simply amazing and support the full HD range from 480p to 1080p + Many hours of replayability and unlockables + Sounds and music are beautiful and gripping with Surround Sound. +/- The latter half of the game switches from gameplay based to wrapping up the overall story, but there are many ways to enhance gameplay options and is thoroughly balanced out. If this is the bon voyage for one of gaming’s most well-loved characters, it is an absolutely fitting end for the saga and for Solid Snake. This game is undoubtedly in my mind one of the greatest games ever made. Rarely does a game innovate or reinvent its genre, but this game innovates the genre and itself throughout the entire course of the game. The end may have come for the Metal Gear series, but a new era of the overall gaming experience and standards has just been born. Final Score: 5 out of 5',\n",

I mean, the game involves so much blab that at the end of it you\\'re thinking to yourself, \"Ok, what the fuck just happened.\" That\\'s the impression that this \"mission simulation\" left on me, lot\\'s and lot\\'s of nonsensical nonsense. I mean, it really didn\\'t help that I never played the first MGS game, but ah, I got by...with a major headache. All in all in the end I was very impressed by what was my first Playstation 2 game, a game that in essence made me want to continue discovering what this grand system had to offer.The game starts out making sense...basically. OK so you go right, you\\'re styling as Solid Snake ready to kick some ass and get intel on the fucking \"nuculer\" shit before something bad happens. Oh, too late, something bad happens, and now you\\'re some chick named Raiden!! So then as this chick your mission is to basically get to the middle of the hudson in Manhattan, and as polluted as you thought the river already was, now there are friggin nuke shits in a tanker!! But putting all plot aside...this part actually isn\\'t that bad.Now see what you have to understand is...that this game plays like you\\'re being constantly nagged by your mom. Yea...every 5 seconds you\\'re being called about how to do something or where to go and whether or not you remember the first time you met your girlfriend. Sheesh, you could have at least given me the option to turn my phone on vibrate!!...or sumfin\\'. But this isn\\'t all bad, because many of the game\\'s weirdest and most key cinematic moments are triggered by these conversations. And the battles, ha, the strangest and most interesting.Regardless of what you fancy as long as you can take a game with rather slow gameplay to test your patience, you will be rewarded with one of the greatest cinematic experiences anywhere. It\\'s like you paid your cold hard cash in order to see the best action movie ever made. Although I cannot say too much in this review without spoilers, it is true that this is a must play on the Playstation 2. Get past the fact that you\\'re using a chick most of the time. And yes, she is a chick, because when Raiden is naked...she has no balls. Andddddd....cut.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Rockstar brought back Liberty City for Grand Theft Auto IV. This time Liberty City has been changed and made more realistic and more fun for the player. Rockstar has also fixed all of the problems in past GTA IV games, from irritating glitches and the weapon system to make a more rounded game.   This time round we follow Niko Bellic. He has come to the United States to start a new life, a better than the one that he had in the \"old country\" he comes from. He comes on behalf of his cousin, Roman, who tells him stories of his success. Niko finds most of this untrue, but still will try to make a living.  The game begins and plays like any GTA game. You are first driving people around and doing little tasks for people. This task all feel familiar but also new because many of the mechanics of previous games have been re-worked for this game to more enjoyable to play. This first thing you will notice that Niko walks like he would, not just a normal walk. The driving in the game is also different and will take some use to get used too.   Things are also missing or have been taking out of this game that we present most notably in the last GTA game, San Andreas. Plans are not flyable in this game, but helicopters remain for enjoyment and as a way to travel the city. A stats system is no longer in place either. Previously it was necessary to eat food to keep your health up, now it is only needed to regain health. Also changed is that fact you do not need to work out to build strength. Also eliminated is the ability to gain the ability to dual-wield weapons. When it comes to missions the ones available make this game feel and be a GTA game. Some feel new where you will kidnap someone and they will try to wreck the car, and feel more real. In the game there are also the side mission for the police, fire truck, and drug runs. These have been revamped and, in my opinion, present much better. For example the police mission are from the police computer and you can choose which one you want to do and so fourth. Much better than the jump-in and do it style presented in the previous games.  Multi-player is available for you as well. You can jump into a game write from your cell phone in the game. You can play with other people or people from you friends list. No matter how you play it can be really fun. Rockstar did a good job with multi-player.   One of the best part of any GTA game is the free play you can do inside the game. As in the past it is still fun as ever. Getting in trouble with the cops and causing the most destruction you can in Liberty City is great. The affects of explosions and the colors and weather affects are amazing and if you are not careful can distract you. The levels of the available for forces to come after you are different. The military will no longer come after you, just police, but stronger and more dangerous police squads.  The strongest aspect of the game is the story. Rockstar has developed a character that you care about and that shows emotion and that you connect too. In this game, unlike previous ones, you have at some points in the game to affect the story by making a choice. This really intensifies the game because what you do has repercussions on the people around you. Some of these choices are hard to make, some you even have to think about. GTA IV is one of the few games that I felt the story was very compelling and actually playing to complete that story and see what would happen next.   Rockstar was really able to hit home with Grand Theft Auto IV. Fans of the series will see this as Rockstar\\'s greatest achievement ever in the franchise of Grand Theft Auto. People who like to see a good story develop will also see this as a great game, even though it can be very violent. Even after the story there is much to do in Liberty City. There is the multiplayer available and the endless fun available just to bring terror to Liberty City.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Rock Band is developed by Harmonix the guys behind Guitar Hero. This year the guys took it one step forward and introduced not only the guitar, but also drums and singing into the mix. This leads to one of the best family and friends experiences I have ever had playing a video game.   Rock Band\\'s set up is very nice. It is set-up well and plays out well. First lets talk about the instruments themselves. The guitar control, which can also be a bass, is very much the same as the Guitar Hero controller. It has five buttons that are all color coordinated with the button you are supposed to press. The drums work the very much the same way, but you have to hit the drum set according to color as well, and use the foot-petal too. Singing is very much like a karaoke game. The words scroll across and you have to match the pitch. Playing all these together you can become a great band.  Rock Band features two playing modes: a solo tour and Band World Tour. Solo tour is essentially Guitar Hero. You can play this mode with any of the instruments. Solo tour is nice, but you really want to play Rock Band with someone else. Band World Tour is what Rock Band is all about. You and up three other friends can create a band and start touring the world. You each can create a custom character and even name your band. You start out as a little band playing in your home city, which you select. As you play more and more you unlock new cities. Eventually you will be prompted to play in a concert to unlock new traveling means such as a van or bus. This allows to play in even more cities and more places. World Tour does have it\\'s problems. You can not play World Tour online with anyone. A major setback. You also have to move up in difficulty as you progress through World Tour. (Note: As I went through Band World Tour this was still a problem, but I believe a new patch fixed this.)   Rock Band does feature a \"battle mode\" called Tug-of-War, where you can face off against someone playing the same instrument. When doing this you each play a part of song and push each meter down. Once the song is over and the person who has the other person pushed all the way down is the winner. It is an interesting battle thing, but more would be nice.  You can\\'t help but to talk about the track list in Rock Band. Rock Band features a lot of great songs already included with the game. The does feature a in game music store that allows you to buy more songs to play in Rock Band. Many great songs are available for download at reasonable prices.   Fans of Guitar Hero will find themselves at home with this one. But Rock Band does have limitations. As I mentioned no online World Tour is possible at the moment of this review. Rock Band\\'s imitation instruments do have their limitations. The drums do not always respond and the foot petal is frail, so people with lead feet be warned.   These are only minor problems, all of which can be fixed. I recommend this to all. ',\n",

       "  'description': \"  NES Review: Kirby's Adventure I'm sure you've played as Kirby in Super Smash Bros, on the handhelds, and maybe even on the virtual console. But have you played the game that first introduced Kirby on a home console and made the successful Nintendo franchise it is today? That game is Kirby's Adventure on the NES, the second game in the Kirby franchise (Kirby's Dream Land being the first). You can purchase this game for 500 Points on the Wii's Virtual Console, the equivalent of $5 US. It has also been remade on the Game Boy Advance as Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land. Kirby's Adventure is the game that made Kirby's copy ability his main move throughout the next Kirby games to come.The story starts when Kirby wakes up from his sleep without any dreams. Kirby soon discovers that King Dedede has stolen the Star Rod, the Fountain of Dreams' power, and separated them into 7 pieces scattered across 7 different worlds. To get those 7 pieces back, Kirby must venture across those worlds and defeat six bosses that hold the Star Pieces, and then eventually defeat King Dedede who hold the seventh piece. However, when Kirby obtains all 7 star pieces and puts them back together into the Fountain of Dreams, a dark creature named Nightmare appears from the fountain. Kirby then discovers that the Star Rod had been corrupted by Nightmare and King Dedede only broke the pieces for the good of all Dream Land. Kirby must then use the Star Rod to defeat Nightmare and save Dream Land.The thing that separated this game from Kirby's Dream Land was the ability to copy your enemies' powers. Kirby could just suck them up and swallow them to gain the abilities of the monster he consumed. For instance, if he swallowed a fire enemy, Kirby would be able to breathe out fire. If Kirby were to swallow a sword-wielding warrior, Kirby would now be the one with the sword in his hand. You get the point, right? Alongside his copy ability, Kirby can also puff up by inhaling air and inhaling more air, causing him to be able to fly. To release this flight, Kirby can just exhale.Kirby is the basic platformer where you start at Point A and you have to go to Point B. Of course, in Kirby's Adventure going from point to point is as fun as it can get. Eat monsters, use their powers to kill more monsters, take down the occasional boss or two. Kirby's Adventure took everything that was great from Kirby's Dreamland and added the twist of copying abilities, a concept that only Megaman really used at the time. The best thing of the game was its autosave feature. Most NES games used a password system to start at certain points in the game, which, as it sounds, is a boring and tedious chore.For its time period, Kirby's Adventure was one of the best looking games on the NES (probably because it was released towards the end of the NES generation). This is a game that is colorful and fun to look at, while still doing a good job of keeping upbeat and flavorful. The amount of different colors and tones used to bring the scenarios to life is astounding. Some may even say it looks almost like a Super Nintendo game, which I partly agree with: just not as detailed. Kirby's Adventure is basically a journey that has colorful environments, enemies, and levels.Kirby's Adventure holds some of the most catchiest tunes in all of the NES history. Much like its graphics, Kirby's Adventure has many upbeat and light-hearted songs in the bunch. Even when fighting the bosses, it feels as though the song could just be a little too up-tempo. As far as sound goes, it is always happy, no matter what. I just wish they could have given some parts a more darker feel to it, but not too much as it should feel fitting with its level design.The controls are very basic as one button is to jump and another button is to suck. You can press the down on the D-pad to swallow. You use the D-Pad to move and, if you prefer, the up button on the D-Pad to jump. To consecutively fly, repeatedly press your prefered jump button. Simple, very simple.As far as replay value goes, even after you're finished you can go back to previous levels and replay them all you want. Alongside levels, you can also play minigames including a crane pick-up game, a Wild West Shootout, etc. If you want to complete the game 100% I can almost guarantee that you will have to go back to each World at least twice, so if you're a perfectionist gamer go for it, if you're not you may come to this game in a couple of years just to replay some old levels. If you're a new fan of Kirby, buy this on you're Virtual Console. If you have Super Smash Bros. Brawl, check out your 'Masterpieces' section.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"As its name would suggest, Final Fantasy IX is the ninth instalment in the long-running RPG series from Squaresoft (now Square Enix) and the third game in the franchise to find its way onto Sony's PlayStation console. Its older brothers, FFVII and FFVIII, have both prided themselves on exploring new gameplay mechanics (the Materia and Junction systems respectively) and establishing the post-modern, semi-sci-fi RPG. In this respect, FFIX couldn't be further from them. Not only does it adopt the style of presentation from older incarnations, but it also borrows a vast number of old gameplay mechanics too. So, a lame cash-in, you might think. A tired franchise duplicating past games. Well, no, actually. Quite far from it. FFIX isn't a duplicate FF, merely a return to the series' roots.  So what's the story, morning glory? If you don't know it by now, or confuse the plots of different games in the series, or just can't remember, FFIX is the story of bandit/monkey-boy Zidane Tribal. At the start of the game, Zidane and the rest of his daring troupe are posing as actors in a bid to infiltrate Castle Alexandria and kidnap Princess Garnet Til Alexandros XVII. It's the typical, imperially oriented stuff you'd expect from Final Fantasy, at least if you're familiar with the series' origins, and the story that unfolds doesn't disappoint. An international war, a corrupt queen, inanimate Black Mages and powerful Eidolon summoning all follow suit, and that's still only scratching the surface of what FFIX has to offer.  On top of this plot, FFIX builds on the character empathy that's become something of a series hallmark. While the graphical style may be more cartoony and relaxed than FFVIII's gritty realism, all of the characters are believable and have their own personality traits that can be identified with. Of particular interest is the Black Mage Vivi, who has become something of a cult character. His outlook on life and confused nature almost mirror the feelings of uncertainty associated with adolescence. This ability to recognise the emotions of the characters makes FFIX perhaps the most accessible FF to date.  Of course, none of this would matter if FFIX didn't play well. Thankfully that's not a worry. The gameplay is traditional FF-fare, with some aspects clearly recycled from the fabled SNES era of the series, but everything is refined and given a fresh lick of paint. Despite so much being borrowed, the end result doesn't feel like a rehash. It plays like FFIX. As per usual, the gameplay is divided into three core areas: exploration (moving from town to town, on foot or via airship/chocobo), side quests (such as the initially fun but ultimately tedious Tetra Master Card game) and random battles.  FFIX's battle system is perhaps the most refined battle engine of any RPG to date. Yes, the battles are still random, and thus the fans will still be divided, but the level to which FFIX's battles have been detailed is enough to convert the indifferent. Once more harking back to its glory days, the series has returned to allowing four characters to participate in battles. This, coupled with the individual battle styles of each character, makes for highly tactical conflict. In particular, the boss battles require a fair amount of strategic thought to come out on top. This harks back to FFIV, where characters had their own abilities which were beneficial in some areas and hindered in others. The system works really well, and serves as a reason for mashers of the X button to break their ways.  Final Fantasy games have always looked and sounded amazing, pushing consoles to their absolute limits, and FFIX is no exception. Graphically, FFIX surpasses everything before it and just about everything after it. Never has anything on Sony's little grey box looked so phenomenal. The characters are detailed, the environments lush, and the FMV is of the standard we've all come to expect from Square. But where FFIX really shines is in its battles. The gorgeous magic and Eidolon summon spells are delivered at an astonishing frame-rate and you'll never forget the breathtaking showdown between Bahamut and Alexander as the former lays siege to the Alexandrian empire.  The sound doesn't disappoint either. Nobuo Uematsu delivers a thematic and ambitious score that reflects the Elizabethan, industrial empire setting perfectly. The only detrimental thing about FFIX's soundtrack is the superiority of the soundtracks of its SNES inspiration. Put simply, Uematsu-san can't out-compose himself. The music does its job, and it does it very well, but it doesn't change the fact earlier games, and FFVI in particular, have done it better.  In conclusion, FFIX is everything you've loved about the series to date distilled into a single package, without being a clone of its predecessors. As well as paying homage to what has made it what it is, Final Fantasy IX is a stunning RPG in its own right that you'd be mad not to experience. It may not be the best Final Fantasy, but it's the most refined, most accomplished, and most accessible in the series. Play it now.\",\n",

       " {'deck': \"Even some problems can't stop a Bully\",\n",
       "  'description': \"Bully arrived almost two years ago on Sony's PlayStation 2. At that moment we saw Rockstar could make a game that didn't have guns, car driving, or blood. Bully follows the story of Jimmy Hawkins, a teenage boy, left behind at Bullworth Academy as his mother and new step-father drive away for the Honeymoon, which will be a year long. You are now left alone at Bullworth, to make your own path, by fitting into new groups such as the nerds or greasers, go to class, or even get a girlfriend (kissing scenes included.  First off, the game's graphics have been toned up for the Xbox 360 version of Bully: Scholarship Edition. Character's faces appear to have more detail this time around. Even the school and surrounding community has been toned up for Jimmy's Scholarship edition. Note though that the graphics are not something truly amazing. This is not running of what GTA IV is going to run on or even anything impressive we have seen on the Xbox 360.   The story remains the same, but with some new mini games and a Christmas story that was added into this version of Bully. If you played the game before you are going to remember the story, so it could be boring if you play through again. Even so, the story is a good story that give you a chance to experiment with the different groups and pull pranks on all the other students at Bullworth. You have the chance to attend classes at school, such as Gym, Chemistry, Music, Art, Biology, etc. These classes are simple mini-games that you either pass or fail. Passing classes help you unlock new items and such. Classes are only optional, except when you are caught by a prefect during class hours, which you are then forced to attend class.  For being a game about a school you are allowed to leave the school and walk, ride a bike, or skate board around the surrounding community. Bully is a sand box game which give you more freedom. In the community around Bullworth you can get a haircut to customize Jimmy or buy items for your use. In school and around the community you may get side missions by students to escort them somewhere or put something in a locker for them. All these things could possibly get you into trouble with the authorities if caught,.   In Bully: Scholarship Edition one of the games new features is the ability to play with a friend. But not how you would want to play it. You can only play games with the friend, which is fun, but not something that would be fun for a long time. It would have been more interesting to see Rockstar allow co-op play for Bully this time around.  In closing, if you were disappointed to see Bully canceled for the Xbox and never got a PS2 to play it now is your chance, with some new content included. If you did play the PS2 version, buying it again probably isn't worth because the new content is not that great. Also, if you don't like bugs Bully: Scholarship Edition is full of them on the Xbox 360. These bugs can cause your game to freeze and even crash. These bugs can cause you to save a lot and when it happens to become frustrated when it does.  I do recommend Bully: Scholarship Edition, but a buyer beware.  Note: At the time I reviewed the bugs in the 360 version still had not been fixed.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Well as you all know, the hype for this game was INSANE!  Like it was huge! But you cant really trust the hype, like look at Hellgate:London. It got really hyped up and didnt fit expectations. This game, is not like that! It far surpasses the hype!  After waiting like forever and doing beta this is my review for this game:  This game is Revolutionary Amazing!  I was hyped up for this game since early 2006 and expected it to be good but i was extremely surprised.  Here is a brief list of features in this game, reading it isn't as fun as playing it!  Amazing new combat system! Great community! Breathtaking graphics! Remarkable gameplay! Unique classes! Fun quests! Amazing Spells! Awesome Abilities! 3D Environment, Climb, Jump, Swim, etc! Large Selection Of Cool Weapons And Armour! Much Much Much More!  To all potential players remember this:  Need a good PC to run it Not to fun until level 4+ Takes a couple hours to understand  Truth be told when i started it off in early access i was disappointed at start. I didnt really understand everything, and didnt know what to do. I played anyways to give it a chance but then after 20 minutes i started having the time of my life! It was unbelievable!  Features (A Little More In depth):  - Unique fun character classes! You can pick from a barbarian that slashed peoples heads off to a caster who dose unbelievable things!  - Then you customize your chaircter in so many ways it makes it very unique and interesting. There are so many options of customizing every little hair, skin feature, size, tattoos that you will never see a duplicate running around  - Unlike alot of MMOs, when you start its extremely boring. It will take you around 20 minutes to get to level 4 and then you will have a ton of bloody spells, cool weapons and armor and can start playing the game for real!  - Unlike alot of awesome MMOs where you level, you get nothing. After you level 10 levels you unlock one thing. BOOOO. In AOC, every level unlocks cool weapons, armor, spell points and ability points. Most the times you level up you even unlock awesome spells and awesome abilities  - The graphics for this game are just insane, you can relax in your chair and stare at it for hours  - It is an M Game to the majority of the people are adult or late teen. I found that this is one of the best community i have ever met! Very mature people, willing to offer help and be friends.  - AoC Combat......Revolutionary, Amazing, Awesome, Great! Instead of auto-attacking you go up to them and have 3 positions to attack from plus spells that add on to it so you actually hack there head off or hack at them while blood flies everywhere. I cannot describe it with mentioning you must try it out!  - The gameplay in this game never gets boring! You always have a million and one things to do that are very fun, always getting new awesome weapons and armor, talking to fun people and doing fun things!  - The quests are very fun, instead of looking through a big city for a person or having to run around you have to kill alot of cool monsters, beat dungeons, etc.  - The Spells and Abilities are very bloody, beautiful and result in some uber pownage! They cause alot of damage and make blood fly everywhere. You can have 7 spells equipped and change them wherever. They are amazing.  - 3D Environment is purely awesome. Instead of running around you can climb, jump of cliffs and swim! Swimming is quite fun and the jumping/climbing saves alot of time and is fun to do.  - Weapons and Armour in this game are very unique, great looking and pown! You normally upgrade your armor by just killing things and getting great drops instead of boring yourself to death and buying a weapon in alot of MMOs  Much Much More!  I could write a 90000 page review on how awesome this game is but i want 2 get back 2 playing it so i will close with these few statements  - It is an extremely bloody violent game with alot of quests and fun objectives to do. You get alot of awesome armor, weapons and spells for basic gameplay. Money doesn't mean much in this game till you get to a high level so you don't need to worry about boring yourself to death. After lvl 50 you can use mounts and other extremely fun things but you can use more things every level. It is extremely beautiful and fun to play   Overall Statement = Play It!   If you need any help in the game, fell free to contact me, my name in the game is CartmanMy rating scale depends on the platform and genre its on. Since PC has much more awesome games on it, i mark much harder on it so a 80% on PC would mean its great compared to the hundreds of other awesome PC games of that genre, and might be better than a 98% of consoles. A great game is a great game, on the system. I like to keepy my reviews short and sweet, so i wont bore you and get to the point. If theres an official review out on Giant Bomb, you should definately read it because they are the best reviewers in the worlds! =DGameplay 10/10Graphics 10/10Fun 10/10Replay 10/10Single+Multiplayer 10/10Overall =\\xa0 50/50\\xa0 =\\xa0 100% \",\n",

       "  'description': \"Final Fantasy III was the last final fantasy to be released on the super nintendo. Final Fantasy III is an amazing Rpg with a great story and great game play. There are many characters to choose from having in your party. Some of the most interesting parts of the game were when you would have to make multiple parties and they would be in different areas doing things which would affect another party. A lot of fun interactive ideas in the game mixed with great storytelling make this an amazing game. One of the biggest forms of plot/character development is Kefka. This is how you do a villain right. You know him from the beginning and you can actually see him slowly becoming more evil and more crazy over a period of time spanning the whole game. This is where many rpgs go wrong, they make a crazy villain but he comes out of nowhere, with this game you see Kefka all the way through and you can tell he is going to be the main villain right off the bat. The battle system uses the ATB system that final fantasy II did and it worked with that game so why fix it if it isn't broken. All of the party members have an exclusive skill. The character Gau has a skill where he jumps on an enemies back then returns to your party a few battles later with that skill learned. This is similar to how a blue mage functions throughout the job oriented games in the Final Fantasy series. Then there is a character like Sabin who's character specific move is called Blitz. With this command open you press a series of button commands from moves you have learned and with the correct output he will do that move. With all of the characters in the game you may think that it would be hard to be able to have a lengthy plot development surrounding all of the characters but not only does Final Fantasy III do this well I believe that this game is the best game to have done that. With the length of the story and the multiple side quests it is easy to stray away from the main story for a long time and do all of the extra things. Overall this is a great Rpg that nobody should miss or has an excuse to miss because it has already been re released on the Playstation and the Game Boy Advance.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"The Mario Kart series has always been great because of two reasons.    One, is the cool-factor of racing with your favorite Nintendo    characters. Two, because you can have a blast with friends. While these    two things are present in Mario Kart Wii, and in one case improved    upon, it's definitely not the best game in the series.     While playing, I was never feeling like it was a Wii game in itself.    Rather, I felt like I was playing some good old Mario Kart, which isn't    a bad thing, but when the game releases on a system with so much    potential to innovate the series, I feel a little left out. It all    boils down to the controls. With Mario Kart Wii, you can play with five    controller configurations. The game comes with the 'Wii Wheel', a    plastic shell that you can put your Wii remote into, to feel like your    controlling a car. You can choose to just use the remote without the    Wii Wheel, but it's difficult and I found myself playing with one hand.    You can play with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, which is a nice way to    control it, but can end up being frustrating, especially in the 100cc    and 150cc difficulties. The last two options are the GameCube    controller and the Classic controller, which completely defeats the    purpose of it being a Wii game. It seems that the Wii controls fail to    innovate the series, only change it.      The big inclusion in Mario Kart Wii is the motorbikes. Yes, the game    now has motorbikes, which on the surface, sounds really good. The way    the game is set up is that you can play 50cc with Karts only, 100cc    with bikes only, or 150cc with both Karts and bikes. To add, 150cc is    incredibly difficult, especially if you are new to the series. The    bikes themselves are pretty cool, as you can go off of jumps and    perform aerial tricks. Also included in the game is the ability to now    go online and race people around the world. Up to 12 players can battle    it out, and the service is undoubtedly the best the Wii currently has    to offer, which is unfortunately limited to begin with. You can install    the Mario Kart Wii Channel, which gives you leaderboards and other    features. You can also save time trails and participate in    Nintendo-supported tournaments. From what I've played, it has no lag    and finds opponents quick, and voting for maps is cool.      Mario Kart Wii seems like a mediocre effort overall, unfortunately. The    character animations are horrible in relation to what we've seen on the    Wii already, and the Battle mode is kind of clueless, as it's just way    too easy. Nintendo appears to want to appeal to a bigger audience this    time around, which is good, but sacrificing any innovation makes Mario    Kart Wii feel like another lap on the same race track. What is good is    that not only does it have new tracks, which are fun and challenging in    higher difficulties, but it also includes SNES, N64, DS, and GBA stages    as well, which brings back the days I remember, although the game was    feeling nostalgic even without the retro tracks, and with the retro    tracks included, it feels more like a past game rather than a brief    blast to the past.      Wii's Mario Kart outing is a good game, although it feels stuck in the    past and a little boring. Still, if you've got three buddies around and    are looking for a good game to play together, you can't go wrong with    Mario Kart Wii. Just don't expect it to Wow you like Super Mario Galaxy    or Super Smash Bros. Brawl.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"My relationship with Dragonball games has been a very mixed one. Some I loved and some i hated. This is kind of in the middle. For the msot part its still keeps DBZ feel which I guess you could say is really all it needs to do. On the other hand you wonder if they been a little lazy as well.  Burst Limit takes dragonball back to Budokai routes, This is pretty much that kind of game. If you played dragonball game before then you may already know what to expect. Its simple controls with some powerful beam attacks and that has always and may always be the case. Its also has a few more harder mode of diffculty which is also a nice change so you may not always be running rings around the dude your smacking. There also the modes you expect story, vs, practice , ect. The finally big thing you see is the Drama pieces.   These add the talking parts and such of dbz and also give bonus like increase in somthing or even health increase. Some are kind of long and most get boring after a few times of seeing them but the bets thing is when they chat with each other. You might get two people you u never expect like if your Goku and you have Raditzas a drama Piece, he will shout at you saying somthing like you suck goku, or need a hand and goku will say somthing like shut up. This does'nt work for all char thought.  The graphics are pretty nice but a lot of is just all flash, at the end of the day thought thats what dbz has always been about. pretty attack ect. I mean there not ground breaking but they do look nice. One thing I really like is some of the in game moments, Take the fight in story made betweebngoku and Nappa. They put the famous Its over 9000!!! part in they and its pretty much just as funny watching it on there as in the anime.   The sound is kinda of ok. The intro song is one of the best yet but its the voice acting that really let it down. A lot of it just sounds really poor and hollow but some of it sounds really good to.   I think what let the game down most more then anything is its lack of content compared to the other games. I'm not talking about adding 400 char or so but it would of been nice to a see a few more people in the game like cooler ect. But they even miss out the Cell Jr which paly a pretty big role in the Cell Games. I would of loved to of see them add just a bit more but i guess they saving that stuff for the 2rd game which kind of sucks but hey. But they is a good number of char and such in the end. They was really 1 what if story in brust limit Involing Bardock but it has been by the bar the best What If I've seen yet which was nice.  Brust Limit won't be for everyone but thats ok cause its not made for everyone. Its there for Dbz fans and for people wanting to know more about the show. I still recommend even if you are'nt a fan to at least try it. It may not be best game they put out but its by far not the worst either.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Tom Clancy has a long running history of being one of the best writers when it comes to war and different sections of the Military. It would seem odd then, that one of the best game franchises ever, used the name Tom Clancy, yet was the only game to have a book written after the game, not the other way around. Splinter cell has had three great games, each one having its own unique feel and level design, it really has immersed you into the game of espionage and stealth. The latest offering from Sam fisher comes in the form of Splinter Cell: Double Agent, and it doesn't disappoint. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It’s been a while for Sam. After saving the world yet again, and swimming up several hundred feet from an underground facility, Sam started training the new generation of super spy. That’s when things started to go downhill. His daughter is suddenly killed in a car accident, and an assignment in Russia gone terribly wrong leaves everyone Sam loves dead. That’s when Lambert approaches Sam about a new mission, the most difficult and daring mission he's ever undertaken: go to jail, befriend a man connected to a terrorist organization, and break him and yourself out of jail.  \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The game plays just like the other splinter cell, sharing more closely to chaos theory than any other game in the series. The story is not very long; you could probably play through it in eight to ten hours, faster if you know what you're doing. Still, this game has plenty to offer. The game is based around the decisions you make. For instance, one of the early levels depends on you shooting a captured man. He's innocent of all crimes, yet the terrorist organization gives you a weapon and demands you pull the trigger. You have trust meters for both the JBA (the terrorist organization) and the splinter cell team. Depending on your decisions you will either gain or lose trust on either team. It's pretty easy to keep in good graces with both factions on normal, and still isn't incredibly difficult under hard. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The game's sound is great. The attention to detail for the sounds of the floor squeaking to the fireworks in Japan to the cloth that is blown in the wind is great. I would have enjoyed more voice acting from the captured foes, since in Chaos Theory nearly everyone you met had something to say, whether worthwhile or not. Still, the main voices are strong and really helps immerse you in the game. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The graphics are simply beautiful. Some of the levels look like they may have had a few parts of the textured borrowed from Chaos Theory, but the new attention to Sam's facial expressions down to the bead of sweat running down his face, this game really helps make Sam's adventure come to life. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The Multi-player in this game is fantastic. The game is pretty straightforward. You have two teams: The spies, which need to download a file and get back to base, and the soldiers, who need to stop said spies. The balance is worked out very well and it really just is a fun experience over Xbox live as well as system link if you can get enough 360's and copies to fill each. The only disappointment in the multi-player is the co-operative missions. Chaos Theory had three strong levels that really were a lot of fun if you had a friend that wanted to play along. There is a co-operative mission for Double Agent, but it is the same scenario as the basic multi-player, just both players are on the same faction. Still Multiplayer shines through as one of the best multiplayer games I've played on the 360. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Overall this game is a great experience if you played the games previously. The game flows great and is an enjoyable experience. If you have never played a splinter cell game before, and enjoy a good action game, this would be right up your alley.\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'Rapture will grab hold of you and never let go.',\n",
       "  'description': 'As game technology increases by leaps and bounds every generation, the hardware has become more and more capable of delivering incredibly cinematic and emotional experiences, which are the best examples of videogames being art. It’s the late 1960s, and main character Jack is on a flight crossing the . The plane soon comes into contact with severe turbulence, and crashes into the sea. Quickly surfacing, Jack swims to a lighthouse, which is found empty and abandoned apart from a bathysphere, which upon entering, descends into the world of Rapture. Rapture was built in the mid-40s by Andrew Ryan, an idealist who felt chained by every form of government, so took it upon himself to build a city free from rules, religion and scientific ethics. The product of such utopian desires is a city which has destroyed itself through genetic engineering, and the once prosperous and intelligent inhabitants of Rapture have turned into vicious and mindless “Splicers” who are in constant need of the genetic material “ADAM”, which maintains their unnatural evolution.  ADAM is harvested from Little Sisters, small girls whose only purpose in life is to recycle ADAM. They are protected by Bioshock’s mascot, the Big Daddies. These lumbering, mechanical beasts protect the Little Sisters, and are the closest the game sees to a regular boss fight. The Little Sisters bring up Bioshock’s major moral dilemma, on whether to harvest them for ADAM, or save them from their torturous existences. Either choice delivers a different ending, and the endings are so polarized between good and evil that you’re either a saint throughout, or a Nazi, which distorts the game’s ambitions of being truly non linear when dealing with the outcomes to the decisions made throughout the game. The rest of the world is portrayed through ghostly projections and voice recordings left by the inhabitants before they met their doomed fate. This helps to amplify the sense of isolation, as the only way the player is ever exposed to the story is at arms length, forcing the player to be an outsider always looking inwards.  From the get go, the world of Rapture feels 100% organic. While so many other First Person Shooters are simply continuous corridors, Rapture feels as if it wasn’t designed for a game, and was designed to be a city. While there are numerous districts to Rapture, the ones that truly stand out are; “”- the entertainment district, and the “Farmer’s Market”, due to their inspired design and interesting architectural pieces. On a technical basis, Bioshock looks excellent, with gorgeous water and fire effects, and a smooth frame rate even in the most hectic of situations.  Rapture is given a harrowing suspense by the “Splicers”, who stalk their prey throughout Rapture, breathing down your neck, whispering their depravities into your ear. The voice acting for all the relatively “normal” characters is spot on, nailing accents and dialects perfectly, helping to reinforce the international feel of Rapture’s populous. Of course, a perfect game world would be worthless without strong gameplay to back it all up, and Bioshock has that side covered perfectly.  Bioshock contains the usual array of firearms, but throughout the game, as with all the other facets of the game, they evolve as you progress. You will soon find Upgrade booths which dish out Steam-punk looking improvements for all your firearms, and these will improve various aspects of each weapon. More interestingly however is the Plasmids, which are interchangeable abilities which allow you to shoot fire, ice, electricity or bees, or you could use telekinesis to throw grenades right back, or turn your enemies against each other. The range of Plasmids is great, and how they can be used to manipulate combat situations is truly breathtaking, and keeps the game from becoming monotonous. The game also has a couple of minigames running throughout the game. \\xa0 Firstly, you’re able to hack turrets to fight alongside you, or vending machines to receive items for a lower price. Secondly, you are a given a camera a little way into the game, and you can increase your advantages over enemies by taking photos and “researching” them. These little facets, while being meaningless in the grand scheme, help to create a more realistic world, and shapes Rapture into something more recognizable.  Bioshock is quite a different beast from most other recent First Person Shooters, as there is absolutely no online multiplayer, and the focus is most definitely on a narrative driven single player experience. It should take most players around 15 hours to get through, but because the world of Rapture is so immersive, it’s easily conceivable to see yourself becoming lost in Rapture for hours.  Closing comments: Bioshock is more than just a videogame. It acts as the final stepping point to videogames finally being considered art, as you’ll leave Bioshock thinking differently, and in that very way, it must be considered art. ',\n",

       "  'description': \"In the Year 4 after World of Warcraft, the online community is still waiting for a game to break WoW's dominance. On the first look Age of Conan seems to be a promising contestant: It combines great graphics, a slightly action-oriented Gameplay and a more mature backdrop, that should differ enough to attract those players, that either never got into WoW or are already bored of it.\\xa0 The question is if it will be able to deliver on this promise.On the technical side, there isn't much to complain. While the graphics aren't revolutionary, compared to other online RPGs, in particular Lord of the Rings Online, Age of Conan is probably the best looking. A victory at the price that low spec machines have to reduce details massivly.\\xa0 Recently developers explicitly stated that they want to improve the performance on low spec machines, so there is hope for those of us who have a PC that is older than a year. The sound is in so far outstanding that Funcom walked the extra mile by recording the voice for the characters you meet in your initial quests, which is a nice touch that sadly ends after you finished the single player missions.This is probably the single biggest feature Conan adds to the average MMORPG, instead of giving you normal quests to introduce you to the game mechanics, there is a single player mode. Basically these are just special instanced areas that you can activate by talking to certain characters, but they enfold a small story that you can follow up on later in the game and give you a chance to play even when none of your friends are online. While this makes the early game much more enjoyable,\\xa0 you will probably see the end of it after 4 or 5 hours, depending on the amount of normal questing you do.Another advertized feature was the fast paced combat and Conan actually delivers on this. Instead of just hammering on your mouse or keyboard, there is a slight level of strategy and action, as you can chose from which side to attack your oponent. Later on you can even execute combos that require you to combine certain directions which plays a bit like a very simple rhythm game. Very simple as it is only a few keypresses. That said, the actual way the combat plays doesn't differ from any similar game.Sadly the same holds for the quests, while one can feel the intend to avoid too much grinding, it appears that this has become a core mechanic that no game can live without. While this is probably what everybody expects, there are quite some rough edges. Group quests are not really rewarding for groups, while trying to perform them alone (even if far above the expected level) is impossible. Not because the AI would be very good in these quests, but simply because it has a multiple of health points than any similar enemy. So you can be bored because you have to play these multiple times as a group or fail badly if you try them alone. Even worse some quests are down right broken, suffer from a bad friendly AI or some enemies have much too long respawn times.Especially clans were looking forward to Conan because of its promise to support building up guild towns and raiding other guildss town. While this is already implemented, Funcom announced a massive patch for the PvP component, as it is still rough. If your main interest is PvP, you should probably wait a bit or level up in the meantime. Similar problematic is the job system. While it is possible to have a profession, their usefulness is still limited at the moment. While devs intend to work on this, there is no schedule yet for an upcoming patch.The single biggest motiviation to play AoC is the mature theme, there is plenty of gore and in total the world is darker than most RPGs and capture the spirit of the Conan stories perfectly. As the game got a mature rating in most of Europe at least those servers appear to have a better crowd than I personally encountered in other online games. Speaking of the following - luckily Funcom was more successful with Conan than Anarchy Online, servers seem to be well populated all around the clock and there is always enough players to join up for quests.All in all it is hard to jude an MMORPG, as all of them get refined over time. Anything said above might be outdated in half a year and until now we haven't even seen a single content update, that would extend the end game. As it stands at the moment, AoC is a good game, that has already been refined after a little bit rocky start. The progress has been noticiable, which should make fans hopeful that Funcom will be capable of keeping them entertained in the future. In the end, if you like games to have a more mature topic and MMORPGs, you can't do anything wrong. The 40 hours I spent in Hyboria were so pleasant, that I for my side changed by payment option to half yearly. The promise for still being a great game then is there, and babarian's wouldn't break their promise, would they?\",\n",

       "  'description': \"This game is really good. Infact, I would say its quality is the same as World of Warcraft. And I have played World of Warcraft for 3 years. Now I've moved on to find another game, and this seems to be the perfect antidote for my World of Warcraft addiction. But I think that antidote has a side effect. It makes me addicted to Lord of the Rings Online. And its because of all the cool things about this game:Graphics: I mean, this has to be the prettiest MMORPG out there. Only 1 game can top it. Everquest II. But still, the graphics are awesome. I have a bad computer at the moment when I am writing this review, everything on low. But still, it looks great. My friend has an awesome computer. He plays too and it looks great! Seriously, the water is like it was motion captured, which isn't possible, but it looks like the water in Crysis. Its awesome and the details of grass, trees etc are crazy. The graphics are awesome, even though its an MMORPG. I gotta say the graphics are good.Sound: The sound in this game came be a little annoying at times, but generally, its good. The things I do not like is that sometimes when you speak to people,\\xa0 its bad voice acting and the lines can be annoying too. But if you overlook the bad voice acting, the game then is fair enough, when you hit something with an axe, it makes a sound, if you hit with a sword, another sound so its got variety too. Overall, good sounds.Gameplay: This is the games strong point. God I love this. Of course, you go around talk to people, they give you a quest, go kill something, or go talk to someone, or collect something. Its like a standard MMORPG, but the rewards and variety of the quests are awesome. So you never do something over at over again. Its great. And the social features of the game is GODLY. I mean, you can buy a lute, or horn, or harp, or, you name it and then you play music with it. Fun ! Then you can also get your own house, and a kinship house for your kinship (kinship = guild) if you want it to have parties or just for extra storage. Or you can find a big mountain, jump down from it and break your leg with a friend or two. Its great fun! This is awesome, you can spend hours just breaking legs, playing music, using emotes to talk to people for fun. Good!Overall, this game is good. Its very good. I would recommend it to anyone who likes social stuff and doing epic quests!Graphics: 4.5Sound: 4Gameplay: 5Overall: 4.5-Orakk\",\n",

       "  'description': '*Please note that this review was made to encompass both Seasons AND Ages, and I will post this on both game\\'s pages*Game Review: Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons/AgesThe Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons/ Ages, released May 14, 2001 for the Gameboy Color, are the only two games ( Or at least that I know of ) that are not developed first-party by Nintendo. They are instead developed by a company called Flagship. While this might seem like a death sentence especially considering the popularity and renown of this beloved series, Flagship made a fantastic game worthy of every praise given to the first-party developed Zelda games.This review is technically covering two different games, but both of them are related. The first is Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons. The second one is Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages.These two games have mildly related story-lines but you don\\'t need to play both to have a great time ( The only real payment for having both games is being able to unlock some things like the Big-goron sword and battle with Ganon ).First, story. The game has a typical Zelda story making you go out and vanquish various evil beings residing in dungeons. If you have played a Zelda game before you will know what to expect. Not to say that it is bad, on the contrary it is very good and captivating and is better than the story in most other games but a Zelda fan will know that the story isn\\'t the main attraction.The gameplay is simply fantastic. You control link from a top-down perspective and the controls are like those in Legend of Zelda: Link\\'s Awakening. The controls are very intuitive and you won\\'t find any problems here.The enemies you face are also great. You have your old enemies, such as the octorok and others accompanying you to either Holodrum or Labrynna and all of those scary bosses and mini-bosses. They are all very imaginative and many have special little quirks to them that make them unique. The enemies also seem quite well animated considering this is a Gameboy Color game.The environments you travel around are also phenomenal. From the Maku Tree all the way to the depths of Subrosia I was captivated by the places I was traveling around in this game. The music accompanying these environments is also top notch. Of course the music in all the Zelda games has been great and this one is no exception.The items Link gets are fantastic. They include things like the master sword and go all the way down to items like \"Stinky Bag\" which is given to you by an odd long white hand which seems to be stretching out of a toilet ( Gross eh? ). All the classics are here such as the sword\\'s and shields, but some others for instance the Rod of Season\\'s and the Harp of Age\\'s make their appearance as wellThe Rod of Season\\'s (Only in the Seasons game) and the Harp of Age\\'s (Only in the Ages game) are two items that are really quite interesting and fun to use. The way the Rod of Season\\'s works is you stand on a tree stump and swing it, which changes the season. This is involved in many puzzles and such in the game and really is a joy to use. The Harp of Age\\'s fills the same role by initially allowing you to open up time portals scattered around Labrynna but eventually is capable of simply going through time and plunking you down right were you were either in the future or in the past just by playing it.Both of the items are great and are part of what gives this Zelda game it\\'s particularly epic feel.The graphics are rather irrelevant at this point being that it is a Gameboy Color game but I will say that considering when it was made it looks quite nice. The characters and such all have a charm to them that really enforces the atmosphere in the game.I\\'ve already talked about the music but I\\'ll just say that the sound effects are also good, and won\\'t leave you desiring more.And of course no Zelda game is complete without good dungeons, and this game has them aplenty. Every dungeon is jam packed with keys, enemies, mini-bosses, and puzzles. They will all take a fair amount of time to complete as well, making the game quite long in my opinion. The atmosphere is once again great in the dungeonsAlso, boss fights. They are great as always. All the bosses have fun and unique weaknesses which you can exploit to your advantage, giving all the battles sort of a frantic puzzle feel to them. Top regards to the boss fights.Also, both the games are completely different. They are two completely different games with different story-lines, so I really urge you to get both so that you can get the most out of these masterpieces. As when you have both you can fight Ganon and such, which is always a treat.As for one of the games being better than the other, they are both equal. Although I will say I\\'m leaning towards ages slightly, just as a personal preference. Buy them both, I urge you.Is this game fun to play? Yes, yes and yes. It is one of the best games I\\'ve played in my life and I hope you buy it and see why. It\\'s time to dig out that Gameboy Color or Game Boy Advance and wipe the dust off of it, because you are in for a treat!I rate this game a perfect 10/10',\n",

       "  'description': 'I remember when I was but a wee lad, back when I couldn\\'t afford a single piece of cartridge for Nintendo\\'s electronical videogame machinery due to my moneylessness. So I used to leech off of those who could. One beautiful day when the birds were chirping and the sun had come up from bottom of ground, I got to borrow this thing called Street Gangs, which was its European title.What I was presented with was a story about blablablah. To remedy the situation you punched, kicked, threw and hit dudes with tires, knuckle dusters and whatever else was lying around until they yelled \"BARF!\" and were transformed into bouncing coins. The sensation of hitting dudes with whatever hit me in the face like a trash can, it was pure magic. Also had RPG elements to it where you could buy new moves and upgrade your stats, a concept my still developing brain never fully grasped. But it\\'s a thoroughly hyper-enjoyable experience no matter how you play it. Co-op, as always, would be the preferable way though. If I remember correctly you could pick up your friend and hit dudes with him. Best side-scrolling beat em up ever.',\n",

       "  'description': 'A third person acting fighting game set on the PC and controlled with the keyboard? There is no way in hell that it would work, well, Devil May Cry 4 not only proves a fighting game can work on the PC, it shows that when time and effort are put into the title the end product can be on the better PC games of the year.   Devil May Cry 4 is a gorgeous game, with a plethora of in-game options to customize the graphics to run at an acceptable frame rate on your computer. From Cathedrals to Castles the imagery is truly stunning, water effects are brilliant and show that the Pc is truly the graphics powerhouse in today\\'s console generation. Having played both the Xbox 360 and Pc version I can definitively say the Pc not only looks better but plays better, throughout the entire game my frame rate never fell below 60 FPS which is an astounding accomplishment. DMC4 allows the player to choose between playing with Direct X 9 or 10 graphics depending on the operating system.   What truly makes a game great though is the actual game play and DMC4 is no slouch in this regard. Players control the new hero, Nero in his quest to apprehend Dante who must answers for his crimes. Nero is a complete badass, I mean first off he carries a huge sword and every guy wants the main character to have a huge sword and the sword isn\\'t the best part. His right arm is called the \"Devil Bringer\" and can be used to attack or grab enemies and then thoroughly punish them. The combat is deeply satisfying and brutal. While the pace is slower than that of Ninja Gaiden 2, it is fast enough to keep you entertained and the enemies give a strategic challenge where you cannot spam a single attack and hope to come out on top.   Capcom took its time with this Pc port and spent plenty of time trying to figure out a control scheme that not only worked but was simple as well. Character movement is controlled with WASD keys and different attacks are controlled with IJKL keys. The space key is used to target an enemy and by combining the WASD with IJKL combos can easily be pulled off. While I wasn\\'t able to play it with the help of a 360 controller like many people have suggested, my experience of the game wasn\\'t diminished in any regard and in fact I felt like I was in more control of the combat using the keyboard. The single complaint I have for the control scheme is you cannot use the mouse in any way to handle the camera. At times the camera will be looking at your face while running towards the camera which prevents the player from seeing what lies ahead. While this doesn\\'t detract heavily from the overall experience it is a minor nuisance that may annoy some players.  Devil May Cry 4 isn\\'t a typical Pc port, it is its own version complete with new features excluded from the console versions. While it may not reach the same level of publicity as the console version it may very well carve out its own niche audience who are very happy with the latest version. Pc gamers should definitely give Devil May Cry 4 a shot as it is one of the best Pc titles this year.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Pros      * Graphically and aurally outstanding.     * Engaging story and characters that you'll actually care about.     * Improved combat and driving.     * Still as funny as ever.     * Terrific multiplayer.  Cons      * More radio stations, but what feels like less music in them.     * Customization buffs will feel disapointed given the decrease in options from San Andreas to GTA 4.     * Minigames (Drinking, Darts etc) aren't available in multiplayer freeroam.     * No System Link   It's been around seven years since GTA3 came out and spawned two successful pseudo-sequels in the form of Vice City and San Andreas. And of course after GTA3 and Vice City spawned further spin offs in the form of Liberty City and Vice City stories.  GTA3 represents a high point in gaming that many have attempted to emulate and clone. Some with a good amount of success (Saints Row) and a tonne of others we'd probably rather forget. (True Crime series)  And now GTA4 is out the door and the cycle starts anew. GTA4 isn't the revolution that GTA3 was, but an evolution. And it improves on all the right things and from that we can no doubt see a new wave of imitators.    The game stars Niko Bellic, a Serbian Veteran of the Bosnian War who moves to America after hearing from his cousin, Roman, how great it is there. In his letters, e-mails etc Roman speaks of his mansion, gorgeous women and loads of cash. When Niko arrives he finds the truth to be severely stretched. But he makes do being that there are other reasons he decided to leave his homeland.  The game takes place in a re-imagined Liberty City, the city most will be familiar with due to GTA3. And Liberty City has never looked so good. Pretty much everything in the game looks good, really. With the possible exception of some of the plant life, which can still look a little bit cardboard cutout but it's less noticeable this time around. Theres a lot of details that'll catch your eye.  When it rains, the road will noticeably wetten - become slick. Walk through the rain and your heels will kick up tiny splashes wherever you go.  Car damage seems better modelled then ever. Not quite to Burnout extremes or anything like that, but it's a tonne more noticeable. Tires burst after being shot a bit. Headlines smash, possibly leaving you in the dark.  Neon Lights have never looked so good as they have in this game.  Thats not all.  Random passers by on the street seem more full of life then ever. Pulling out umbrellas or running to shelter if it's raining. Sweeping up the sidewalk. You've got buskers playing for money. Hobos going on insane rants. Everyone has something to say.  Offline and off.  GTA4 adds an interesting Internet component which works as a driving force behind some missions. Some of the news sites also add something of a followup to some of the missions you might've done, commentating on whoever you might've killed - whatever you might've blown up and so on and so forth.  A good amount of the sites there are only there to serve as humor fodder, which is great too. It wouldn't be GTA without a healthy dose of satire - most of which is found via Internet, radio or TV. While the humors still there, this iteration of GTA is somewhat darker and more serious, probably to go with the fact that it's the most realistic GTA yet, I s'pose. Some will like it, some will hate it. I'm all for it. Theres enough humor in the game that it isn't constantly depressing and there will be parts in this game you find depressing.  The game forces a lot of tough choices on you and whilst the changes that come from the choices are - usually - subtle, you'll care a great deal regardless when you have to make them - because they'll effect characters you'll care about. Not many games have characters you'll care about, but with GTA4 it's hard not too. Pretty much all the characters have a certain charm, which'll make some decisions harder then most. But be assured that no matter what decisions you make and who it effects - the games ending is fundamentally the same.  Lets talk about game play.  GTA4's gunplay has been vastly improved. It adopts a kind of Gears of War cover system where you can slide too and stick behind most objects, allowing you to peek out and take shots or just blindly fire. And contrary to what some reviews have said, cover is something you'll want to use. Body armor or no, I've personally found that being in the open with a sufficient amount of folk taking shots at you is a pretty good way to die - I've read quite a few reviews that have said you could go Rambo on every ones ass, but it seldom works out that way.    The game still uses a lock on system and as such you'll still occasionally lock on to someone you didn't mean to lock on too, but the games better now at picking the most immediate threat. You can free aim by just holding the L-trigger down slightly as opposed to all the way, but I personally don't find it to be especially accurate. Good for shooting out tires - vehicles in general - larger targets, not so great against individuals.  It also has an improved melee combat system, but honestly aside from the tutorial where it teaches you, well you'll probably never use it. As neat as it is it's generally just easier to shoot dudes in the head, even when in close range. It's why god invented the shotgun, right? Heh.  Vehicles feel heavier then they used too, which I guess is more realistic, but it'll probably take some getting used too. I had to play a few hours before I came to terms with it, but it ought not be too much of a hassle. I've heard a lot of commentary on the vehicles supposedly lack of speed and I just gotta ask if they're playing some alternate version of GTA4 that I'm not, because whilst the cars are heavier as I said and probably feel somewhat slower then they used too they can still go pretty damn fast and render pretty much everything around you a literal blur.  So GTA4's the first game in the series to have a proper multi player component. Obviously I'm not including the mods applied to the PC version or that cruddy same-screen schtick they pulled in San Andreas.  And the multi player works pretty well. Theres a good variety of game modes, though it's often equally fun to simply tear up Liberty City in free roam. With my shocking connection I'm quite surprised I can play the damn thing and suffer very minimal amounts of lag. I don't get how i can play a deliberately paced game like Rainbow Six Vegas, with nowhere near as much going on in a game and lag like hell but GTA4 - with it's numerous car chases, explosions, shootouts - all happening within a huge city, well I can have no noticeable lag sometimes. But I digress.  In multi player you get to customize your character, but no a terrific deal. You choose your gender, pick from a small pool of a few different faces and clothing and thats it. Playing in ranked matches unlocks more clothing, but thats the extent of character customization.  Speaking of which theres a small amount within the single player game too. Theres around three different clothing stores you can go too, but theres not an awful lot that in my opinion actually looks good so I oft find myself alternating between the default clothing with the addition of an army hat and a classy suit. If you were looking forward to San Andreas amounts of customization you'll be disappointed, unless you're waiting on the inevitable PC version in which no doubt extra clothing will be modded in.  Well lets get to wrapping this up.  Graphically the game is pretty superb. The environments look great, with the exception of some plant life. Even the citizens of liberty city look like more fully realized characters. Explosions are also immensely satisfying to look at. Best explosions I've seen in a while.  Aurally the game holds up well, largely thanks to it's terrific voice acting cast. If any character annoys you, it won't be because of voice acting for once. The sounds of city life are faithfully recreated. Theres 18 radio stations, I think the most in a GTA game yet. Though to be frank, whilst the music in said stations are good I think you'll find the music looping more noticeably then before because I don't think theres quite as much in each station as there used to be. I think I'd have preferred fewer stations with more music as opposed to more stations that have less music, but all the same what music is there is good and if nothing else the extra stations offer a little bit of variety.  I've pretty much already been over the game play. It's fantastic. Combats improved, drivings improved, the mini-games have improved, the dating component has been improved. Improvements across the board. And the action translates well into a multi player environment.  If you're a GTA fan this game is a no-brainer but I think theres enough overhauled that if previous GTA games weren't up your alley then you should still try it.\",\n",

Please note that this Review contanes no spoilers and preaty much no mention of the story in it's curent state.   The Good: Verry fast verry fun , only $12.00 , Top notch sound and art desine   The Bad: Should have been $10.00 Short as Hell the 2 player is throw away        Sin and Punishment: Inherit the earth is a Virtual Console N64 game for the Nintendo Wii that was released on October 1st 2007.  Please note that this Review contains no spoilers and pretty much no mention of the story in it's current state.  Sin and Punishment never came out in the states for undisclosed reasons and being a Japanese game it costs 1,200 Wii points($12) instead of the normal 1,000 points ($10). The price increce is kind of a Rip-Off because the only translated part is the tutorial because the original voice work was in English ( and good English at that )  Now on to the actual gameplay ( for the entirety of this review when I mention the controls I will refer to the Game Cube controller because I don't own a classic controller ) Sin and Punishment is played on rails with the player controlling left and right movement jumping aiming and shooting. you strafe with the Y and X buttons, Y is left and X is right you can also y or x twice to dash in their respective direction ( you can also move with the D-Pad ) you use the R or Z buttons to jump and double jump. You aim with the analog stick or C Stick and shoot with the L button and when enemies or certain projectiles get close you can tap the L button to use a sword swing.  The Sound in Sin and Punishment is top notch. All the sound effects are peaty cool and the music is great and fits the levels perfectly the only problem in the the voice acting is so-so   Graphically you can't expect much from Sin and Punishment since it is a N64 game that came out in 2000 by by those standards it is a great looking game.   Sin and Punishment is very hard especially in the second half of the game on hard. Enemies are constantly coming at you and that's a good thing. The main baddies you will be facing are the monsters known as Ruffians ( yes Ruffians ) and the military group tasked with killing the Ruffians the armed vointeers ( yes you read that part right )  My only major gripe with Sin and Punishment is that it is SUPER short. to get through it once will take a bout an hour but if you obsess with things like maxing out your high score or beating the game with out dying Sin and Punishment can last you many many more hours.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Advent Rising is the first and last game from developer GlyphX Games. A.R. is a third person action game that takes place in the many years in the future where two races of aliens have their complete attentions on humans, one helping and one hurting. One human, Giddeon Wyeth is the only one who can save the future. The story is written by famous sci-fi author Orson Scott Card. Just to say it is really good.The gameplay in Advent Rising is great. There is a flick targeting system similar to the system in Drake and the 99 Dragons except much better. All you have to do to change targets is flick the right thumbstick in the direction of the enemy you want to shoot. People say that its a nuisance when you are trying to run away because it always targets the nearest enemy/liftable item, but it is simply solved if you click the right thumbstick.You get some regular guns, and some pretty cool alien ones also. About one fourth of the way through the game, you start to get some psychic powers. Once you get the powers, you never has to use guns for the rest of the game, if you do not want to. The gameplay overall is extremely fun.The graphics can be spotty sometimes. The characters look pretty good. For some reason, everyone's legs take up two-thirds of their bodies. It is kind of strange, but I like it. The powers and guns look good with the best looking power being the alternate fire of the power Aeon Pulse. Framerate can be a problem sometimes. It dropped down into the single digits when there were large explosions with bodies flying everywhere. Strangely though, it only happened two or three times throughout the entire game. Overall the graphics are passable.The music in this game is breathtaking. Beautiful orchestral tracks throughout the entire game from the famous video game music composer, Tommy Tallarico (some credits include Earthworm Jim, Maximo, and Twisted Metal). As for the sound effects, they all sound like they should for video game weapons, alien and human. The voice acting is very impressive also, with great performances by the main characters. Advent Rising's sound overall is superb.A.R. takes anywhere from 12-14 hours to complete. Unfortunately, once you are done with the single player, there is not really too much incentive to go back and play it again except for a choice at the very beginning that effects something towards the end of the game. There is no multiplayer in Advent Rising so, once your done, your done.Advent Rising was supposed to be part of a trilogy. It is not going to happen. Since Advent Rising (and Psychonauts) sold extremely poorly for Majesco, they did not think it would be smart to invest in the rest of the trilogy. The founders of Advent Rising (the Mustard bros.), are now with a new company. They have expressed that they would love to finish the trilogy, but is nearly impossible right now because Majesco has the rights. Hopefully someday the trilogy will be complete.Anyway, Advent Rising is an extremely fun, albeit short, game with fun gameplay, and an amazing soundtrack. If you pick this game up with an open mind, you will like it. You can pick it up at Gamestop for $9.00. Go pick it up.\",\n",

       "  'description': '*Please note that this review was made to encompass both Seasons AND Ages, and I will post this on both game\\'s pages*Game Review: Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons/AgesThe Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons/ Ages, released May 14, 2001 for the Gameboy Color, are the only two games ( Or at least that I know of ) that are not developed first-party by Nintendo. They are instead developed by a company called Flagship. While this might seem like a death sentence especially considering the popularity and renown of this beloved series, Flagship made a fantastic game worthy of every praise given to the first-party developed Zelda games.This review is technically covering two different games, but both of them are related. The first is Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons. The second one is Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages.These two games have mildly related story-lines but you don\\'t need to play both to have a great time ( The only real payment for having both games is being able to unlock some things like the Big-goron sword and battle with Ganon ).First, story. The game has a typical Zelda story making you go out and vanquish various evil beings residing in dungeons. If you have played a Zelda game before you will know what to expect. Not to say that it is bad, on the contrary it is very good and captivating and is better than the story in most other games but a Zelda fan will know that the story isn\\'t the main attraction.The gameplay is simply fantastic. You control link from a top-down perspective and the controls are like those in Legend of Zelda: Link\\'s Awakening. The controls are very intuitive and you won\\'t find any problems here.The enemies you face are also great. You have your old enemies, such as the octorok and others accompanying you to either Holodrum or Labrynna and all of those scary bosses and mini-bosses. They are all very imaginative and many have special little quirks to them that make them unique. The enemies also seem quite well animated considering this is a Gameboy Color game.The environments you travel around are also phenomenal. From the Maku Tree all the way to the depths of Subrosia I was captivated by the places I was traveling around in this game. The music accompanying these environments is also top notch. Of course the music in all the Zelda games has been great and this one is no exception.The items Link gets are fantastic. They include things like the master sword and go all the way down to items like \"Stinky Bag\" which is given to you by an odd long white hand which seems to be stretching out of a toilet ( Gross eh? ). All the classics are here such as the sword\\'s and shields, but some others for instance the Rod of Season\\'s and the Harp of Age\\'s make their appearance as wellThe Rod of Season\\'s (Only in the Seasons game) and the Harp of Age\\'s (Only in the Ages game) are two items that are really quite interesting and fun to use. The way the Rod of Season\\'s works is you stand on a tree stump and swing it, which changes the season. This is involved in many puzzles and such in the game and really is a joy to use. The Harp of Age\\'s fills the same role by initially allowing you to open up time portals scattered around Labrynna but eventually is capable of simply going through time and plunking you down right were you were either in the future or in the past just by playing it.Both of the items are great and are part of what gives this Zelda game it\\'s particularly epic feel.The graphics are rather irrelevant at this point being that it is a Gameboy Color game but I will say that considering when it was made it looks quite nice. The characters and such all have a charm to them that really enforces the atmosphere in the game.I\\'ve already talked about the music but I\\'ll just say that the sound effects are also good, and won\\'t leave you desiring more.And of course no Zelda game is complete without good dungeons, and this game has them aplenty. Every dungeon is jam packed with keys, enemies, mini-bosses, and puzzles. They will all take a fair amount of time to complete as well, making the game quite long in my opinion. The atmosphere is once again great in the dungeonsAlso, boss fights. They are great as always. All the bosses have fun and unique weaknesses which you can exploit to your advantage, giving all the battles sort of a frantic puzzle feel to them. Top regards to the boss fights.Also, both the games are completely different. They are two completely different games with different story-lines, so I really urge you to get both so that you can get the most out of these masterpieces. As when you have both you can fight Ganon and such, which is always a treat.As for one of the games being better than the other, they are both equal. Although I will say I\\'m leaning towards ages slightly, just as a personal preference. Buy them both, I urge you.Is this game fun to play? Yes, yes and yes. It is one of the best games I\\'ve played in my life and I hope you buy it and see why. It\\'s time to dig out that Gameboy Color or Game Boy Advance and wipe the dust off of it, because you are in for a treat!I rate this game a perfect 10/10',\n",

       " {'deck': 'Dragon Ball Z: Burst Limit',\n",
       "  'description': \"Burst Limit is the most recent entry into the long running Dragon Ball    Z fighting series. It released in early June right in the middle of such    releases like Ninja Gaiden II and Metal Gear Solid 4. It's a tough time    to release a game, but I feel Atari has done something good with the    Dragon Ball Z name, however unfortunately it's not all that different    from the previous Dragon Ball Z games, and really doesn't have staying    power. There's a lot in the game to talk about, so let's get to it.      The single-player consists of the Z Chronicles, which is basically the    re-telling of the Dragon Ball Z story. It takes you through the Saiyan,    Freiza, and Cell Sagas. If you're new to the Dragon Ball story, you    will no doubt be confused and sometimes even frustrated with how weird    it will be. This is due to 2 reasons. The first, is that it doesn't    even introduce the characters. You'll probably be saying, Who is this    and why am I fighting him? a lot. The second reason, is because you    also play as the villains in the story, and unlike traditional fighting    games, they seem to keep coming back and you keep switching sides. This    is not a problem for me, as I know the Dragon Ball story, and I know    what's going on. But to a new Dragon Baller, it could end up ruining    the experience that many Dragon Ball fans will enjoy.      When I say that this game isn't all that different from the previous    entries, I mean it in the sense that yep, it's a Dragon Ball Z game.    Obviously there are changes to the game, most notably in the online    addition and the camera angles. There are two things I must say about    the game. The voice acting is both good, and bad. The English dub has    some stellar voice acting as evidence in characters like Goku and    Picollo, but it also has some truly cringe-worthy voice acting from    characters like Vegeta. The Japanese voice acting is solid generally,    but Goku sounds like a little kid. I'm not a Dragon Ball Z aficionado    who watches it with subtitles, so I don't know if that's how he's    supposed to sound. My second point is the music. It's cheesy, but it    fits the series well. The sound effects are done well and the sound    overall is great.      You'll unlock 21 characters in the game throughout your completion of    chapters and sagas. It's not the largest roster for a Dragon Ball game,    but it fits the bill well, especially if you're into Saiyans and all    that crazy, over the top Dragon Ball stuff. I should also add that it    doesn't have the original theme song, which makes me cry inside because    it's so lame, yet iconic. Who wouldn't be excited to hear the theme?    Moving on. The online is buggy and lags quite a bit unfortunately. It's    a nice touch that they added it in, and it's fun, but the lag is    sometimes unbearable. The graphics are awesome, though. It's    beautifully tropical in a way. I'm a sucker for Cel-shaded though.    There are also some framerate drops, but those are very minor.       Burst Limit is definitely a game for the fans of the series, not for    anyone more or anyone less. If you've never played a Dragon Ball Z game    before, I personally recommend you rent it before you buy it. The    campaign will last around 5-6 hours, and if you can handle a bit of lag    online, you'll probably enjoy it's craziness, but definitely not the    story. If you're somewhere in the middle with Dragon Ball Z, check it    out for sure. It's really fun and easy to get into. If you're a    hardcore fan of the game series and the TV show/Manga, you've probably    already made up your mind. This game's for you, so enjoy it.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'I’ve been playing RPGs for eight years now. Ever since I found a copy of ‘Final Fantasy VII’ in the bargain bin at my local GAME, I’ve been hooked to the series, and I own every instalment of the central series released in the UK to date. As a result of this, you may expect my review to be biased. In all honesty, it’s not. Regardless of your position as a gamer, it’s difficult not to appreciate the fourth episode in this long-running saga, released here in the UK as half of ‘Final Fantasy Anthology: European Edition’. Despite some ageing graphics, a few minor conversion flaws and the notable competition from its more recent siblings such as FFs VII, VIII, IX and X, ‘Final Fantasy IV’ on the PlayStation is not only a testament to the SNES console, but a testament to great RPGs in general. It is still a playable and enjoyable game in its own right and it marks the start of the series’ real high point that sadly ended with FFVII.  ‘Final Fantasy IV’ was originally released in 1991 on the Super Nintendo console. Better known as ‘Final Fantasy II’ in the US, the game never hit European shores in cartridge form. However, with the arrival of ‘Final Fantasy Anthology: European Edition’ in 2002 for the PlayStation, British fans finally have the opportunity to familiarise themselves with parts IV and V, and boy, was it worth the wait! ‘Final Fantasy IV’s story focuses primarily on Cecil, a Dark Knight and member of the city of Baron’s airship forces, known as the Red Wings. The game opens with the Red Wings returning from a seek-and-destroy mission in the far-off mages’ town of Mysidia, after having stolen the town’s crystal under King Baron’s orders. Dark Knights, airships, mages, crystals… any fan of the series will instantly feel right as home with the plot, which, while initially simplistic, becomes very complicated and significantly blurs the concepts of right and wrong. In this way, ‘Final Fantasy IV’ was the first FF to deal with the issue of morality, now a fundamental part of the stories of many FF games.  While the introduction (and surprising complexity) of the game’s storyline may be enough to bring nostalgic tears to many fanboys’ eyes, even the most hardened FF veterans will feel a rush of joy once they get into the gameplay of this instalment. It’s a standard FF affair, really. You control a band of adventurers (up to five at any one time in the game), and travel around the gameworld, solving puzzles, dungeon crawling, opening treasure chests, collecting and equipping better weapons and armour and fighting random battles before triggering a strand of plotline. Then you repeat the process until the next plot detail is uncovered, and so on and so forth. While it may sound simplistic and ultimately boring, many (myself included) find FF gameplay to be surprisingly fun, wonderfully addictive and, in the case of random battles, very deep and tactical as well.  Yes, random battles are once again a key part of the game. The very mention of these sends a fair few gamers running to the hills, tearing their hair out and screaming. FF has thrived off random battles, and FFIV is no exception. FFIV features a very sophisticated system whereby each character has a set of actions specific to their class. This system made a welcome reappearance in the more recent FFIX, and it makes for some incredibly tactical battles, and boss battles in particular. By effectively setting your party into front and back rows, you can have your most powerful physical hitters up front with your mages casting offensive and defensive spells from the back. It’s a great system and it’s been implemented into other FFs, although nowhere near as successfully. FFIV is also the first FF to feature the Active Time Battle (ATB) system, a feature in most of the FFs since. Essentially it provides a build up time for attacks, meaning that there are times where you’ll be exposed to enemy attack. It also more beneficial than turn-based battle from a strategic viewpoint, as it allows you to order and structure your attacks carefully. This is especially useful against bosses who follow certain attack patterns.  ‘Final Fantasy IV’s gameplay is most certainly its strongest aspect. Unfortunately, being a straight port of one of the oldest SNES games around, its aesthetics leave a lot to be desired. Graphically, the game is sub-par. Everything is 2D and rather simplistic and ugly, although this shouldn’t be too much of an issue to long-term fans of the series who enjoy the top-notch gameplay, which is something FFIV has in spades. The game does have its moments, particularly in-battle with some of the magic spells and summons. However, on the whole the game looks old. Admittedly, it is, but Square Enix could have spruced it up a little for its UK debut, rather than leaving it untouched. The other aspect is the game’s sound. The variety and quality of the music is superb, with Nobuo Uematsu pushing the SNES to its limits. However, the sounds do appear to have a very tinny quality, which could be a result of the game’s conversion to PlayStation. It doesn’t hinder the gameplay at all, but it does rob the game of some of its original aural majesty. This isn’t the only niggle caused through conversion either: the Save function is particularly cumbersome. Rather than using the standard 15-slot approach of all the other PS1 FFs, ‘Final Fantasy IV’ emulates the SNES version’s Save function, using two memory card blocks to create a four-slot cartridge-style save. This results in very long loading times, and can be very annoying. You can’t help but think every time you load your game that with a little more time, this Save function could have been refined.  ‘Final Fantasy IV’ has no hope of winning over the anti-RPG movement. The standard FF gameplay will be the dividing point for many gamers. Gamers who feel at home with steadily paced adventuring broken up with random battles and enforced by a strong plot will feel instantly at home with FFIV. At the opposite end of the spectrum, people who prefer action-oriented games may not find FFIV to be their cup of gaming tea. It all boils down to this: FFIV plays very much identically to the later instalments in the series that we’ve all come to either love or hate. If you don’t like the other PS1 FFs, then steer clear of this one. But if you’ve enjoyed the series to date, you’d be a fool to pass up on this excellent slice of classic RPG gaming.',\n",

       "  'description': \" PRESENTATION:  2 out of 5 This compilation has a very basic and mostly generic menu system to select your games from. None of it looks particularly great, but it isn't bottom of the barrel either. The loading times are also a little on the long side, especially when initially booting the game. There is also a small problem with not being able to save the setting for the aspect ratio. All other settings will save and load later on as expected, but the aspect ratio setting will never save for some reason and always be at the default when you load the game later.  GRAPHICS:  5 out of 5 All of the games have precisely the same visuals you expect from them.  Perfectly emulated.  SOUND: 4 out of 5 All sounds, music and sound effects, are accounted for and emulated well except for a few here and there.  GAMEPLAY:  3 out of 5 As with any compilation, some games have aged well better than others. Having said that, nostalgia can go a long way to making it more enjoyable than it would otherwise be. For instance, I know Art of Fighting, Fatal Fury, and World Heroes don't hold up so well anymore, but since I was pretty big into these games at the time of their release, they can still be decent fun. I was surprised to find that many of them hold up better than I expected, like Baseball Stars 2, Last Resort, Top Hunter, and Neo Turf Masters. The titles that stand out the most are: Metal Slug, Samurai Shodown, Shock Troopers, and King of Fighters '94.  LASTING APPEAL:  4 out of 5 Obviously, the amount of lasting value you will get out of this compilation is directly related to your affinity for the games within. I enjoy most of the games in this compilation, even the admittedly not-so-great ones.  OVERALL:  3.5 out of 5 This is a much better compilation that I thought it would be and if you are a SNK/Neo-Geo fan, this is totally worth picking up! \\t\\t\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Rainbow Six Vegas 2 is a sequel to the 2006 Tactical Shooter, Rainbow Six Vegas. After playing both games to their entirety, it is apparent that between the two not much has changed. The Rainbow Series' game play is based on tactical shooting, using cover and teamwork to accomplish a set goal. The latest addition to the series uses this system to perfection but does nothing to innovate and add to the gameplay. The one addition is a sprint button that does nothing but speed up the game and make it easier to move from cover to cover.   Despite playing exactly as the original the action keeps you on the edge of your seat constantly. Terrorists will flank and use grenades but thats the extent to which the enemy AI functions. Enemies will still run out into the open and rely more on sheer numbers than actual tactics. In some scripted instances, the terrorists will rappel down behind your position leaving the player and his team in a tight spot.   Graphically Rainbow Six has never looked better. Comparing the PC version to the console, its hard to notice any kind of graphical difference. In some cases the PC actually looks better but to achieve those visuals a high end computer is needed. The campaign takes place in exotic areas such as Las Vegas, Pic De Pyrenees and Coast Rica. Each location is a visual masterpiece, especially Coast Rica the scene of the final mission.   Because R6V2 is a tactical shooter and taking cover is a vital game play element which means the control scheme must work. By clicking the right mouse button the player enters cover and upon release the player exits cover. This system works well because its extremely easy to enter cover seeing as all that has to be done is moving your middle finger. The other controls are easy to use and seem natural.   During my play through the game crashing bugs many people have encountered didn't plague me. I was able to steadily work my way through at leisure and not worry about bugs or glitches, even on Vista.   Rainbow Six Vegas 2 continues on the success of previous entries in the series and while it doesn't move the series in a new direction it is still a phenomenal game with a story that captivates the player. With a fantastic story, unrivaled game play Rainbow Six Vegas 2 could easy be one of the best shooters of the year. A must buy for all FPS fans.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Assasin's Creed is a game with a great story, great locations, a good set of gameplay mechanincs and but a few minor annoyances.The game features two inter-linked story arcs: one set in the near future, and another nearly a thousand years a go. The main story (from an overall plot perspective, not the story most heavily featured) has your character Desmond captured by a scientific research organisation. There intentions are to use a device call 'the animus' to access your genetic memories (memories passed on from generation to generation through the gentic code) in order to find something. Entering in to these memories grants you control of Altaïr, an extremely agile 12th century assasin who caught in the holy land in the middle of the crusades. The majority of the game is then spent assasinating various targets for your master, Al Mualim, and learning of the connection that these men hold, bringing you closer to that which your modern day captors seek.For the most part, your main interaction comes from receieving targets from Al Mualim, leader of the Assasins Creed, and heading out to the city where they can be found. It is then your job to move about the city in order to gain an understanding of the surroundings and aquire information that will help you locate and kill your target. You do this by scalling tall towers, or 'view points', to spot where you can find information and then do a vaiety of tasks to get this information. These tasks include: eavsdropping on certain conversation, pick pocketing people for relevant maps and letters and helping other memers of the Creed in exchange for details they have already aquired. These tasks can prove to be fun, with individual dialogue accompanying each one - but the limited number of task types can feel repetitive towards the end of the game.Once you have learnt enough to locate the target your attentions then turn to the assasination. The target's location is added to your map, and can usually be found at some sort of public event. You watch a small in game scene, which helps flesh out your targets, before you can move in and kill them. Sometimes this will be a case of sneaking behind them to steathily take them down, and other times you will be spotted and have to chase the target down while the city guard attempt to stop you. After the assination you must escape to the local Assasins Bereau with the entire city on high alert, resulting in any time you are spotted you will be chased. Any time in the game that you are being chased you have to either fight and kill all of your pursuers or break their line of sight and then hide in a mound of hay, a roof garden or blend in with a group of scolars until the coast is clear.You repeat this formula for a number of targets, each one cryptically revealing more of the underlying plot. While the method is similar, each assasination has a unique situation and context to keep you interested on top of the ever developing story. The fighting in the game does a good job of enabling you to fend of multiple attackers, whose number genrally increases over the course of the game. Your main weapon here is your sword, while your hidden dagger, fists and to a lesser extenet your throwing knives/short sword are more suited to other situations. You can attack and block, and as you proceed though the game you learn to, amongst other thins, counter enemy attacks. The fighting is good, but later in the game I did feel that the game could allow you to be a little more aggressive, as you tend to rely mainly on counters to win battles. The free running is excellent, feeling smooth and fun to do. Climbing is well animated and manages to feel organic thanks to excellent level design, with movement only available is there is a ledge, crack or outcrop for Altaïr to grab on to. Sometimes, however, you may find that you cannot get Altaïr to move in the direction you want, despite having a route to move on, occasionally resulting in him leaping to his death instead of hopping across to the next hand hold. As mentioned at the start the scenery is breathtaking and each city is populated with thousands of citizens - creating an effective city atmosphere. There are three main huge cities to explore, with a large open 'world map' type area to cross on horseback to reach your destination. A nice feature is that later on you can skip the travelling between cities to help keep the story moving. The sound design is also strong with good set of voice acting, both in Desmond and Altaïr's world, and a suitable accompanying soundtrack which varies with location and level of tension/action.While some parts of this game may feel a bit repetitve, the visual design, the excellent game engine and a good, if not confusing, story to tie it together, more than make up for this. Even if the objectives get tiring, you can always run and leap across the rooftops or dive huge distances into a cart of hay because it is simply fun to do and watch. My only critisim of the game is that for all that it does well, it leaves you wishing that some of the repition\\xa0 and other small annoyances had been dealt with to make a great game even better.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Game Review: Day of Defeat: SourceDay of Defeat started out like many multi-player shooting games, as a Half Life 1 modification. And DoD just like Counter Strike was discovered by Half Life developer Valve and made into a full fledged game. And with Half Life 2 and the incredibly powerful source engine a reality, Day of Defeat: Source was made. I myself have not played the original Day of Defeat, but I can be pretty sure it is a lot like this game.Like Team Fortress 2 the game is a class based multi-player FPS. What this means is that you can choose a class, which is basically a preset soldier with all his weapons already equipped, and get into the action. This differs dramatically from the style of shooting games Quake founded. Quake style games such as Halo have everyone starting with the same equipment and the stronger weapons are all scattered around the stage.Now, onto the gameplay. All of the classes seem quite balanced, which is a very good thing. The classes are generally very specialized, which means that for instance, the sniper class is very bad in close-quarters combat. This adds to the team element of the game. There are some odd choices when it comes to classes however. For instance, not only does the German rocket class have a less versatile weapon, he also has a slower rocket launcher. This could be said to make up for the \"Weaker\" American support class, although many now agree that the American support is better. The assault class, who\\'s main weapon is focused around close combat, has a pistol as a side weapon. This is questionable because the pistol is rather worthless to the assault class, considering it has the ultimate close range weapon. Also, even though the game seems to be built in a way that people can push objects to block doorways and such, in practice it is rarely seen and is rather hard to do.If you have a microphone plugged into your computer, you can easily use this to quickly communicate with you teammates. If you don\\'t have a microphone, you can also use the voice commands that are built into the game.The game takes place in ww2 so there is very little protection in the game. A single shot to the head will kill anyone. This makes the game quite methodical sometimes, as you know you could be quickly and easily taken out at any second. This element of the game makes communication even more important, so it is great that Valve implemented such good microphone support.The graphics in the game are whats to be expected from a Source engine game, great. Of course they are a bit dated since the game was released a while ago. This was the first Source game to support HDR and when it is enabled just makes the game even prettier. The frame rate will hold steady on pretty much all newer systems.The sound in the game is also top notch. The game is made so that you can stop and listen to enemy footsteps and determine where the enemy is coming from. This adds a whole new strategic tool to the game, and can really be powerful in the hands of a strong player.The community is what you would expect from a multi-player shooting game. Although less immense than Counter Strike, Day of Defeat also has a strong community following it. You will never have a problem finding a server to play on. While some people are deterred from multi-player games by the sometimes immature community, that is not something to worry about in Day of Defeat.Overall, Day of Defeat has a lot going for it. If you have an interest in ww2 shooting games or multi-player games in general, this game might be for you. It has a strong community, great graphics, and a slightly more mature vibe than Counter Strike: Source. Even though it is a bit dated in this day and age, I suggest that you pick it up and give it a try!Overall Score: 9.5',\n",

       "  'description': 'Reviewed by Callum Brine 5 starsHalo 3 picks off straight after where halo 2 left of it drops you straight in to the action with out a 2 long and boring cut scene like what halo 2 had. For new players new to the halo series this will feel a very easy game to pick when you get in to the game you will have a little tutorial what pretty good for new players and it ties in with the story kind off. Halo 3’s campaign will take most players who are used to fps genre about 15 hours play maybe even less but halo 3 has lots of replay value in it so you will have to go trough the game a good few times before you’ve got all the skull terminal and completed the game on all difficulty’s. This time in halo 3 for co op instead of every 1 playing as master chief the other player will play as 3 elites and 1 famous elite the arbiter but this time you have normal 2 player co-op and new to halo is 4 player online co-op what very fun playing halo with 4 of your mates over xbox live .But the main thing what will keep you coming back for more and more of halo 3 will have to be the multiplayer this will last for ever and with all the file sharing and the map downloads I can see halo 3 being in the eyes of us gamers for many years to come. also there are new armour for Spartans and elites to unlock for online what can be unlocked from getting skull terminal promotion on multiplayer mode and completing certain lever on certain difficulties.  Also they have added forge mode to halo 3 what lets you kind of edit the maps for multiplayer mode as it dose not let you build a map from scratch it lets you put weapons down were you want and object what can change the way you play a map quite a lot. The story of halo 3 continues straight after were halo 2 left of and brings and end to the saga in a very nice way(remember wait till after the credits) I wont give to much away about the story in case I spoil it for people who have not played it.   Halo 3 if a very good game but not amazing as we were expecting but is still worth playing the only reason I didn’t give the game 10 out 10 was down to there are some pretty serious faults in the game what cant be over looked but still a very good game ',\n",

       "  'description': 'Halo 3 is a great game. Well, most of it. The campaign leaves much to be desired, although its story is fairly interesting. Its over almost before it has begun. What makes Halo a great game is the multiplayer. Unlike other good first person shooters, you can have someone playing online next to you with up to fourteen other people, which adds a lot to the overall fun. Also its very versatile with many game types and customizable options and maps using Forge. Bungie helps alot with the online experience, having a site which lets you view most every every statistic you can think off. The community is great with plenty of interestign things always in the works. Like anywhere, some people online are just flat out obnoxious, but you can always mute them if you really want. Halo will give you months of entertainment with you and your friends. ',\n",

The first boss\\xa0 you encounter is the sea serpent from the box art and the title screen.\\xa0 Then you fight a giant crab that is a pain to beat.\\xa0 Next up is a giant squid also tough.\\xa0 Fourth boss is the return of the sea serpent with a new outfit.\\xa0 Apparently beating him made him made so he decided to dress in red and black.\\xa0 Finally you battle against the infamous Jaws..wait what....OK not the Jaws, but its a big ol' shark anyway.\\xa0 These boss fights are pretty challenging.\\xa0 They are big and take up a good portion of the screen.\\xa0 Their attacks do massive damage to your little boat.\\xa0 It doesn't help that the controls prevent you from moving quickly enough to dodge attacks while being able to shoot in the direction of the boss. This game is certainly not the greatest NES game ever, but is one of my personal favorites.\\xa0 My childhood was spent trying to beat this game with my cousin.\\xa0 I have to say I love this game even with its control issues and ridiculously hard boss fights.\\xa0 If your looking for an old school fix and are ready for a challenge I highly recommend tracking down a copy of Cobra Triangle.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Completing a game\\'s story and beating the boss is an accomplishment in most games. In the case of Super Mario Galaxy, the game is just getting started by the time you\\'ve beat Bowser for the final time and saved Princess Peach and the universe. Miyamoto and team have taken everything they\\'ve learned about good and bad gameplay in the last 20 or so years and created a game that\\'s both simple and deep.Aside from some sadistic RPGs, beating the final boss and being only 25% done with the game is unheard of. In your initial play through with Mario, there\\'s 120 Stars to collect. Doing so unlocks Luigi as a playable character, with whom you can then complete the game a second time. Collecting 120 stars with Luigi opens up the \"Grand Finale Galaxy\" rewarding the player with two more stars (one for Mario, one for Luigi) and a quick note and picture sent to your Wii Message Board. Thankfully, getting all 242 Stars (and 9999 Star Bits) is enjoyable to the very last minute.\\xa0 Not everyone may be willing to make that sort of time investment in any type of activity, videogames or otherwise, but you can rest easy knowing that any time you put into this game up until\\xa0 the very end will be something you will not soon forget.Where Super Mario Galaxy most drastically departs from its immediate predecessor -- the Gamecube\\'s Super Mario Sunshine -- is not so much in what it adds, but what it omits. Gone are the blue coin hunts, water hosing, and kicking fruit from one side of an island to the other. In its place is a purer platforming experience, one where most of your time will be spent running through, jumping across, and otherwise avoiding some of the most creative obstacles to be found in any platformer or action game on any system, current or classic. Instead of being forced to insert Star objectives into traditional large open-world levels, Super Mario Galaxy\\'s designers had the freedom to create its levels around various play mechanics, many of which have not been seen before in any genre of videogame. It\\'s not fair to spoil these for you, but I guarentee you\\'ll catch yourself giggling to yourself on more than several occasions and wonder why no one has thought of these mechanics before.There\\'s still some coin collecting in the later stages once the Purple Coin Comet becomes unlocked after beating the final Bowser boss fight. These for some are the one detracter from the overall game\\'s pacing, but for many, especially Luigi\\'s Purple Coin\\'s, these can be equally fun, frustrating, and thoroughly rewarding once you finally earn your Star for completing the level.The Co-Star mode is great if you have younger members of your family that are not quite ready to grasp the coordination needed to get Mario through the later levels. For the youngest members, they can take control using a second Wii controller and shoot star bits to stun enemies and some platforms in the environments. For the slightly older ones ready to control Mario, you can help them out using the same stun mechanic so they aren\\'t overwhelmed by the enemies. It\\'s a two-sided system that, while useless for the advanced Mario player, is a bright addition that could have easily been overlooked by Miyamoto.If you have enjoyed any Mario platformer published in the last 23 years or any platformer or action game on any system for that matter, you owe it to yourself and your household to pick up this instant classic.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Previously known as Unreal Tournament 2007, Unreal Tournament 3 has been available on both the Playstation 3 and PC for several months now, and after a long delay due to timed exclusivity for the PS3 version, 360 owners finally get to delve into this generations old school tournament style twitch shooter. If you\\'ve played UT2K4 on the PC or Unreal Championship from the original Xbox then you probably have a good idea on what you\\'ll be getting into. The game is still structured as an arena Deathmatch-CTF battleground where you\\'ll be spending a lot of your time fragging, and doing an equal amount of time blowing up.   Unreal Tournament probably shouldn\\'t feel as new and exciting as it does. When you think about it, UT 3 does very little change in the Unreal universe. The game is relatively the same as past iterations of the franchise, its still the multiplayer frag fast reminiscent of Quake. With most multiplayer centric shooters slowing things down and becoming more militaristic and realistic Unreal feels like a breath of fresh air, which is hard to say about most old-school style games thus Unreal 3 contains its own charm, an somewhat of a nostalgic feel.   The UT games have never been about the campaign, so anyone approaching any Unreal game expecting the singleplayer to be worth a damn would be sadly mistaken. The tradition continues in this game with the campaign trickling down to bot matches separated by poorly written cutscenes. The Unreal universe is in trouble, first it was a tournament, but now its real! Respawners on the battlefield have changed how war is fought (but I thought war never changes!?). Deathmatches are still just a frag count, but how does Capture the Flag play into a serious war? Well in order to take out the enemy\\'s respawners you have to obtain their Field Lattice Generator, or FLAGS, and bring it back to your own base-This is me rolling my eyes. Give me a break. The story doesn\\'t need much explanation, bad guys try to kill good guys, your bulky good guy (Epics awesome at rendering big guys in huge body armor), play about 50 bot matches, defeat bad guys. On the plus the campaign is playable with four people, and its a good source for achievement points.   Epic is infamous with throwing tons of maps into their games out of the box, and UT3 is no exception. UT3 contains dozens of maps, all of course are built for specific multiplayer game modes. There are a healthy variety of maps for all the game modes, and rightfully so. This way all the maps are balanced for their respective playing mode. All the maps are expertly designed, and fun to play in, and non of which are dull or bland, looking beautiful thanks to the games under the hood engine. Overall, UT3 contains some of the highest map quality you\\'ll see in a videogame this year with plenty of symmetrical, interesting level layouts for the objective-based modes, and a high variation of environments.   Anyways, the games visuals are a standout, absolutely fantastic. Considering we\\'ve seen the Unreal tech in countless games, we finally see the damn game itself, and the engine performs as well as ever. You\\'ll instantly see the art style the game shares with its 3rd person counterpart Gears of War, but thats a good thing. The sound is pretty much similar to what you\\'ve herd in past Unreal games, the guns sound modernized but no one will find any surprises, the Flak cannon sounds like a Flak Cannon, the Rocket Launcher sound like, well, a Rocket Launcher. The only annoyance I\\'ve encountered is in single player, the bots are very chatty, do I really need to know if my guys about to score from three different bots at once? Just return the damn flag! However, this annoyance isn\\'t present in multiplayer, and unless you love playing co-op, or your an achievement hunter just skip the campaign all together.  Anyone whose played Unreal will find no surprises in UT3\\'s arsenal. All the classic weapons are present, all with minor balancing tweaks. The shield gun has been replaced with the Impact Hammer, and your default weapon is a low powered pistol, which has actually holds its own compared to other pick up weapons. The Sniper Rifle is still good fun for headshots, the Redeemer is still the high powered Nuke which can take out half the map guaranteeing the opposing team crying out \"cheap!\". The Flak Cannon\\'s secondary fire has become a little slower, and forcing you to be a bit more accurate, but nothing drastic. Even if the weapons are the same, that doesn\\'t mean they don\\'t kick major ass, and feel great.   Unreal Tournament 3 is a very basic package, but that doesn\\'t mean UT3 doesn\\'t have if fair share of multiplayer madness and thrills. While playing UT3 its very obvious how multiplayer gaming has changed in the sense that these style of games just aren\\'t made anymore, and quiet possibly outdated by most counts. The only other game like this on the platform is Quake 4, and that wasn\\'t a very competent port. This is the reason why its impossible to not recommend UT3 to shooter fans, this game isn\\'t unique to gaming in general, but it\\'s unique to the 360 library, and console gaming altogether.  Unlike modern shooters like Halo, Call of Duty, Battlefield, and so on, UT3 doesn\\'t have any perks or rewards to extensive play. Not seeing a little +10, or seeing a rank next to your gamertag wouldn\\'t mean anything last year. But this will probably be a turn off for some people if mere leaderboard rank doesn\\'t interest you. The Quake series moved from its roots into a Battlefield-like experience with its Quake Wars game, so this may very well indeed be the last true Unreal game. With its variety in modes, healthy amount of fantastically constructed maps, UT3 is one of the best multiplayer experiences you\\'ll have this year. If you can get over the lack of rewards, and go into this stoked for old-school action, then it will be impossible to be disappointed. Epic might use Gears of War as their flagship franchise, but it\\'s Unreal that structured their company and gave them their fame.   Pros  Looks great Controls are sharp, and shooting is a breeze  Difficulty is well balanced Old School formula, with a new school look has its charm Amazing animations For a gritty Unreal Engine game, the game is very colorful  Solid map design Top notch performance, you\\'ll encounter very little lag if you have a reasonable connection  Some of the best control I\\'ve seen in a console shooter, rivaling Call of Duty   Cons  Single Player experience is worthless Mods are nowhere to be found Terrible writing Some texture popping is present before matches start, but not as bad as Gears Multiplayer doesn\\'t give you much to work for.

       "  'description': 'It is agonizingly difficult for me to review a game such as this. Final Fantasy X simply defies easy summary, analysis, and categorization. Actually, scratch that: it nullifies the dictionary and invalidates the thesaurus. Honestly, a game like this needs to be experienced, no matter your stance on Square, turn based combat, or even role playing games in general. You can stop right there if you so desire, since chances are, I won\\'t be able to convince you any further over the length of this self-indulgent review.  Sheesh. Where to begin? Final Fantasy X is a turn-based role playing game developed by Squaresoft for the PlayStation 2. Square have of course shaped a name for themselves as the connoisseurs of the role playing genre over the last couple of decades, and Final Fantasy X is a glittering textbook example of Square\\'s craftmanship. Every element of excellence that defines the franchise is present here, from the memorable, emotionally charged storyline to the unfathomably impressive soundtrack; from the ostentatious art direction to the immaculate turn-based battle system.   Final Fantasy X tells the story of Tidus, a youthful, energetic soul dressed in utterly bizarre clothing, and his troupe of companions, including Auron, a stony-faced, mysterious sword fighter, Yuna, a fragile, beautiful summoner, Wakka, a friendly yet somewhat irritating blitzball player, Lulu, a controlled, businesslike magic user, Rikku, an overly hyperactive and almost intolerable teenager, and the completely emotionless Kimahri, who has little useful role in both the storyline and the overall gameplay. The characters are obviously very distinctive, and although the latter two are reasonably annoying for their own reasons, Final Fantasy X definitely features one of the finest character casts in video game history.   These seven adventurers are the individuals that you will become acquainted with over the course of the game\\'s rather expansive 40-hour quest, and by the end of the game, you\\'ll probably have a certain attachment to at least three of them. The game is set in the troubled world of Spira, and follows a rather traditional basic plotline of \"only these seven people can save the world from devastation\". However, the game\\'s storyline features several brilliant twists and turns, interesting one-liners, and character development, resulting in a largely amazing work of fiction that is clearly head and shoulders above what you will find in almost every other video game. The game\\'s conclusion is poignant and unforgettable, simultaneously providing a large sense of closure and an amazing amount of emotional climax. I daresay that regardless of how sensitive you are, there is a high chance that you will cry at the end of this game. I know I did.   The world of Spira is fairly varied and expansive, cleverly disguising the fact that Final Fantasy X is actually surprisingly linear. There is not much backtracking at all to be done in this game, and not much backtracking is even possible until things get slightly less claustrophobic near the end of the game. Nevertheless the game is so compelling that you\\'ll never feel the urge to backtrack; a more common craving is to continue on, just to the next cutscene, or the next boss battle, anything to discover more about the storyline.   The battles in this game are of course turn-based, and the battle system is fine-tuned to a point where there\\'s hard to find fault with any element of it. As per usual, your three characters will stand in a line facing a line of enemies, and you\\'ll simply attack each other in a variety of ways until you win or lose. Of course, there are interesting factors thrown in for an extra level of intensity and strategy; magic, overdrives (an incredibly powerful special attack that is hard to come by) and aeons, which are basically best described as giant Pokemon that Yuna summon during battle. The series probably has the greatest turn-based battle systems in the world of video games, and if I\\'m not mistaken, Final Fantasy X is a perfect example of that.   There are no glaring flaws in this game; however, there are several small elements of the game that I feel the need to address. Just to nitpick, you know? First off, Final Fantasy X has an excruciatingly slow and confusing beginning, which initially put me off. Thankfully I gained enough motivation to continue forward through the treacle of the opening and into the wide expanse of brilliance that dominates the other 37 hours of the game, although I\\'m betting a few players will have just abandoned this game right there.   Another personal infuriation of mine was the sometimes gruelling difficulty of the game. It\\'s not horrendously challenging, but sometimes I felt the game was being plain unfair. Maybe it\\'s because I\\'m not a hardcore RPG player, but I find it extremely annoying when three extremely fast enemies Ambush me (so that they all attack first) and make my entire party confused, resulting in my party killing each other before I even get a turn of play. The boss battles in the game, however, are pleasantly challenging when you figure out a solid strategy, and beating each successive boss fills you with such a sense of euphoria and accomplishment that it\\'s hard to believe you were ever angry at them in the first place.   The puzzle elements in the game aren\\'t quite as fulfilling as I would have liked them to be, either. Yuna\\'s pilgrimage through Spira requires her to visit a series of temples, each with their own puzzle inside. These puzzles are quite redundant and irritating, since they all revolve around putting spheres into corresponding holes, which is personally not my idea of fun. The first time around it might have been quite enjoyable, but in the end it just seems somewhat uninspired and trite. I\\'m fairly sure the brains at Square could have done better in this department.  Although, yes, I\\'m just nitpicking.   Anyway, Square do an exceptional job on the visual and aural side of things. Final Fantasy showcases some of the most inspired art direction I have ever seen in a video game. Spira is genuinely beautiful, even on the PlayStation 2 in 2008. The environments have a certain magical elegance about them that few other developers know how to bring to life. On top of that, the characters are extremely distinguished, and although their fashion sense is probably questionable, they are still undeniably some of the coolest heroes I\\'ve ever laid eyes on. The cutscenes in the game, too, are absolutely jaw-dropping. They are few and far between, but when the CGI cutscenes come around, they are really something special, particularly towards the end of the game.   And, inevitably, Nobuo Uematsu and friends deliver on the soundtrack. Nobuo\\'s renown and prestige within the videogaming world in regard to audio and music is incontestible, and Final Fantasy X is a shining beacon of his brilliance. The game is absolutely bursting with some of the most consistently creative tunes I have ever heard, not just in the gaming world, but in absolutely any entertainment medium. I\\'m sure that years from now I will look back on this soundtrack and receive such a fragrant scent of nostalgia that I\\'ll simply have to play this game again, just because of the merits of its music. The theme song of the game has one of the most beautiful melodies I have ever heard, and there are countless other infectious original pieces peppering the game. Even the battle theme, which grates in almost every single role playing game (since you hear it about a thousand times) doesn\\'t seem to get old; a feat that not even Pokemon can boast of.   The voice overs in the game seem to be a cause for concern for many people, but not for me. I found the voice overs to really fit the character designs, and although there were several instances of bad dialogue, that\\'s mainly because of the script and the translation from Japanese, not because of the voice actors themselves. There\\'s plenty of talent in the acting here.  And with that... I guess I have overcome the agonizing difficulty of reviewing a game such as this, although I am not sure if I have even came close to doing this game justice. This game is, bluntly, a work of art. It\\'s a masterwork. It\\'s absolutely miles above 95% of every other game I\\'ve ever played in terms of storytelling, art direction, and musical score, and that in itself makes for an unbelievably compelling experience, despite the fact that the game occasionally stumbles in other areas. I wholeheartedly recommend this transcendental masterpiece of a game, if only so you can sit there on your bed at 3am, controller abandoned on the floor, tears flowing freely down your face, credits rolling, with the realization that you have just finished one of the greatest experiences videogaming has to offer.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Game Review: Team Fortress 2The last game in the Orange Box is also the one that gives it the replay value it needs. Valve realized that their Orange Box, while great, has lots of short games in it. To make up for it they put a game in the genre that never dies, Online First Person Shooters.Team Fortress 2\\'s development took a long time, a very long time. It was often compared to Duke Nukem Forever in the way that both of them were highly anticipated, yet constantly pushed back and delayed. The TF2 team made a few prototype games, one of them revolving around the concept of one player being a commander of one team and having an RTS like interface to assign orders, before they finally settled on the game we now know as Team Fortress 2.Ok, now lets get on to the real review! First we will discuss the graphics. They are fantastic. The graphics in this game are amazing to say the least. The art style is really off the wall and makes you feel like you are in some sort of comic book, unlike the other games based on the source engine which take a really realistic approach. This is a breath of fresh air in a genre that I would personally say takes itself too seriously. The style of the graphics really sets the mood of the entire game and makes it less dreary and gloomy like some multiplayer shooters tend to be. The graphics are also highly scalable which allows for weaker computers to handle the game as well, this is a good trait shared by pretty much all the games running on the source engine.But graphics are nothing without gameplay right? The gameplay is also top notch. The game revolves around two teams, the RED and the BLU (Not a typo) fighting for supremacy in a number of different locales, all of them sharing that same distinct TF2 art style. The original Team Fortress is often called \"The granddaddy of class-based shooters\" and TF2 sets the bar even higher. There are nine classes, all of them completely unique and brimming with personality. The Heavy Weapons Guy is a giant Russian man obsessed with his gun and killing people. The Scout is a skinny kid with a New England accent who seems to love bashing people with his bat. And the Demoman is in his own words, a black Scottish cyclops. Anyway, you get the point.The personality complements the graphics well, once again establishing the light-hearted feel of the game. Each class has its own weapon loadout, and all of them are wacky and once again, complement the rest of the game. Nothing feels out of place. The medic has a syringe gun which fits its purpose of last resort fallback weapon perfectly. All of the melee weapons in the game are based around the classes personality, the psychosis of the Heavy Weapon Guy coming through perfectly in his melee weapon, AKA: His fists.The balancing is great for the most part as well. There is a class for every person and situation. You have bad aim but like to be in the front lines? Heavy Weapon\\'s Guy is for you. You like being a supporter? Engineer or Medic is a perfect fit. A team really has to work together to win in Team Fortress 2, unlike some other online FPS games. If the enemy is defending a lot your Medics and Heavy Weapon\\'s Guys can team up and get an Ubercharge ( If the medic heals enough, he gets the ubercharge which can make one teammate invincible for a short period of time, essential for breaking defenses.)The only problems with the balancing are mostly intentional things on the developers part. The critical hit system, while good, is a bit too random. It is a blast for the person who happens to get lucky and have a critical hit, but not so much for the person on the receiving end. The worst offender is the Soldier class, who\\'s rocket launcher when it gets critical hits is absolutely devastating. But these small problems can be ignored considering the game is for the most part very well balanced.Sound is also great, the best part of it being the things the characters say. There is a large library of voice commands you can make, these are all fully lip synced by your character model and are really well done. Also, some are automatic, when the Heavy Weapon\\'s Guy kills a lot of people in a short period of time, he starts singing this jolly old song which is really hilarious. And there are dozens of voice commands for every single class, which if used effectively can actually give you an advantage over someone who doesn\\'t use them. Other than the voices, the sound is still very good. The music is original and catchy, even though you won\\'t be hearing it much (This isn\\'t a single player game)Map design is very well done, and the maps are a shining example of TF2\\'s art style. The RED team\\'s bases all use warm colors in their design and have a very country-side feel to them. The BLU team on the other hand has a very industrial look and have very angular structures all around. Both the team\\'s bases hide highly exaggerated arsenals of missiles and such, once again fitting in nicely with the overall theme of the game. The only problem with the levels is that there aren\\'t enough of them. Although one new map has been released since the debut of the game, the selection still seems very thin. This is remedied by the quality of the maps though, which are all of the highest caliber.Also, worth mention is the increasing depth of the game. Valve, the creators of Team Fortress and other wonders, has recently released an update not only containing a brand new map, but also new unlockable weapons for the Medic class. Doing specific things in the game beats things called achievements and once you have enough of these you can unlock some of these weapons for the medic class. This is fantastic, and awesome. Also, new weapons animations have been released for pretty much all the melee weapons, another plus. The unlockable weapons system is said to be in production for every single class in the game, adding more and more depth and enjoyment to this already great experience.Team Fortress 2 is not a game you should miss, it is simply of the highest quality. It has also been released individually recently, and while it is still more of a deal to buy it in the Orange Box if you have some sort of vendetta against the other games in it (For instance, if one of those games killed a beloved family member) you can now get TF2 separately. If you like shooting games, not just online ones but even regular FPSs you should get this game. It is one of the best executed and best crafted games I\\'ve played in my entire life, and I can see this game being played for years to come. So, buy it now!5/54.5/5 individually ',\n",

       " {'deck': 'Mass Effect Review - Xbox 360',\n",
       "  'description': '2007 was a legendary year for the gaming industry. It was a year that was loaded with what would have been potential game of the year choices for any other year. It seemed as if that another triple-A title came in with every passing week. 2007’s releases were of such quality that one may even be so bold as to say that the bar for game developers all over the globe has officially been raised to a whole new level because of them. Considering this, it would undoubtedly be a difficult task to select the best game from such an elite bunch, but for me, this choice was rather easy.  Mass Effect was a game that completely fit my gaming interests, in fact, it almost seems as if the title was built from the ground up with my preferences in mind. It’s mesmerizing visuals, intuitive gameplay, and captivating story combine to make Mass Effect a truly wonderful package that is a cannot miss for any true RPG fan.  Now, with all of the above being said, you wouldn’t expect me to make\\xa0such strong accusations without backing myself up would you? Graphics - In the past BioWare (the producers of Mass Effect) have always had solid visuals in their console games. The KOTOR series, the Baldur’s Gate series, and Jade Empire are just a few of the visually impressive titles that BioWare has churned out in the past few years. So, to say the least, Mass Effect falls in line with this tradition of excellence. The environments of the game are spot on, the developers definitely nailed the futuristic look of the world. From the weapons you use, to the crazy suits of armor, all the way down to the architecture of the buildings you explore, the game provides you with a realistic and believeable setting throughout the entirety of your playthrough. The character models look great as well. Mass Effect possesses possibly the most believable dialogue sequences that have been seen in any game to date, this is due in large part to the realistic way in which the character’s mouths move as they speak. This allows for deeper dialogue within cut scenes. More importantly, it allows the characters within Mass Effect to express some true personality, which makes it easy for the player to truly connect to his party members as well as truly despise his enemies. Needless to say, the excellent visuals in Mass Effect provide a more than sufficient backdrop on which to tell the epic tale of the game. Among all of these glaring successes, there is really only one significant problem with the graphics in Mass Effect, and that is the delayed rates at which they sometimes appear. Occasionally, during quick transition cut scenes such as your ship landing on a planet, the graphics will lag behind a bit, causing everything to look sort of like the same drab color of gray for a few moments. For example, when your ship is coming in to a landing port, the graphics on the side of your ship will not appear for a few seconds, which makes your ship look like a generic blob of gray. Your armor will occasionally suffer from the same syndrome, in which case its usual fine tuned appearance will be replaced with one continuous, smooth looking color that mysteriously engulfs your character. This is a bit difficult to explain in type, but if you have played this game already, I’m sure that you have encountered a similar problem and can identify what I am talking about. It’s really not a major problem, however it did cause my Xbox to make that terrible “kick it into gear noise”, which always seems to cause some discomfort. This screenshot provides a good sampling of what you can expect from Mass Effect graphically. Gameplay - Gameplay wise, Mass Effect is not your typical RPG, and that is most definitely a good thing. In the past, BioWare’s RPG’s have alienated many potential fans who criticized the combat systems they had implicated in their games. Many gamers did not like the fact that they were not truly performing the attacks of their characters, a perfect example of this is found in the KOTOR series, in which the player merely selects a target and presses an attack “command” button, which pretty much made your character run over to the enemy you indicated and slash away at him until your commands told him to do otherwise. This did not irk hardcore RPG fans such as myself, but for many people, it was a solid reason for them to pass up on the game altogether. However, BioWare has remedied this problem in Mass Effect, and these critics should be pleased with the changes that have been made. This time around, BioWare has basically included a Gears of War style third-person shooter to serve as the game’s combat sequence. This comes as a pleasant, and relatively overdue change for a genre that has been plagued far too long by the dull turn-based styled JRPGs which seem to dominate the industry. Don’t get me wrong, I love me a good JRPG just as much as the next guy, but a system like that of Mass Effect’s appeals to me much more than does the now cliché, and seemingly archaic system that is turn-based combat .  There was a lot of to-do about the conversation system in the game, but for anyone who has played BioWare’s previous Xbox games (namely KOTOR or Jade Empire), you will quickly realize that the conversation system is basically the same as it was in those titles, it just got a little fancier. The only real change within the new system is that Shepard (Your main character), doesn’t exactly say the words you select word for word. By picking what to say during the dialogue portions of the game, you’re basically picking what message you want to convey to the person you are conversing with. For example, you may select the option for Shepard to say “I don’t like you”, but instead of saying that exact phrase, he will instead come out with something like “I’m losing my patience with you offworlder.” This provides for some frequent accidental insults in the course of conversation, but it also makes the process a little less brainless than it has been in the past by forcing the player to put a little more thought into what he selects to say. Other than the combat gameplay and the subtle modifications to the conversations, Mass Effect does not alter the RPG formula too drastically, but once again, this is not necessarily a bad thing. Everything in the game runs very smoothly, and you shouldn’t encounter any significant problems on your way through.  Controls - This will probably be the shortest of the four sections because Mass Effect doesn’t really do anything crazy with the controls. During combat is the only time where the controls may change up a bit. During these segments the controls are very similar to Gears of War, you hold A to sprint, press left trigger to aim the right trigger to fire, etc. The controls are pretty responsive and they shouldn’t really cause any problems as you play.  Story - The story of Mass Effect is easily its strongest quality. I have no qualms with saying that it is by far the most appealing story that I have ever encountered in a game. The story is the driving force that keeps the player coming back to the game time and time again. You will want to defeat the next planet, not just to get the next party member, but also to get to the next cut scene, to witness the next plot twist, and to advance the story that always seems to be escalating toward something truly special. The story is what manages to keep the game interesting till the very end. Even the side quests have intriguing plotlines. It would be difficult for you not to get the “Completionist” achievement (which is awarded for completing the majority of the game) on your first play through . This is because you will most likely complete many of the side quests not just to be an achievement whore, but because you genuinely are intrigued by the quest, and want to complete it as such. The ability to create the look of your character seems to personify the entire experience. You can understand your character better if you create him, and that is exactly what Mass Effect allows you to do. Upon beginning the game, you are faced with a screen like the one below, which allows you to mold the unique look of your character.  Then, as you play through the game, you will mold your character’s personality through a system that hardcore BioWare fans should be fairly familiar with by now. Much like the way KOTOR handled Force Orientation, your alignment will shift between Paragon and Renegade status, depending on how you communicate with the characters of the game. This alignment will determine how people respond to you in the game, and it will influence the ending of the game as well. In short, this character customization, coupled with the solid group of characters that will accompany you on your quest across the galaxy, greatly enhance the story, and the quality of the game as a whole. Final Thoughts - If I were to sum up this entire review in a few words I would say this: Go buy Mass Effect, now. It is a step forward for the RPG genre and video games as a whole. It is a can’t miss for any gamer and in my opinion, the shining gem of possibly the greatest year the game industry has ever seen. I can assure you this , you won’t be disapponted.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Valve has done it again; they have created a masterpiece of a game. The team in Bellevue, Washington has created a truly magnificent multiplayer first-person shooter worthy of the highest accolades for its near perfect balance between its nine distinct classes (of which are the Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, and Spy), its wonderful cartoon-like graphical style, and its outstanding and addicting gameplay. I have spent over 200 hours with the game since its beta launch in September and there has never been a dull moment. Even when there are only two or three people in the server you\\'re playing in, there can still be loads of fun to be had by just goofing off with melee weapons and character taunts. But the real fun comes when playing with a full team of 12 to 16 players that knows what they\\'re doing and acts like a team. Playing on a team with true chemistry is one of the most satisfying feelings in the world, especially as you plow through their defenses on cp_dustbowl. This feeling is more than worth the measly $20 it costs to purchase this magnificent game. If you haven\\'t already, you need to buy this game. It\\'s $20 on Steam or at retail; the game is also included in The Orange Box, which is $40 on Steam.\"Gentlemen.\"',\n",

       "  'description': 'Presentation - 10Everything in this game has a real nice polish to it, and the presentation is no different. The cinematics are front and center once again but this time they mean business with the story line as this is supposed to be the last in the MGS series. The story starts you out 5 years after the events of Sons of the Patriots in the middle east where it’s a raging battlefield. Otacon is once again supporting you and he has a little Metal Gear Mark II that he controls. You learn that you’re mission is to find an operative to give you a location to find your enemy. As the story progresses you learn that your operative was FOX-HOUND led by Meryl and that the main enemy is Liquid that you must kill. From here on out it’s a crazy chase around 5 different locations including Shadow Moses from the first PS1 game. Kojima promised us that this will be the last Metal Gear Solid game and that all the crazy storylines will by answered by the end of this game. Well he wasn’t lying not only does this manage to tie all the loose ends but it’s a thrill ride all the way through. To anyone who’s never liked the over the top story and outlandish characters, they will probably not change their minds about it. It’s pretty much the same as the other ones, but that’s not a bad thing at all. The cut-scenes are long, the voice-acting is superb and it’s a visual masterpiece. The in-game HUD resembles the one in MGS3 but has the same functionality seen in the other titles. The radar is noise based and made possible with the Snake Eye. The weapons and items selector is still the clicking wheels in the lower side corners. You get a wind-direction arrow and compass in the top right corner. The main menu looks great and features Snake in the background at a funeral. There’s 4 different difficulties to choose from when you’re first playing, Liquid Easy, Naked Normal, Solid Normal and Big Boss Hard although The Boss Extreme gets added when you complete the campaign. I chose Solid Normal on my first play through, there’s 5 acts to complete and you can expect to spend 15-20 hours finishing MGS4. If you’ve played any of the other MGS games, it’ll be a big plus for you as a bunch of things happen that are totally fan services. You’ll already be familiar with the characters, you’ll know more about the back-story and act 4 is totally for us MGS1 fans. The 4 Beauty and the Beast bosses are throwbacks to the old cast present in the first and second titles. Let’s not forget the final boss is totally what needed to happen for MGS fans, best story ever from beginning to end!Graphics - 10These are the best graphics on a console game period. This is not the first time Metal Gear has accomplished this, they were always amongst the best looking games for their time periods. Saying this though we always have to points out some negatives which are minor. Some textures look lower-res in spots of the game, the frame rate does drop at some moments but they don’t occur often enough to really notice it. The cut-scenes are all in-engine so you can expect to watch a long cinematic and not have to load up after. These cut-scenes look as good, if not better then pre-rendered ones. Lip syncing is top-notch and facial expressions are fantastic. I would pay to watch this as a movie in the theaters, it’s that nice to look at. The actual in-game graphics also are stunning. Guns have nice muzzle flashes, the stun grenade’s effect looks great and pretty much every weapon has an outstanding graphical flare to them, not to mention the extraordinary explosions. Snake’s animations are fluid and realistic, they tie together nicely. The facial details are extremely well done, no character looks worst then the other. The hair flows in the wind, as does clothing, making the game look even more fantastic. The snow effects look amazing, it actually gets stuck on Old Snake. Sound - 10The sound excels in MGS4. The returning cast has their voice-actors reprising their roles, David Hayter, Snake’s voice is of course still here and thank god! Let’s talk about the voice-acting first of all, there’s a bunch of it for starters. Otacon is back giving you instructions along the way, which is fantastic, and Colonel Campbell is back as well. If you’ve ever played any of the other Metal Gears, you’ll know already that having these characters return pretty much guarantees pure gold in terms of acting. It’s like watching a theatrical movie release although it’s a PS3 video game. Not only are the cinematics a joy to listen to, but you also have your codec that allows you to communicate in-game with Otacon, Rose and Drebin. They give you hints as to what to do, but they also have alot of funny stuff to tell you like when you call them from inside a cardboard box. The visual flair from all the weapons are also equally represented in audio, the rifles sound spectacular, the pistols well done and explosions are epic. The menu cues and sounds are exactly the same as the other games, which is totally nostalgic at this point and there’s nothing wrong with that, if anything it’s awesome that those are still here. The soundtrack truly is epic, and mixes in with the emotion perfectly, sometimes the music alone will get you pumped up or calm you down. Gameplay - 10The gameplay was always second pony to the outlandish story line, but that is not the case for this title. As for how crazy the story actually is in this game, it’s matched by the gameplay. Controls have been simplified since Snake Eater and not much requires you to press 2 buttons, outside from aiming and shooting and changing from first person view to over the shoulder view. So in that sense it’s much improved over the 3rd in the series. Another major change in the game is the fact that it’s more open for you to choose how to play the game. It’s still mostly focused on stealth as it gives you bonus Drebin points (the game’s currency, used for buying guns and accessories) at every ending of acts for killing less enemies and being spotted less. But you can still run and gun in this game which the other games didn’t encourage. The gun play in this game is very visceral and satisfying, the kickback feels intense and the Dual Shock 3 support actually helps it. There’s less emphasis on close quarters combat this time around, it’s in there but you only really need it once in the entire game, which can lead to confusion once you’re actually there. The boss fights are exciting to say the least, while they aren’t exactly the hardest in the series, they are action packed and can last for a while. They’re all completely different from each other and some of them require puzzle element skills. The best act for gameplay and bosses has to be the fourth, so once you’re there, get ready for some action packed sequences and crazy boss battles. Fun Factor - 10The fun factor is superb, even if you’ve never played the others in the series, the main story-line is not totally disconnected from the other games but explains itself in a matter that doesn’t need past experience. The controls like stated earlier have been refined and tuned to perfection. There’s some re-playability here but not much, the story and gameplay paths are pretty linear as far as branching off goes. Another thing that adds to the fun for me is to see what classic Metal Gear references were in there, every time I saw something I either laughed, cried or jumped for joy. The online is functional but not too exciting, you get to customize your character, weapons and stats. Saying this it’s kind of limited to what you get to do, for example you only get a set number of faces to chose from, set limit of voices and so on. It seems this was just developed by Konami to suck more money from you as it seems you’ll be able to buy new items and characters later on. The online is there for whomever enjoys it, personally I always thought the online in MGS games was sub-par compared to the campaign although this time around it’s definitely more enjoyable. Overall - 10Metal Gear Solid 4 is an amazing looking game with a unmatched story, epic cinematics and superb gameplay. This game is unlike anything we’ve ever seen.Check out megascorcher.com if you liked this review.',\n",

Capture the flag is pretty much any capture the flag in any game, and control points is where you find your enemys control points and stand on them to slowly capture them. If one team has all control points, they win. Every class is balanced, like the heavy class deals a lot of damage, but is ridiculously slow, and is slower while firing. There is no such thing as a hunted class. And valve keeps patching in new modes and weapons. You can get new weapons by getting a certain amount of achivements for the class.

       " {'deck': 'Half Life 2 review by Termite',\n",
       "  'description': \"Game Review: Half Life 2Half Life 1 was released in 1998 ( A year of note for the sheer number of fantastic games that came out .) Developed by Valve and published by Sierra, it was a smash hit. It pioneered scripted in-game events that helped move the story around. It also spawned a large modding community, from which games like Counter Strike and Day of Defeat were born. Half life 2 was in the making for a long time, mostly because Valve wanted to wait for some huge innovative thing that they could do with the game. That thing, ended up being physics. A link to some history about Half Life 2's development will be provided at the bottom of the page.Let's start with a bit on the story. You are Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist who saved the world from the Xen in the original Half Life. Now the world has been taken over by the Combine, an alien race with immense power. Blah blah blah and then you are helping the human rebels destroy the Combine. You're character is the very definition of 'Tabula Rasa', as in blank slate. He says nothing during the entire game, which Gordon sometimes gets comments for. But really what it is intended to do is to suck you into the game and make the player feel like YOU are Gordon Freeman, which it does splendidly.The story is great, the world you are in has lots of detail and little things about it that can really immerse you.The graphics were top of the line when it came out, and fare very well even in this day and age. Physics are simply superb, with things acting realistically, and the physics itself actually plays a roll in the gameplay at numerous occasions. Obviously the graphics aren't as good as the games made on the optimized and upgraded version of the Source engine such as Team Fortress 2, but that's made up for in it's gamplay depth and personality.The game is a first person shooter, like every other game I've reviewed so far. The HUD, as in Heads Up Display which shows you your armor status and ammunition, is in my opinion the best of any game out there. The reason why I think this is that it is just so simple. Why don't other games think of that? It is very very stripped down and simplistic, but at the same time has sort of a slick style to it. 10/10 for the HUD, which is a similar style to that used in Counter Strike.The weapons feel good. You have your staples here, such as the pistol, sub-machine gun, assault rifle,shotgun and a crowbar (Not so standard.) And you also have some other odd weapons to accompany them. The difficulty is adjustable, which affects the strength of your guns as well as the enemy power. And as an aside, I have to say this games shotgun is my all time favorite of any shooting game, just because it is so cool looking.The AI is also great. At least when like, walking around and stuff. Fighting enemy AI isn't something you will notice much, it's good, but this isn't like F.E.A.R with the enemy squads acting all...well...squad like and ganging up on you and such. It's not so much the AI but the detail that they put into the environments that makes the enemies so great.And that brings us to the enemies. The things you are fighting all fit into the story and are very interesting. Some common ones are varieties of the Combine forces, who all look awesome. There are also Antlions which you encounter later in the game, and of course, headcrabs.The atmosphere in the game is perhaps it's best aspect, and that is saying a lot. You start out in the train station for City 17, the place you will be spending a lot of your time in. You see people pacing about, and if you try to talk to them they indicate that they know who you are, and that others do too. The voice acting in the game is very believable, especially from the Character Alyx Vance.And there is one weapon I didn't mention before because I wanted to dedicate a paragraph to it, the Zero-point gravity gun. It is basically the apotheosis of all physics that had ever been incorporated into games before Half Life 2. Using this gun you can levitate objects in front of you, and then shoot it away. Or if it is too heavy you can sort of push it. This thing is just a joy to use. You can use it as a deadly weapon as well by picking up sharp objects with it and shooting them at enemies.The sound in the game is captivating. From the fantastic voice acting from all the characters, to the shrill scream of the zombies, to the sound of exploding grenades this game delivers on all fronts when it comes to sound.Overall, the graphics, the sound, the atmosphere, the gameplay, everything is fantastic. The game is standard length for a shooting game but it has replay value just because of how good it is. If you haven't already played Half Life 2, I suggest you pick up the Orange Box so you can play this and the entire Half Life 2 series, you won't be disappointedAnd I think just for the fun of it I'm going to start applying scores to the things I review.5/5 \",\n",

       "  'description': \"Basically, the story is that our protagonist is Nathan Drake, descendant of the famous explorer Sir Francis Drake. The game starts out with Nate finding the lost diary of Sir Francis, in which he has explained the path to reach El Dorado. And throughout the story, you try to find this treasure. Along the way, meeting many characters ranging from Pirates to British villains...Gameplay-wise, it uses the same formula that Gears of War perfected. As soon as you get into a gunfight, you have to get behind cover, and just pop up from time to time to bust some pirates. There's no auto-aim, but the manual aim that is available is so smooth that I was actually glad that there was no Auto-Aim. The guns are what you would expect from any good shooter. A couple of semi-automatic pistols, a magnum, a couple different types of assault rifles, a sniper, and a grenade launcher.Being an action-adventure game, it does have platforming and exploring, etc. Though, one thing that bugged me was that there wasn't much freedom while exploring. There is always a linear path and you would have to be totally retarded not to know where you're going or how to reach your destination.Now, the best part of the game. The visuals. I was playing this on an SDTV, and I was still WOW'ed by the graphics. Everything looks so magnificent! Nate actually looks wet after he gets out of the water. The water actually ripples when swim in it. It bounces when you shoot in it.The fire and smoke effects are equally as mind-boggling! The small shrubs/branches of trees actually move because of the wind. And's it not one up-&-down movement. It totally depends on how strong the wind is blowing.The visuals are so good, you'll actually feel that you're traversing through a lush jungle yourself!The story, acting, and dialogue is really good. I mean, you'll actually care about what happens to these characters by the end of it. For me, there wasn't a line that I felt was very cheesy. The story is very fluent. The cutscenes aren't the only thing that keep the story flowing. The comic and humor in the lines keep the atmosphere from feeling tense.Apart from the usual gun and climb, the game slows the pace down at times by making you ride jet-ski's against the current of the river while oil barrels are coming towards you and pirates are shooting at you with AK's. Or, there will be a part where your partner and hottie, Elena Fisher, will be driving a jeep and you'll be in the back shooting cars chasing after you using a turret. It's mad fun and beautiful when when pirates go down when their cars blow up... O_OFor those of you who have played the game, comments?For those who haven't played the game, think that you might be interested?\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Over the years many superhero games hit the market. As they come and go they seem to just be another attempt to advertise there latest movie. With not much ambition actually coming forth in the games; this time it’s different though, there back, with the ultimate alliance.  Marvel Ultimate Alliance is a hard hitting superhero RPG. You assemble your team of up to four superheros from a series of Marvel franchises. Then take the action to the extreme. You can switch between your selected four heroes at any time in the game, just by hitting a direction on the D-pad. Certain battles call for different heroes to put there best foot forward. So don’t think you will be keeping the same formation for the entire game. The game begins as your onboard the S.H.I.E.L.D hellicarrier as it begins to get attacked by Dr Doom and his minions. But before you have much time to do anything the game throws you straight into the action. You begin to fight of the waves of minion as you reach the control room to see Nick Fury and find out what is happening on board. Before long the plot unveils and you make you way through the world uncovering secrets, traps, boss battles, unlock new heroes and find the true meaning behind Dr Doom’s evil plan.  Activision really hit a long awaited homerun with this title. You begin with the team of Spider-Man, Wolverine, Captain America and Thor. As you progress through the opening battle you reach an S.H.I.E.L.D Access Point. These allow you to change you team, save game and Extract yourself to base. There are several of these throughout each level. So no needs to worry about what team you pick at the beginning of each segment; you have plenty of opportunities to change your team as you progress.  You will have a fair selection of heroes to choose for your team, so you shouldn’t have any trouble forming the team that mostly suits your style of play. There are 20 heroes to choose from. Heroes such as Wolverine, Captain America, Spider-Man, Hulk, Cyclops, Venom, Storm, Thing, Iron-man, Dr Doom, Spiderwoman and much more. When your team consists of certain heroes it triggers a team bonus. For instance if you have all members of the X-Men in your team you will get a bonus, these bonus’s can be anything from 10% extra damage to “coin multiplier”. Coins are another way to power up your hero. You can exchange your coins to power up attacks etc.  At first glimpse this game wouldn’t come across as a RPG game. But as you play you realise your characters level up as you gain Experience points (XP). You can gain XP from enemies you have defeated or answering Trivia questions at your head quarters. The higher your level the easier and less shots it will take to kill a enemy or defeat a boss. So levelling up is key to success. But as you alter your team you may change you’re levelled up hero for a hero which hasn’t been levelled up at all. Thus making level progression harder; so remember to plan ahead.  Once the story mode ends in this game, it is by no means the end of the game. You go back to main headquarters and then have access to go to any mission again and play through it again. Or play through some training simulators to unlock some more outfits, scavenge for coins and find unlockables such as action figures which can unlock more heroes to use at your desire. This game is also a very online friendly game. This allows you and 1-3 other players to team up online and go through and tackle story mode together. You can also help each other level up and go through the training missions together to unlock more outfits for your characters.  Overall this is a very enjoyable game and should not be underestimated by any Xbox360 owner. It has so much potential for a sequel and has superb graphical limits. The replay value is also the very attractive/compelling thing about Marvel it is great value for money. Which modern day games seem to lack.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Crackdown is one of the very few free-roaming games that takes the sandbox formula and almost re-invents it entirely, fusing multiple types of gameplay together to form a game of one of its kind. Simply put, Crackdown is one of most fun experiences a sandbox game has had to offer in recent history.  The one thing that might come surprising about Crackdown is how fast it drops you straight into the game, you have your basic main menu that of course lets you decide what you want to do, but the main mode, campaign mode, is really all there is from the get go. Crackdown lacks any real in-depth story, all that is needed to know, is that the futuristic metropolis that is pacific city is overrun by gangs, and its your job as a super-agent (yes, super-agent) to clear out those gangs, and that just about sums it up, Crackdown is more of a freeform sandbox game than a huge story-driven adventure and that only helps bring the game down, and as a result, leaves Crackdown feeling a little shallow at parts, but all that really matters is the fun and intense action Crackdown has to offer.  You play as one of eight agents, but these aren’t your average agents, they have 5 key adaptive skills that evolve over the course of the game, these skills are; Agility, Driving, Explosives, Strength and Shooting. These 5 skills are pretty much the 5 main cores of action in Crackdown. In pacific city there are 3 main gangs that rule over 3 unique territories, and by taking out the 21 unique gang bosses and wiping out a gang completely, you will gain skill points depending on how you take down the enemy, for instance just shooting a guy will improve your shooting abilities, and using explosives will improve you explosive abilities, its actually a really clever way of advancing through the game in your own way and adds to the free-from play that Crackdown does so well, as these skills improve you will see a dramatic change in your characters appearance: new facial features, hair, a bigger build ect. and of course the parameters of that said skill such as bigger explosions from explosives and precision targeting enabling you to aim better shots. The skill system is really what separates Crackdown from the rest of the Free roaming games to come out in recent history and instantly the one of the best features Crackdown has to offer.  With the agility skill the world becomes more “open” then any other free-roaming game, its basic benefit to you is the ability to jump great heights and run at super fast speeds, this enables you to get from place to place really easily instead of having take long journeys and getting hopelessly lost. There is a lot of verticality to the environment so climbing up to the top of a skyscraper is not only fun, but it opens a whole new world of transportation, you can jump from building to building like some sort of superhero and that’s probably some of the most fun you will have playing crackdown. Increasing your agility is a lot of fun too, there 500 agility orbs scattered around the world and they are all situated at high places (of course), in addition to those, there are rooftop races which test your jumping abilities in a series of checkpoints, these races are a nice thing to get sidetracked on but unfortunately, these are pretty much the only distractions from the main game. There are some surprisingly high places to scale and climb though, and the games impressive draw distance only makes climbing a building that more exciting.  Of course there is another mode of transportation, but in all fairness you’d be better off just sticking to jumping, the car handling is pretty mediocre even when the driving skill is maxed out the civilian cars handle like garbage, but the gang cars step it up a little, they tend to have a little more power under hood and therefore feel more responsive, but in hindsight, the agency cars at your disposal are what you should be using, as your driving skill increases by doing races and mowing gang members down, your agency cars will take a dramatic transformation, similar to your character changing appearance, whereas that is primarily aesthetic, these changes improve the power and abilities of the cars accordingly, not only do these cars improve, but your overall car handling is increased, even though the civilian cars are pretty much rendered useless to you throughout the game. You will be stuck for choice however, Crackdown has an interesting variety of vehicles, and while there aren’t any bikes or boats, you will find a variety of compacts, sedans, SUV’s and even armoured vehicles, and with your super strength these cars become instant weapons.  The combat in general is great, the 3 main components that consist of the combat are using the objects around the environment, shooting and using explosives. One of the impressive features is the ability to pick up and throw practically every object you can find in the city, whether that’s a trashcan or a 2 ton truck is totally up to you and down to your strength skill, throwing these objects at gang members will not only feel gratifyingly good, but it will also improve the skill, and when that happens, you’re able to throw things at a much larger scale and take more damage. All of the objects deform and break really well: lids flying off trashcans, concrete tiles breaking into loads of pieces ect. and all of the parts that do break apart can also be picked up and thrown, and its all down to the impressive havok engine that creates a huge amount of possibilities, however there are some technical issues with actually picking the objects up, if an object is tucked away in a corner or is in an awkward spot, the command to pick things up will not always immediately show up and end up leaving you venerable while desperately trying to grab an object. If using the environment as a weapon was not enough for you, then there is always your super strong kicks at your disposal, you can literally send objects flying at a tap of a button, so there’s never a dull moment to be had in Crackdown.  The shooting element is just fine, but as with all the skills you start off pretty weak, and since you are using a gun you would probably assume that that’s all you ever probably need, guess again, even with the strongest firearm skills, gang members do not go down easily unless you cap a solid headshot, even when using precision targeting, enemies still take a while to die, but the neat thing with the precision targeting, is the ability to shoot specific parts of the body or car, so undermining a targets mobility whether it’s a car or a person, is easy. Crackdown has a good set-up of weapons, you‘ve got your SMG‘s, sniper rifles, handguns, your usual line up of weapons, there isn’t necessarily a huge amount, but it’s evident a lot of care was taken into the overall design on some of the later firearms you will acquire, but for the most part, they all resemble modern weaponry used today, and the Explosive weaponry is just as fun as the standard shooting, similar to practically every other skill, using explosives to kill gang members is the way to improve it, and once improved, there’s never a chance of being bored because utter chaos awaits at the end of one single grenade. With all these skills in hand, you would think that there’s no way anyone can stop you, but you’d be wrong, Crackdown throws in enemy after enemy at you left, right and centre, and there’s no stopping the action at all, its damn right chaos from the get go, but its undeniably fun, you’ll notice a ton of random events occurring, from gang wars to civilians defending themselves, it just keeps going on and brings up the replay value to an insanely high amount.  Most free-roaming games will always try to create “a huge breathing, living world”, that bold claim can only be heightened even further with a developer name like “Realtime Worlds”, and the good thing is, they’ve done just that. The world has been designed beautifully, it may be a little smaller than what you would come to expect from most next generation games but for what it lacks in width, it makes up for in height, and there is no shortage of high places to go. There is a surreal variety to the environment, one minute your in suburbia, the next, in a rocky countryside, what makes this surreal is the distance between the two, its all very compact and is not initially perceived to be there, but it is, and its great. The civilians are just as impressive as the world is, there is a lot of them on screen at once, you do get the sense that the world is definitely breathing and most certainly living, they will say some great stuff, trouble is its hard to hear them, the game has a bad unbalance with sound effects, there is an option to make the quite noises louder, but still, civilians sound far too quite, but only when they are talking at least, you can pretty much hear their screams of terror all the time, which is always a welcome notion that something bad is going on, but it would be nice to hear their comments a little more clearly.  One voice that will never seem to be quiet is the disembodied voice that is the agency director, at first he seems really appropriate for the style of the game, but eventually he will just get on your nerves, his main goal is to show you the ropes and give you certain Intel, he’ll make a few comments here and there and generally just try to help you out in certain situations, but when you practically know everything, there’s no reason for him to carry on, he will cut down on some obvious comments but for the most part he really is unnecessary towards the end and makes tons of mistakes based on your location among other things.  Crackdown isn’t the hardest game of all, while the later difficulty levels do get hectic, the main incentive of the game isn’t a total challenge, sure the later bosses do get harder, but you could rush through the entire game fairly quickly without having too much trouble. Thankfully the enemy AI is pretty good, if you get too close they will use the objects in the environment as weapons giving you a taste of your own medicine, and they wont hesitate to use heavy weaponry at a distance either, there are some rough spots though, they wont entirely notice you from some angles, but rest assured, they will get more aggressive as time goes by.  One of the big parts of Crackdown is blowing stuff up, and its only fitting that they look exceptionally good, from black smoke pluming from a car explosion, to a burst of flaming bodies and debris flying through the air, you wont be disappointed when something blows up. With the mix of cell shading and textures, the graphics feel totally unique and add such a character to Crackdown, it has such a great draw distance on the landscape its breathtaking, sadly as far as cars and certain other objects are concerned , the draw distance isn’t so good. that’s not the only graphical blemish Crackdown has, cars will disappear quickly if you look away for just a second, and sometime cars just fail to show up at all and leave the driver floating in mid-air, also, when the physics are pushed to the limits in an explosion for example, the framerate can dip and can get messy, but other than that the game runs at a solid framerate throughout.  With a great visual experience comes a great audio experience, the soundtrack for Crackdown is surprisingly bad, there are a huge amount of tracks, sad thing is it’s a huge bunch of tracks from artists you may have never heard of, you can look at that any way you want, but it is a disappointment nonetheless, this doesn’t mean the music itself is bad, it actually pretty good varied music. Apart from the fact that the soundtrack in Crackdown is somewhat poor, the sound effects emitted from gunfire and explosions is spot on perfect, the explosions are so loud you’ll have to prepare your ears for it, overall the audio experience Crackdown has is really something special.  Crackdown has a interesting set of achievements, they vary in difficulty but are all easily achieved to some extent, some achievements don’t even have any points tied in with them, they simply are just another way of building your skills which is a first for an Xbox 360 game, the achievements are really unique as the rest of the game is, “body juggler” is just a glimpse at the creativity Realtime Worlds has put into the achievements.  Crackdown is just one of those games you wont forget anytime soon, in fact, you will take a lot of the things you can do in Crackdown for granted, when playing any other game of the same calibre you will feel the need to jump 30 feet, use objects as weapons and generally cause as much mayhem as possible, but you will find you can’t, or not as well as you can here, and that’s when it becomes apparent, that Crackdown is truly a game of one of its kind. Crackdown is a must have for anyone who likes the genre, but more specifically to anyone who has gotten bored of the free-roaming experience previous games have had to offer.  ~Death Burnout \\t\\t',\n",

       " {'deck': 'GTA IV Review',\n",
       "  'description': 'Presentation - 10The story in GTA IV is the best video game story you’ll play ever. In case you don’t know the basics already, you’re an immigrant called Niko, fresh off the boat to meet up with your rich and luxurious cousin Roman. Quickly Niko finds out this was all a lie and Roman actually just lives in a dump apartment and owns a taxi company. It spans from many different characters to culminate with one of the most epic decisions you’ll ever have to make in gaming. The cinematic cut-scenes are produced in classic GTA fashion although the production value of IV is equal or even superior to those of big budget movies. The lip-syncing is done fantastically, it’s unbelievable that all this is done with the in-game engine. Niko is the most like-able Grand Theft Auto character ever, for the simple fact that he seems to have more human qualities then any other protagonist in a GTA game. He gets mad, has past history to think about and overall just has more emotion then any other character in previous games. Graphics - 9.5 The graphics are the best ever seen in any sandbox\\\\open environment game. The characters look and animate fantastic, with only minor glitches such as the feet pointing upwards in specific situations, although it happens enough that it’s noticeable. The running animation has been improved upon greatly since last generation GTAs, you also lean when you do turns while you run. With every GTA comes clipping, pop-ins and various other graphical glitches, and GTA IV is no exception. This being said, it’s definitely the most polished in terms of the typical hitches that happen. The only real pop-ins I’ve noticed while playing was going between the islands while others seemed to occur randomly. The draw distance is really far and while flying a helicopter, you can see across all 3 islands. The vehicle damage looks super nice, the first car I drove in the first 3 seconds of being in it, I rubbed off something and it left scratches on the paint. Hitting a pole straight in the middle of the bumper will put a huge dent right where you hit. Rolling over will also put some damage on the roof, but will not cave in completely, the windows break nicely though. The explosions look respectable, the real problem with them is there’s not enough. Flipping over the car will no longer make your car explode, and one of the most epic explosions in the game happens within 3 hours of play time. Sound - 10 As usual Rockstar hit the nail square on the head in the audio department. All the radio stations are unique and of course, will depend on personal taste regarding which you’ll listen to. Lazlow is back and produced the audio for every station, he also appears on Integrity 2.0. Integrity is a station where Lazlow is on the streets of Liberty City interviewing citizens with hilarious outcomes. The sad thing is that I seemed to have heard all of it while playing through. I listened to Liberty Rock Radio and Liberty City Hardcore for my music fix and I was still discovering new songs near the end of the game. Although the DJ and commercials were getting repetitive near the third quarter of gameplay. The sound effects are amazing, they sound just like their real life counterparts. Peeling out with a car sounds really cool and depending on your vehicle, it’ll also differ in sound. The weapons are great, no complaints and I’m sure you all know what guns sound like, well this title pulls it off with grace. The voice-acting is done terrifically and you’ll encounter many different characters with diverse styles and cultures. Amazingly with all the various styles of voice-acting none of them are done bad, sure some are better then others but when isn’t it. The pedestrians also have dialogue, some are just normal conversations but most have a funny twist on them. Gameplay - 10 The gameplay is what was always the best part of GTA. I really don’t know what to say that would be unexpected about this title. You rob cars, kill people, drive and run around. The biggest alteration that actually makes a difference is the cover system, now you can hug up against a wall and blind fire some bitches or pop out and accurately head shot some enemies. The aiming system has also changed, you can shoot from your car similar to Saints Row. Auto-aiming was added as well, the option can be turned off but is a valuable asset, but it’s sort of picky with who it aims at. Sometimes I found myself face to face with someone and it would aim at a random guy in the distance. Everything else that made the other games great are all here, with minor adjustments like the driving physics feels more realistic, yet still cartoony. There’s a big social aspect to GTA IV, you get to make friends, girlfriends and work buddies. There’s advantages to do man-dates and dates. The man-dates are very crucial as once you get to a certain point of friendship, they’ll offer you stuff, such as Roman’s car service will be free. The dates only get you in the sack with them and well it’s virtual sex so who cares. Fun Factor - 9.5 The online is flawed, it might only be my personal taste but I dislike it. I thought the map was far too big to enjoy any of the modes, seeing as the maximum amount of players is 16. There’s a mode that you have to steal marked vehicles and bring them to specific locations. If you just wait it out a bit to see where the other players are going, you could just take the one that no ones’ near for an easy point. Also the pop-in appears to get worst when playing online, I found myself crashing often in cars that popped up right in front of me. The length of the main story is around 30 hours, plus all the side missions could lead you to a game that would last forever. This is the first GTA game I completed, as I thought all the others got repetitive fast. The difference between this one and the others, is there’s always one mission that is so epic in terms of story significance, that it makes you keep playing. You also get missions that’s kind of different from the others that it somewhat keeps it fresh, but mainly you’re still driving to point A, kill some guy, drive to point B. Overall - 9.8GTA IV is a cinematic masterpiece and an awesome value for your money, the online is flawed and there’s a few imperfections but none of them ruin the experience.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Game Review: Custom RoboCustom Robo for the Gamecube was released in North America on May 10, 2004 and is part of the long running Custom Robo series that is owned by Nintendo. While the game got a fairly negative response from several reputable game review sites, it seems to have done fairly well and a new Custom Robo game for the DS came out in March 19, 2007 (North American release)And I have to say, this game is pretty bad.You start out as a nameless character ( It\\'s one of those games where you name your character, we\\'ll just call him player for simplicities sake) who finds out his father has passed away. His father had left years ago and the kid is obviously saddened to hear his fate. And as any video game character worth his share of purple taffy (Confusing eh?) would do he sets out to become a commander, which is someone who commands Custom Robos) and make his name.But I haven\\'t explained what Custom Robos are yet have I? They are these super tiny robots which fight each-other in these tiny boxes called holosseum. A holosseum is basically just a tiny box that you throw on the ground and the two commanders put their little guys in the Arena to fight. This is all very confusing and to be perfectly blunt, doesn\\'t make the least amount of sense especially when you see police fighting criminals by throwing down a cube and using tiny robots to do battle. And then when the police officer loses he just gives up because the other guy has the advantage in that his tiny little robot which is no match for a human is still standing....yeah.Basically it makes about as much sense in me and you the reader getting into a fight and then I say \"Wait, let me get my rock-em sock-em robot kit\". You can see how odd that is right?Anyway, enough of that let us get onto the gameplay. It\\'s terrible. You see, I had convinced my parents to get me this game and I was all excited and once I had it and was playing it I was trying to convince myself that the game I was playing was fun. But it wasn\\'t. It is reminiscent of the days where there were no websites to tell you which games were good and which were bad, as I was not at the time using those sites. Since I was stuck with the game, I just had to keep on playing.The exploration part of the gameplay has you going around sometimes collecting items but usually going from one boring task to the next. This is interspersed with badly written conversations with other characters. And the combat part is just as bad. When the match starts you and your opponent aim this cannon which shoots out a cube in which your robot is contained. The cubes will both have a timer with a number from 1 to 6 on it which determines how long until your robot is released and ready for battle. You can speed up the process by pressing the A button. This system is really pointless and not fun at all, so I\\'m rather puzzled as to why they put it in.Also annoying is the \"Illegal\" weapon system. These Illegal weapons are sometimes used by your evil enemies and are far more powerful than regular one\\'s. However in certain events, one example being the score based trials you have to take to get the last unlockable robot, using these results in a serious penalty. This makes those last events a lesson in frustration and really serves no purpose than to bother you (Especially people like me who like to unlock everything in a game).And the basic combat itself is boring. After your robot is released from its cube prison thing you commence to run, jump, and sprint midair around the arena while permanently locked onto the enemy. Different models, guns, bombs, etc give your robot different degrees of power, speed, sprint and such but the basic combat always remains the same.You can unlock quite a few different robot\\'s to use in battle, all of which I managed to unlock (But I doubt you will take the time too, if you buy this game that is). The design of the robots is cool, possibly the only area of the game I actually liked. You have a small ball like robot with a cute little face, or a giant ape like one and so on. This doesn\\'t make up for the game\\'s other aspects but at least they got something right.The story is also bad, so I won\\'t even waste my time describing it.Overall, this game is one of the worst I\\'ve played in my entire life. I\\'m telling you right now, don\\'t buy this game. Buy the N64 version which although I haven\\'t played myself, I hear is quite good. Buying bad games only sends a message to the developers saying that you encourage them to make more like it, which is the exact opposite of what we all want.Custom Robo for the Gamecube rating: 1/5',\n",

       "  'description': \"\\tHalf Life 2: Episode 2 is the follow up to last year's Episode 1, and the third successive Half-Life 2 game. Complete with a slew of new enemies, environments, and game mechanics, Episode 2 is a more-than-worthy addition to the Half-Life saga, and likely the greatest of all.  \\tOriginally released as part of The Orange Box, and now available as a stand-alone game, Episode 2 chronicles the continuing story arc of Half-Life. The game begins not long after Episode 1 ended; Gordon and Alyx escape on a train out of City 17, moments before the Citadel erupts in some sort of cosmic firestorm, engulfing the surrounding area and sending a distress beacon in to space. In the interest of a learning curve, you start the game with only your gravity gun. It also serves a less obvious, secondary purpose; you are less likely to leave Alyx behind and miss anything she says. Incidentally, you'll find she is quite integral in the rest of the episode, as well.  \\tIf you've missed out on playing any of the recent Half-Life games, you'll get a good feel for the pacing and reoccurring themes of 'high-action followed by short, environmental puzzles, proceeded by more action'. Segments that have long since become old favorites – surviving against an onslaught of enemies as an elevator slowly descends or romping through abandoned roadways make a triumphant return. Fortunately, the driving sequences are spruced up in the form of a new vehicle; a muscle car that seems to have been brought to life with scrap metal. Like Episode 1, you'll spend the majority of the game accompanying Alyx, but her presence is handled so well in that she never detracts from your sense of being the story's hero. She provides clever insight and comments along the way, and provides cover during firefights, but never gets in the way or is occlusive.    \\tEpisode 2 also takes great strides in developing the characters and their relationship with Gordon. It's impossible to not like Alyx; she is such a gem in a genre that otherwise obscures over any semblance of character development. Alyx's faults are very endearing, and her relationship with her father, Eli, seamlessly weaves a second dimension into her character. The last hour of Episode 2 has a larger focus on the plot than the other segments of the game, but is handled in such a delicate manner that you cannot help but enjoy it. It is never heavy-handed or detracting from the experience, and always has a sense of humor about it. The lead up to the end pays off well; the stage is set for Episode 3, and the game finishes with a powerful climax.    \\tSoon after starting the game, you are introduced to the new scientist character, Dr. Magnusson, as well as the returning characters, Eli and Dr. Kleiner. Your goal is also quite clearly explained at this time – get yourself, and Alyx, to the new Resistance headquarters in White Forest.  There are a number of obstacles and events that sidetrack you from the main quest, but it all serves the story well and makes sense within the game. That is to say, I never felt like I was taking part in an arbitrarily lengthened game.    \\tThat being said, the end result of a game with no padding is a very short one; I finished Episode 2 in my first sitting with the game, which was no longer than four hours. It is hard to fault the game for this, however, as the quality is extremely high for those four hours. It is also worth noting that once I finished the game, I immediately wanted to play through it again. This is in part due to the fact that, whichever platform you buy the game for, – PC, Xbox360, or PS3, the game comes with achievements; one being a 'carry a garden gnome with you until the end of the game', which warrants its own play through simply for bragging rights.    \\tIt's coming up on four years since the original Half-Life 2 was released, and the source engine is perhaps showing signs of wear. Fortunately, the developers of Episode 2 reused almost no environments from the original, which was one of the major complaints about Episode 1. The game takes place in two major scene pieces – a dark, underground cave system, and a large North American-esque forest. Some perhaps 'dated' textures are always overshadowed by top-notch voice actors and an excellent original music score.  \\tEpisode 2 is another landmark game by Valve. For a bargain price of $15 on Steam, it is an unmissable game. Combine it with the other four full games in the Orange Box, you have an unbeatable game and no excuses to miss any of it.  \",\n",

       "  'description': 'This game had practically no hype until it was announced it would be bundled together with a beta test invitation for one of the biggest and most anticipated game in arguably the whole gaming world. Yet it stands as a good game none the less.  This game place\\'s you as a scientifically enhanced cop in the middle of a run down city. It is your duty to eradicate each and every criminal walking the streets and make it safe for the civilians to wander in the daily life. But this is were the problem arises, your primary objective is to of course clean out the city of criminals. So how would you fit this into a story line? Well Realtime has based the story not on levels but you explore the city and eliminate the gang leaders making it easier and increase the possibility of eliminating the Islands Kingpin. There are 18 gang leaders to search out spread out over three decent sized Islands. Then 3 KingPin\\'s running the Islands, which are securely hidden in the utmost confound of the Islands preliminary defenses. So finding them may not be as easy as first imagined. Which leads us to your Dossier; the Dossier is your communication between you and base. You will get a Dossier update whenever a gang leader is near or needs your attention. Showing you the general direction of those pesky gang leaders; this can be a life saver at times.  The graphics are what make\\'s this game feel truly next generation. It’s set out in a cartoon style with a sprinkle of pixel shading. The graphics from the ground are fairly standard but when you get your abilities up and begin to climb to the top of tall building you will notice there\\'s a nice scenery and atmosphere once the city has been restored to its peaceful state.  Crackdown has also been tampering with a little bit of the RPG side of things. With the abilities gauge which as you increase you grow levels which gets you stronger/faster or what this game is most famous for the extreme jumping skills. When your jumping ability is at max you can jump around 30ft at a time. This is more than the standard double story building!  It is one of the only game\\'s I have had the pleasure of playing that has this sort of physics system and still become a success. After the hugely hyped \"Hulk\" game becoming a flop, most would have thought casually jumping 30ft in a video game also died at that moment.  Another major downside to this game is the driving capability. When you first begin the game you will barely be about to slide around a corner while going at a high speed but as you grow your driving ability it will slightly improve. But not up to the par I am used to, sorry Real-time you let me down here. But when you do eventually get to do some insane stunts after you have been launched of a cliff in your little van you can do a lot of cool stunts, like back flips and barrel rolls. Which nearly make’s up for the lack of driving potential. Because if you cant even get up the ramp, what’s the point of being able to do all these insane stunts?  I guess not many people would choose to drive when you could easily go faster and have a lot more fun jumping from rooftop to rooftop....  The abilities are split up into 4 main categories (agility/driving/explosives/shooting). You can increase these skills by doing simple tasks such as shooting opposed gang members or driving through stunt markers, mainly just meeting requirements for the corresponding skill. As your agility level increases you can do better in each category such as shoot more accurate or jump higher. But it may take some dedication to bring all these abilities to the max.....  This game will last you about 20-40 hours if you have online and a friend who plays it also. Because online Co-op is the high point to this game; its sandbox with a friend. You’re in the city at the same time, exploring or helping each other with missions. Or even creating some games if you are imaginative.  But if you are willing to spend the money for possibly a game that will be completed in a few days then be gather dust in your collections. But this game would last you longer with a friend. But those hours you spend playing it will be a happy and extremely enjoyable one. So you may want to just rent it if the single player is all your interested in. But the online for so much more.......',\n",

As I went through the levels in single player, my feel for the game grew, and I started to really like it. The game really started to take off when my friend came over and we played. Earth Defense Force 2017 is AWESOME in co-op. Not saying on level with Gears of War when it comes to co-op, but, still, wow. When we finally put the game down that night, it was around 5 in the morning, and we had no idea. It's such a time melt, and I love it.

An agent who has just started work for UNATCO (united nations anti terrorist coalition). You are however, an agent with a twist.

       "  'description': 'Motorstorm was one of the very first games to be showcased on the PlayStation 3 and early previews already had gamers foaming at the mouths, then when game footage was released jaws drooped at its absolutely stunning visuals. Even now after months it’s still one of the best looking games around. From the impressive lighting effects and inspiring back drops, right down to the way the mud splatters up onto the screen and deforms the ground right in front of your eyes. Sure there are some horrid-looking textures thrown in and a few graphical glitches in spots but overall what Sony and Evolution Studios have done is provided us with a true feast for the eyes. However it is worth noting that those who still own a standard TV won’t feel the full force of the games graphical prowess unless they splash the cash on a shiny new HDTV.Unfortunately for all its visual might the game falls short in many areas. For instance you won’t find any trace of a storyline here and if you were looking for a selection of race modes you’ve come to the wrong place. Instead they focus on pure adrenalin-filled racing, flying through desert landscapes whilst smashing into anybody that stands in your way. While this is pretty fun for a period it soon becomes apparent just how shallow an experience it really is, with very few ways to play through the game.The single player mode is made up of various events or ‘tickets’ as the game refers to them, and as you complete these races you rack up points which then unlocks new vehicles and even harder tickets. Sadly there are only 21 of these tickets to play through and if you give the game your full attention you could breeze through them in three or four hours.The game offers you a choice of seven different vehicle classes, each handling radically different that the next. The bikes are light and agile, superb at jumps and turning yet small and fragile. The big rigs however are huge and bulky, turning like a ship out of water yet glide through the thick mud as quick as anything. The key is usually picking the right vehicle for the right situation, although sadly the game does like to force you to play as certain vehicles for certain races, this again takes away some of the games variety. The selection of vehicles within each class is also pretty limited and the changes from one to the next are, for the most part aesthetic.The tracks featured are all stunning and expansive to boot, offering multiple ways to tackle each one. Within every race track you’re bound to have high ledges and plenty of jumps for the bikes, ATV’s and buggies to tackle, hard flat surfaces for the rally cars to shoot across and large obstacle that only the heavier vehicles in the pack have any chance of smashing through. Unfortunately there are only eight courses to play through and after only a short time with the game you’ll already feel the repetitiveness creeping in.Apart from attempting to survive the treachery of the courses you’ll also need to be on full alert for your rival racers. These aren’t just along for the ride, pushing them or annoying them in any way will probably end up with you face-first into a wall or head-first over the nearest cliff. They also have a habit of ramming you from behind which spins you, knocking you off course onto terrain that you’re vehicle isn’t suited to. While this sounds like a welcome challenge it isn’t, it can make the game unbearably frustrating at times; not to mention extremely unforgiving. They don’t even make that many mistakes either, especially on the later levels and that’s when thing’s go from difficult to almost impossible. Only by mastering the courses for each vehicle and using your nitro boost effectively to the point of perfection can you win, even then it’s not guaranteed. It doesn’t matter how good you play most of the time as the majority of races are purely down to luck, then there are the restrictions set of you as a result of the rubber-band racing that has so clearly been incorporated, you can never get more than a few feet away from your rivals before they’re slamming you in the back and taking your position away from you.In addition to the games graphics the audio also does a pretty solid job. Every engine roars with passion and ferocity, every crash is met by a resounding boom and crunch as your vehicles are ripped apart. The only problem with this is you seem to hear your vehicle exploding even after the most minor of pings or scrapes. The soundtrack is filled with a mixture of rock and bass, with bands such as Nirvana, Wolfmother and Slipknot booming out over the frantic action. Sadly there isn’t a whole lot of variety here either and some of the songs start to get a little repetitive after only a few plays through.The online portion is a pretty fun experience, with up to twelve players able to race at any one time. There isn’t that much lag either, not when you consider just how many things are happening on the screen at any one time. Unfortunately there isn’t any sign of an offline multiplayer mode, this is extremely disappointing considering the single player portion is pretty short and one can only think they had issues with slowdown.All-in-all Motorstorm is a fantastic looking game with great game design and a whole lot of potential, sadly at times this can get overshadowed by agonizingly long loading times (sometimes taking up to 20 seconds just to load one vehicle), frustrating AI and extreme repetitiveness. There’s definitely a base here though which can be improved upon, and with a little care and padding around the edges this could be one to look out for in the future.UPDATE: The game now offers downloadable vehicle packs and a full time trial mode for it’s users via the PlayStation Network. These however aren’t free like they should be, not only did they give us a sub-par single player experience to begin with but now they want to charge us to enhance what should have been included in the first place.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Since Grand Theft Auto 3 made its grand entrance on the Playstation 2 in 2001, its free-roaming style of gameplay has been pasted into countless games, with varying success. What is becoming more and more obvious is that the inclusion of a sandbox is utterly pointless if there is nothing there to play with. With Burnout Paradise, Criterion is testing the Burnout wheels on the open-world tarmac. Do they handle it well, or simply spin out of control?Initially, the open city can feel overwhelming, and you will find the initial races pretty punishing. The open structure of the world makes knowing the roads a necessity, and although the game gives you a radar and blinking street-signs show you the way, these will not stop you from missing a turn over and over again. You will perhaps spend more time mid-race checking out your route than you’d like, but as you spend some time in Paradise City, it will be more friend than foe. After each passing hour, the wonderful design of the city becomes obvious, and finding hidden alley-ways and jumps will become pure enjoyment. It\\'s a beautiful town, and well worth exploring. The seamless integration of entering races at every intersection, driving through gas stations for boost and changing cars at junk yards all help to make the city a memorable place.The city is also worth seeing for its visuals. There is a genuine enjoyment in racing across Paradise City in warp speed as the cars fly by you and you make a quick turn into a alley-way hoping for the best. Each car has distinctive design, and although they are not licensed, they run the gambit from Porsche-look-a-likes to Japanese tuners. It also help that they all break apart with gripping detail and wonderful physics. If you remember the first time you saw a knockout in Fight Night Round 3, prepare to experience the same awe and wonder again. Each car has been modelled from the roll cage outwards, and breaks apart with amazing detail. Windows explode, metal crumbles, the bumper breaks apart; it all looks fantastic. Good camerawork also help making it a mindblowing experience each time. It doesn’t quite make you happy you crashed, but helps soften the blow for a few seconds.One thing that has not changed is the amazing speed and tight control of Burnout. When you drive at 200 mph it does feel as dangerous as it should, but thanks to tight arcade controls, each crash is usually the drivers fault and not the game. The cars all drive differently depending on weight and speed. The game lists 75 cars, although this number is somewhat misleading. Each car has its own time trial somewhere in the city. Finishing one of these events gives you a somewhat tweaked version of that ride. This is set as a new car, although the difference between them often minor. But the 30+ cars that are truly different there is plenty of choices to suit every type of driver. Emphasising this is the addition of classes. Aggression cars turn like tanks, but are the sturdiest of the bunch. Speed cars are fragile beings, but can make a run across the city like nobody’s business. They also use a personal boost system that can only be used once completely full, and can be stringed into continuous “burnouts”. And finally, the stunt cars have stats in the middle, but get the bonus of spinning faster and jumping higher for the stunt runs, which is one of the new events. They are arguably the most challenging of the events, since they require an intricate knowledge of your surroundings to keep the combo going. There are also point-to-point races, takedown challenges and survival, which is basically a reversed road rage, asking you to make it to a certain landmark without crashing to pieces. Considering there are 120 events, there is quite a bit of repetition. Add to that the fact that all events are reset once you get a new license, and it can get boring after a while. Should that be the case, going into Showtime should relieve some of that stress. Essentially a modified crash mode, it can be activated anywhere, and lets you frog-jump your car around to do the most damage possible on whatever road you are on. Although a fun diversion watching the carnage left in your wake, it lacks depth, and therefore also staying power. But something that have both is the game’s excellent multiplayer.In staying with the theme of seamless integration, the multiplayer shows up as a tiny menu while driving, and after only three clicks, up to 7 other people share the city with you. From here you can start your own races, go to particular funspots, or do challenges. Challenges are broken into 50 for each set of players (50 for two players, 50 for three players…). These range from crashing into each other to jumping to a certain locations and so on. There are tons of fun to be had here, and enough variation to last you for weeks. One problem is the focus on co-op in these challenges. It can sometimes be difficult getting 8 people to work together on a certain challenge, but when it does it is tons of fun. The problems online have, although more exposed due to the heavy weight on co-operation, are the same as any other online game, and nothing to be too concerned over. If you prefer competitions, it’s also possible to set up custom races and demolish the players that didn’t complete a challenge, just for the sake of stress relief. As a bonus when you take down another player in whichever mode, and they have a Live Vision Camera, you get a snapshot in your collection. The camera takes a picture of the player and puts it into your personal lineup, and it can be tremendous fun showing your collection off.With these features alone, the game is a absolute triple-A title. But what helps it making it something truly special is the details. They are hidden deep enough that even after hours of playtime, there are tons of fun to be had. The most obvious ones are the games 400 gates and 120 billboards that can be smashed and the 50 super jumps to be tracked down. Another great detail is how you get cars. When you win them, they spawn in the city, and you have to track them down and crash them to add them to the junkyard. They are never too far away and are exciting to hunt. One minor addition is power parking. The concept is simple; you see cars parked on the side of the road, with some open space between. Tap the e-brake and try to line yourself into their position without touching either car. It’s a fun addition and shows how much the developer love their game.  Soundwise, the game hasn\\'t changed all that much, although that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not top notch. The immense woosh when you hit the boost, the powerful roar of the engine of an agression car, and the sound of cars passing you by at breakneck speeds all help make the fast driving all that more intense. The soundtrack is a mixture of old and new. They have inluded some tracks that Criterion made themself in Burnout 2 and 3, and is arguably the best of the lot. The other tracks mostly consist of punk and more ordinary rock. It fits Burnout well, keeping the energy up at all times. Some standouts however are, ofcourse, Gun \\'n\\' Roses with \"Paradise City\" and Mozart. Why Mozart? Well, if you stand still for a few seconds, the camera starts to pan around the city in black & white and starts playing classics from composers like Chopin and the like. It\\'s great fun, and actually makes for a beautiful screensaver.With Burnout Paradise, Criterion has made a bold move with the Burnout series, and it definitely paid off. The open world is packed, but still with tons of room for experimentation, all wrapped around the excellent core of the Burnout we all know and love. Although it does take some time to properly establish itself, if you give it a few hours to settle in, it will give you weeks of fun in return.',\n",

       "  'description': \"BIOSHOCK    DEVELOPER: 2K GAMES.     The year is 1960. On board a plane flying across the Atlantic Ocean, you play as a faceless protagonist known as Jack. When the plane crashes into the sea, you take salvation by swimming ashore to a lighthouse. A mini submarine which takes you into the depths of the Ocean and you are greeted by an infomercial presenting to you the world of “Rapture”. In 1940's a man named Andrew Ryan invited the artists and intellects to join him in creating an underwater Utopia free from the suppressions of religions and the government. Yet as soon as you arrive in Rapture, you soon discover this world has slowly gone wrong.    You are soon contacted by radio by a unseen man named Atlas who may just be able to help you escape Rapture alive. It becomes apparent that Rapture is slowly falling apart under you and is infested with mutated people craving stem cell enhancements known as “Atom”: a substance that allows for genetic enhancements of the body. You will have to make use of the Atom powers and decide whether you are going to purge or save “the little sisters” of Rapture. These little girls, mutated by the effects of Atom collect the substance from the dead. Will you help them save Rapture? Or are you out to only save yourself?    Released for PC and the Xbox360, Bioshock was developed by 2K Games, which includes numerous talents such as Ken Levine who worked on System Shock 2. The influence and creativity from System Shock 2 is immediately evident in the intense and cinematic world of Bioshock. There are numerous narrative elements that will be immediately familiar such as mysterious voices instructing you on where to go, as well as haunting ghosts who retell poignant moments from a world that has slowly decayed. Yet despite these comparisons, Bioshock stands on its own merits and it is testimony to the art direction and wholly unique visual style that the game looks and feels like nothing you have played before.    Rapture was built in the 1940's and as such the game has been decorated authentically towards the era, with the appropriate furniture, music and textures delivering a world where every room is soaked in atmosphere. Enemies (or Splicers as they are known) look appropriately creepy with bloodied clothes and masks sheltering their scarred faces. They are intelligent enough in gunfights too with the ability to strafe, roll, flip and run when injured. They are able to search for health machines if necessary. They are never particularly tactical but you wouldn't expect them to be given they were once just ordinary people. The voice acting is superb throughout the entire game, with all enemies sounding appropriately angered and violent, while Andrew Ryan the creator of Rapture has a proud tone in his voice but perhaps too even guilt and remorse for what has happened. He was a man who had a vision for a better world and had to take drastic measures to try and preserve his ideals and values within Rapture.    Much of the story is conveyed through the voice of Atlas guiding you, as well as Ryan, occasionally interspersing his hatred of you, but there are also tapes everywhere that can be collected. These will give you insights into the backstory of Rapture and what exactly has happened. There are valuable subplots that you need to pay attention to, such as that of a smuggler in Rapture and his ongoing battle with Ryan, and a woman who feels she has blood on her hands with the transformation of the little sisters. It pays greatly to search every room in the game to not only find ammo, money, health and eve (which is basically mana for your powers) but to find tapes that will fill in the story. It is clever how you are never told absolutely everything given that you are an outsider looking into this world that has gone wrong. The way levels are decorated with trashed rooms and water leakages tells its own story.    The core game play is a mixture of exploration and First Person Shooter combat. You gradually find a stand action game arsenal of a wrench, a pistol, machine gun, shotgun, crossbow and a grenade launcher. These are effective, but not overly powerful given that they have been under the Ocean for twenty years. This arsenal takes a back step towards the Plasmids you purchase as you find Atom. It functions as a currency in that you find a special machine and are then able to choose new Plasmids and slots for them.     These powers include: Fire, Ice, electricity, telekinetic to pick up and hurl objects (like Half-Life 2's gravity gun), a hive of bees and several others. There are also tonics that can act passively (they are on all the time) such as having your body give off an electric shock every time someone acts you with a melee weapon or a Wrench Jockey that increases the damage of your melee attacks. There are limited slots for your powers but you can buy additional ones or swap powers around at gene machines. The interface is perfectly customised for the PC allowing you to switch between Plasmids and weapons on the fly.    You obtain Atom points by either rescuing or killing a Little Sister. You will have to take care of their bodyguards first before you can reach them though. These are monsters in a giant diving suit who are tasked with protecting the sisters and will attack you if you get to close. While Bioshock is a linear game at it's heart, the powers you have demonstrate the versatility of the game world. For example, you may choose to attack a security gun turret with you grenade launcher, yet this would take up vital ammo and health. Instead you could use your electricity bolt to stun the turret and then hack it to fight against enemies for you. Or you can take a pot shot with your fire and then slowly wait for it to burn away at the gun. Why not freeze the turret and then run past it, avoiding it all together? You could pick up a flammable canister using telekinetic and hurl it at it too. You are approach with enemies is like this too. You could freeze an enemy and smash him into pieces but then you can't search him for goodies, like health packs and ammo. You could zap him while he's standing in water, increasing the electrical damage.    The trick with these powers is that later in the game certain Splicer enemies become more resistant to certain powers. A Houdini Splicer who shoots fire at you is obviously going to be resistant against fire and ice. They will be able to disappear before you can hit them anyway. Thus perhaps it is easier to shock them and bash them with a wrench or a blast from a shotgun. It really comes to life at times in the game when you find yourself taking down multitudes of enemies at once, freezing them, then switching the pistol for a swift bullet to the head, listening to them smash into a thousand pieces and then repeating the execution on the next target.     There are many different options with the combat but it is your interaction with the rest of the game world that makes the game so much fun as well. Look at hacking a safe: You can collect various items from the world which can then be put into a “U-Invent Machine”. You may then choose to create an auto-hack and open the safe right away. You may wish to buy out the safe to have it opened. Or you might try playing a mini-game and manually hacking the safe yourself, risking if the alarm goes off the arrival of security bots. It is through this ability to collect so many little things in world of Rapture makes it both fun to explore and to interact with.    The game has been rather unfairly criticised for the inclusion of  “Vita Chambers”. When you are “killed” in Rapture you are automatically brought back to a chamber with you current ammo and eve levels. Essentially there is no penalty for death. This does make the game fairly easy but I do not have a problem with this at all. There is still challenge within the game in that you have to still find a way to dispose of your enemies.    It is also not all that different from players who would frequently quick save before a battle. And it manages to keep the game flowing at a rapid pace too. How annoying it has been to have to repeat one section of a game for hours on end because you don't have enough health or ammo. At last a developer that does not wish to hinder the player's progress.    Some have also said that it reduces the tension of the game. I don't think Bioshock is a particularly scary game in the first place but Rapture with its hollow corridors and brilliant sound design (you can hear every footstep, every word of a Splicer) retains its atmosphere and incredible tension. The game is perhaps at its scariest when it shows you nothing, allowing your imagination to decipher what may or may not be beyond the next door. It is the Unreal 3 Engine that works so well in presenting a world that is as fractured as the people with in it, and makes the game so rich and compelling to play through.    The only true misstep of the game is perhaps the finale which is deduced to a final boss battle that is not particularly hard and less unique than the rest of the game. It is followed by two endings, depending on your treatment of the Little Sister. The bad ending is strange and fairly disappointing, but thankfully the good ending remains sweet and very poignant, which is a rarity in games today.    Bioshock is a game that immerses you so well into its universe that you may not realise till after you have played it how very good it is. Along with Crysis, it is another FPS that is allowing players to have greater control and participation in the action on screen. All of its elements come together in a unique way to prove that this is a very special game indeed.  \",\n",

       "  'description': 'Game Review: Counter Strike: Source Let\\'s start with the history of the Counter Strike franchise. Counter Strike started out as a Half Life 1 modification. The modification pitted terrorists against counter-terrorists and was a smash hit in the Half Life community. It was soon picked up by Valve, the makers of Half Life, and packaged as an entirely different game for those who didn\\'t own Half Life. A few versions of the game later and Counter Strike is now on the Source engine, Valve\\'s pride and joy. The game differs from lots of FPSs in the sense that even a skilled player will have to be cautious and methodical about what he does. There is no running into a room and instantly killing everyone in it without thinking (Except for some INCREDIBLY strong players.)Also, the Source engine makes movement harder and inertia much more prevalent. This makes for a slow, more tactical game that relies heavily on pinpoint aim. The game is played in rounds. Every round both teams start at a designated point with only the weapons and equipment they had last round (In the case of the first round, everyone starts with a handgun.) Both teams can \"Buy\" new weapons at the start of the round. The weapon selection is large and varied. In addition all the weapons are based on real life guns, only with a few minor differences. Pretty much all maps either involve the terrorist team trying to bomb something and the counter-terrorist team trying to stop them, or the terrorist team holding hostages and the counter-terrorists trying to rescue them. While there may be only two gameplay variations, it doesn\\'t get dull. Also one team can win by killing everyone on the enemy team, except in the case where the terrorists have already planted the bomb, in which case the only way for counter-terrorists to win is by defusing it. The graphics in the game are what you would expect from the Source engine, great. For it\\'s time at least. Obviously it pales in comparison to some of the things being released nowadays or even the newer Source based games. Character models look good and animation is pretty smooth. And the weapon models are fantastic. Ragdolls, the flexible dynamic bodies of dead characters, can sometimes bend in...strange ways however. The sound is good, especially footsteps. Listening for footsteps can be very important, many times meaning the difference from bumping into the enemy in a doorway and being shot to death, or being able to hide in that room and ambushing him. This is certainly a game you will want to play with good headphones on. In addition the game has great support for microphones. You can easily plug one in and start chatting and planning with you teammates. However like any online multi-player there is the mandatory \"Griefer\" who simply wants to play loud music into the mic or even worse, start shouting, yelling, and swearing at everyone. Luckily there is the \"Mute Player\" option in the menu that is easy to access, and a breeze to use. The community in Counter Strike is far and away, the largest in any FPS game. There is a multitude of clans and groups you can join, and you will never have any problem finding somewhere to play. This largeness however, comes with its cons. There are plenty of mean people ready to spoil your experience, but as long as you ignore these individuals, you will be fine. Overall, Counter Strike is the granddaddy of all Multi-player shooting games. If you like multi-player shooting and haven\\'t played Counter Strike yet, you owe it to yourself to at least give it a try.3.5/5',\n",

       "  'description': 'Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 3 is without a doubt the best game released in the franchises illustrious game history.\\xa0 It’s also arguably the first Dragon Ball z game that is not only fun to play for die-hard fans, but also casual gamers as well.The game is developed by Dimps, this being their third and final Budokai game before being replaced by Spike for the Tenkaichi series.\\xa0 It was published by Atari and released back in November of 2004, the game also being re-released with a limited edition dvd extra and a few extra items, as well as the option of the Japanese voice track. Budokai 3 is essentially an updated version of Budokai 2; featuring new cel-shaded graphics, a new and improved story mode, a larger character roster and a slew of new mechanical features.\\xa0 The story mode for Budokai 3, named the Dragon Universe, follows Goku and his friends once again and runs from the Saiyan saga right through to the end of the Majin Buu saga from the anime series.\\xa0 Sadly if truth be told it more or less plays as a series of fights linked together with some images and voice-overs, however this time battles are linked with an impressive 3D map that allows you to explore earth finding items and other special encounters.\\xa0 You can also search and obtain the Dragon Balls and eventually make a wish, should you be inclined, using a Dragon Radar given to you if you visit one of the many cities in the game.The Dragon Universe also introduces an RPG element to it, by winning fights you earn experience points and once you gain a certain amount you level up, this giving you skill points to distribute to various attributes.\\xa0 These attributes can have a major effect on a character, everything from your attack power to how much Ki energy your character has is reflected in your attributes.\\xa0 This along with the ability to edit your characters skills gives the game a nice amount of customization, and offers the right amount of depth and strategy to keep people interested throughout the story and arena modes.As far as game play is concerned, it’s never been better.\\xa0 While the basics are still intact the game has some great new features, the most important being teleportation counters and beam struggles.\\xa0 The teleportation system is both simple, but precise.\\xa0 It requires good timing in order to be effective but if done properly is well worth it.\\xa0 The ability to smack your opponent to the sky, teleport behind him and smack him back done again has always been a key part of any Dragon Ball Z fight, and being able to do it in the game feels really good. \\xa0\\xa0As for beam struggles, it’s exactly how it sounds, two beams of energy collide and each tries to overpower the other.\\xa0 It’s a pretty simple, but it looks fantastic.\\xa0 If that weren’t enough the game also has a rock/scissor/paper game of chance called the “Dragon Rush” system.\\xa0 It involves each player pressing a face button with the attacker aiming to press a different button from the defender.\\xa0 If the buttons match up at any point of the three stage attack the defender wins and the move cancels out.\\xa0 However if they’re different throughout, the attacker win and in turn launches a power and cinematic finishing attack.Finally, to bring it all together are the graphics.\\xa0 It’s the use of details cel-shaded graphics and fantastic special effects that make Budokai 3 such a visual treat.\\xa0 The game does have the occasional awkward moment, but overall it looks amazing and is a vast improvement over the previous games.\\xa0 The sound is also top notch as usual with the English voice actors all reprising their roles for the game with enough enthusiasm, and sound effects that sound like they have been taken from the anime.While the game may be several years old it’s still worth playing today.\\xa0 It’s without a doubt the most satisfying Dragon Ball Z game released to date and while visually it may seem dated the game play still holds up nicely.\\xa0 That aside, tweaks and additions to the mechanics, as well as the impressive graphics that make Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 3 such a great game.\\xa0 Even if you’re not a fan of the series there is definitely something to enjoy.\\xa0 \\xa0This being the first and possibly only Dragon Ball Z game that anyone can, and will, enjoy.',\n",

       " {'deck': 'Final Fantasy XII Review',\n",
       "  'description': \"In Square-Enix's most ambitious title of their ongoing franchise, Final Fantasy XII satisfies in more ways than one. It pushes the PlayStation2 to its absolute limit producing some of the prettiest graphics seen on the system, and on such a large scale, that it could only leave fans wanting more as the series graciously bows out of this generation. The game pursues a very much inspired story, which sold at face value, is simpler than it may seem. It involves a great group of characters all well-met through the game's intricate plot, which holds a subtle deepness. Some of the more important characters consist of Ashe - a princess who had lost everything, Balthier - a dashing sky pirate, Fran - the master of weapons, Basch - a loyal knight now branded traitor, Penelo - Vaan's Friend, and Vaan - A boy who seeks freedom in the skies. Although the world they live in may be fantasy, these characters reproduce some of the realist personalities and emotions seen in a Final Fantasy game.  Square-Enix has allowed their players to 'grow up' with the series because of the mature rolls and stance the characters manage to take on throughout the game, which does end up making for better storytelling. The tale beings with the fall of Dalmasca, when peaceful negotiations fail and his royal majesty, the king, is murdered, who's death Basch is held responsible for. With Princess Ashe, the heir to the throne believed to have committed suicide, Basch put to death for high treason, and the Dalmascan's loss of their military fortress, the small kingdom of Dalmasca has no choice but to surrender to the Archades Empire. Vayne is sent by the empire to now restore the state of Dalmasca under his rule, who gains the respect of the people of Dalmasca, unbeknownst to them his true motives. Vaan holds the empire and Basch accountable for the death of his older brother and plans to break into their palace and reclaim whatever spoils they've retained from previous conquest. He gets more than he originally bargained for when he runs into the Princess and two more unlikely characters, Balthier – the sky pirate, and his partner Fran. Things quickly get out of hand and Vaan figures he is now in too deep to stop his adventure. As many plot twist quickly unravel, a minor quest for revenge turns into an epic calling for peace and the restoration of prosperity to Dalmasca.  The plot is very gripping from the beginning, with one of the first twist revealed in no more than the first hour of playing time. Players must be aware, however, a lot does tend to go on behind the scenes and some of the finer details may go overlooked and may offset that the characters emotions never seem to run at an extreme high. Vaan and company each have their own motives when deciding to partake in the events that create Final Fantasy XII. Admittedly, as you progress, the game does at certain points seem to lose sight of that. An object only known as nethicite plays an integral role and ultimately becomes the entire motive. The nethicite is said to contain an unbelievable amount of power and those under the influence of the empire are discovered developing their own manufactured version of this crystal. Princess Ashe seeks to destroy it along with the empire so that she may reclaim her kingdom and her throne. The characters do end up using their special bond of friendship to help the princess in need. It doesn't seem so at first, but the characters aren't lacking the depth of previous Final Fantasy characters. They do share their most personal feelings with one another, but never really get to have that special moment where everyone bask in their love for each other. Instead they manageably sprinkle it over the course of the game. As fore mentioned the cast is a group of more matured peoples; predominantly adults. With little time to show or express emotions they take their problems and foes head on; they haven't the time or the place for any canoodling.  You'll find not only the attitude, but a number of other features in game were introduce or had changed, which seem to be Square's modus operandi this time around. A new gambit system was coupled with a modernistic real-time battle system. If anything, this new battle system is even better if not just as good as the turn-based combat system. Each character has a license board from where the player may decide what type of skills and equips they may benefit from. These skills will translate to what gambits you are capable to set. The gambits practically automate the use of your characters, even those under the player's control. It holds the player less responsible for what decisions your fellow party members make in the midst of combat. The licenses required to acquire these gambits are only gained through the defeat of the many monsters and creatures that inhabit the world of Ivalice.  Changing from the well-known turn-based combat system in past Final Fantasy games, the player is now much more involved in the way things play out through battle, through the license board, active or wait and battle speed configurations. The result is a deep rooted combat system. To elaborate on the gambit system, there are others that are not obtained through the license points of a given character. Vendors, as you'll find, will sell them, as there are many specialty shops in the game. These purchasable gambits usually consist of what to target, who to attack first, and consider status ailments, amount of HP, the amount of SP, and more specific conditions of any given ally, foe, or yourself. These make it easy for the player to have party members use healing and beneficial items, or spells, you may be too busy thinking about your next move to execute. Whether you like doing everything yourself or have this conveniently constructed A.I handle some of the work, the different combinations of do-it-yourself and the gambit system you can make are capable of accommodating all players. It is an excellent change of pace for Square-Enix.  Even more impressive than the new combat system is they manage to pack it and other game content all into one beautiful package. The game is truly a sight for sore eyes. For those of you who have been jumping into the next-generation, you might want to fall back. After seeing the visual capabilities of Final Fantasy XII, owning this game is bragging rights. The edges are ideally smooth, the non-playable characters look good enough to be main ones, and the environments and settings are nothing short of beautiful. You really feel like you're worth something when you actually walk by any given NPC who isn't already engaged in conversation and they give you a glance (some may even stare). The world feels so much more vibrant when you see other non-playable characters enjoying a laugh, possibly arguing or as one speaks and two more appear to be listening attentively. The world these people inhabit is also one of change, in terms of weather. The plains periodically rain, the desert an occasional sandstorm, the mountains a snowstorm. It is during these moments in time the visual quality of the game really shines through. The snowstorm isn't just white polygons constantly falling from the sky it's actually a white haze featuring strong wins blowing snow all over. Rain is sometimes more light than heavy. Sandstorms provide a somewhat grainy effect. Your characters appeal more real as their clothing and hair shift with the wind. As the weather effects bring the world to life, they also spawn certain creatures. This tends to be a condition of hunts.  There isn't a role-playing game without side quest. Leveling could get the better of some, or maybe a task incapable of said player's doing right away (making it daunting), there's nothing like tackling a side quest while you're at it. Along with your typical side quest consisting of random acts of kindness, etc., there is a new hunting system. The bounty hunter of monsters galore, you're able to visit locations where petitioners may have posted a bounty on a problematic monster, referred to as a mark or an elite mark. Sometimes these marks may only appear under certain conditions, such as an all female party, or the current state of weather, but most of the time easy to access. Taking on these bounties can really lengthen your total amount of game hours, increase replay ability and add in a positive way to the experience. You will be rewarded generously for your trouble by those who request your help.  But enough about the game play, and graphics, or what have you, most people just want to know what the game sounds, correct? The Final Fantasy XII soundtrack is what players have come to expect from Final Fantasy. It can be said that not every track is as memorable as some of the battle music in the past, but it all fits well into its place. Another question some may ask themselves is if they'll be able to play through the game again, once finished. This is a role-playing game, and role-playing games aren't tremendously known for their replay value as much their very linear stories. That said, aside from side quest and hunting relieving some of that linear experience, referring back to the license board and gambit system it is capable of adding a great deal of replay value, it just depends if the player is willing to go though the story again, which they should have no problem in doing so. The license board does allow you to build up your characters in which ever way you please. Make Penelo a white mage type; provide her with white 'magik' spells, and mystic armor. Pull Balthier from his trigger and turn him into a knight, providing him with license to use shield and sword. If you haven't caught my drift yet, you can turn your characters into whatever you want them to be in combat.  At the end of it all you will find Ivalice is not a place you want to leave behind. Square-Enix had created a masterpiece in developing their last Final Fantasy on the PlayStation2, and what a way to go out. This game will more than likely be collecting dust with your other classics and PS2 years from now (it'll probably be the only reason you still have one). Final Fantasy XII provides a truly unforgettable experience at no expense. You'd be only fooling yourself if you don't believe you need to go out and purchase this game.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"What you see before your eyes is a review for one of the most popular games ever created, which inspired a generation. Pokemon Red and Blue were games available in Japan in 1996, and then transferred over seas to the U.S. in 1998. It doesn't matter if you love 'em or hate them, no one can deny the following Pokemon led in the 90's. Spawning a successful cartoon after the games success, and popularization of a trading card series in the global market, Pokemon seemed to be unstoppable. It all started with two simple traditional Japanese RPG's birthed from mother Nintendo.   The game's setting is a fictional world populated by Pokemon, which symbolize various animals, fantasy creatures, and imaginative original designs. Pokemon are the fascination of the game's world, studied by science, used as pets, and Pokemon trainers capture these Pokemon to engage them in fights with other trainers in dog-fighting style competitions. All these Pokemon are capable of powerful abilities in relation to what elemental class they are. Pokemon are separated into fire, water, grass, flying, ghost, electric, ect. All these classes have differing strengths and weaknesses, all centering a rock/paper/scissors formula. For example, fire beats grass, electric beats flying, rock beats electric, water beats rock, and so on. Battle normally involves you choosing the opposite element of which ever Pokemon you're facing, if you battling a fire Pokemon, you going to be breaking out your water fighter.   You are a lone adventurer on a quest to become the greatest Pokemon Trainer in the Pokemon League. The world won't simply hand you the championship belt, you must prove yourself by traveling to the world's eight unique Pokemon gyms, and defeating their gym masters. The game itself is focused on traveling gym to gym, but also juggling various quests, battling random trainers, and coming toe to toe with the nefarious Team Rocket, who play as the villians of this story.   The quest itself is not a challenging one, once you master the formula. However this does not mean this is a short winded adventure; the game should take a good 20-30 hours to beat depending on how you play. Completionists will be in awe over the 150 Pokemon you can capture, train, and evolve, racking the play time up dozens of hours.   Past its cute kid-friendly shell, Pokemon is a masterful RPG interlacing simplistic Japanese designs, and implementing an addictive formula. As a representative of the RPG genre it's easy enough for newcomers and enjoyable for the hard-core audience. Pokemon is a legendary franchise from Nintendo and is an all time classic adventure. Giving this game a perfect 10 was no easy decision, but one I feel comfortable with. Very few games every created deserve this medal, but Pokemon is the unicorn of handheld gaming, no one should pass up.\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Review',\n",
       "  'description': 'Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is the second title in the series to touch base with the PlayStation 2. It\\'s no doubt, following the incredible success of Grand Theft Auto III; Vice City had some big shoes to fill. If taking hard to the streets in a no holds barred, balls to the wall, very unorthodox type of way is your guilty pleasure, Grand Theft Auto still offers just about...all of that. When jumping into Vice City, you notice right away the new style, the new sound, and new everything about the game. They also don\\'t skimp out on new characters and plot to match. Rockstar Games take to the 1980s in the story of our ambitious protagonist, Tommy Vercetti. The deal with this guy is he\\'s fresh out of prison, having served fifteen years behind bars, for pulling off a hit for his Mafia higher-ups; who he thinks set him up. Betrayal seems to be the M.O of these Mafioso characters as the game starts with a Sonny Forrelli plotting how to cash in on Vercetti\\'s already tapped out tush, sending him to Florida for a few months, and then paying least suspecting Tommy a visit. Little do they know Vercetti catches onto their little scheme and conjures up his own operation. Vice City screams opportunity to just about every drug lord, pimp, gang, cartel, and the criminally insane--you\\'re here to take it over.  Aside from the simplistic plot, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City allows players to go on an adventure of sorts; to roam freely. Reeking violence and mayhem on innocents is always available to the player, but so are cab driving, ambulance riding, pizza delivering and a number of other side objectives that contribute greatly to the experience that is GTA. A very non-linear experience at that. As aforementioned, the game takes place in the time of the 1980s, and in a very Miami like, Florida city, and with improved graphics the game gets a complete facelift from Grand Theft Auto III. To go along with what the 80s were (or might have been) the vehicles, as well as clothing and buildings, are given a very retro look. The radio plays only the most popular 80s hits, spanning the very basic and most prominent genres. It\\'s a very good looking game, and on its scale, somewhat shows what the PlayStation2 is capable of. At times a building may not completely render, or a small section of the road disappears, but nevertheless achieves the technical prowess gamers and fans of the game have come to expect from Grand Theft Auto; easily not the best looking game, but far from the worst. Nothing worth going into when speaking of how visually stunning Vice City is, when really it seems to earn most of its points in style, rather technical proficiency.  If graphics aren\\'t what matter to you, where GTA really shines is in its gameplay. On its own merits, Vice City, much like III, is one of the most accessible games to play to date. There\\'s no steep learning curve, and the amount of freedom in the game doesn\\'t constrict players to do anything a right or wrong way, it\\'s more of a matter of just getting it done. One may say this contributes to the major mainstream success of the game. With easy controlling, each button executing a simple action, the d-pad and analog controlling direction, the controls feel natural almost 10 minutes into the game. Vice City is very straightforward and very pick up and play.  The way the gameplay is set up is, once your dumped into Vice City, on your city map are marked objective locations that trigger different missions. In the very beginning of the game, your lawyer, Rosenberg works with you through his office, which would be marked with a \"L\" icon. The entrances of these places are usually marked with a pink marker. Entering these places is what will ultimately start every mission in the game. Side missions, such as \"Vigilante\" would be started by entering a specific vehicle (a cop car in this case) and pressing down on the right analog. Periodically missions will be assigned through a pay phone, which are started by simply walking up to these ringing pay phones, marked with pink; It all feels very natural in the city setting that Vice City takes in. Driving, unless you prefer long walks across the beach, is usually the way you will get from one place to another. Find yourself a sea plane or helicopter and you may take to the skies, some missions require their use. Boats are also a form of transportation, and for the first time in the series, motorcycles. You\\'ll find the vehicles are fairly easy to control, some go fast-some go slow is the only variation on the street, but boats have increased handling, and helicopters not so much.  Moving from mission to mission (by way of land, sea, or air) is only a small part of playing Vice City. Actually completing these missions is where all the action takes place. The story takes you through gang wars, money laundering, workforce rioting, and high speed boat chases. It\\'s very enjoyable and almost humorous as to how Rockstar Games ties all these different elements together through very twisted, mischievous, characters and plot. Upon having played Vice City, or even previous Grand Theft Auto titles it\\'s hard to imagine just how any other developers would create a game, possessing so many elements, and not go the same route as Rockstar.  Gamers may find themselves playing Vice City hours on end before completing the main story, and likely, hours after. The Grand Theft Auto series has always boasted true replay ability. The world is very large, compared to other games of its type, the possibilities of what you can experience are nearly endless, and what video gaming is really all about. You\\'re paying retail price for this product one day, and may find yourself still playing it, or picking it up/keeping it in your collection for years to come. On the surface Grand Theft Auto is no more than a mindless, shoot everything in sight, crash as many cars as possible, anti-law enforcement, cash rules everything around me, sort of game, but it\\'s just that--a game, and in every facet of the word. Rockstar Games have discovered their formula to success.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Gameplay Gta 4 gameplay has been vastly improved from it's predecessors from its new cover system to its stream lined mission selection via the very clever mobile phone which keeps the player in control of whatever they want to do and when they want to do it. Gta 4 is comprised of many paths of which there are many benefactors, you as the player decide who deserves your help and who doesn’t. Commonly you will have at least 3 missions to go to at your own will, whilst trying to maintain friendships with friends, family and even your girlfriend via a slue of mini games. Most of the time you will be fighting nail and teeth to get the job done with your finest weaponry but the greatness of Gta 4 is the scenarios it puts you in to do this from gun battles in a museum to master bank robbery. Overall the games great characters and new and exciting missions keep you hooked like a great action movie that never ends.  Graphics   Obviously not at the top of its class but when you take into account the scale of the lush world that is Liberty City it's graphically outstanding, a few hiccups here and there technically but nothing to stop the impressive visual force that is Gta 4. The explosions of which are less frequent this time round deserve a worthy mention.  Sound   As ever a great soundtrack accompanies Gta 4, arguably not as great as some previous renditions but still memorable and vast as you could hope for. The games sound effects are as good and true and the hustle and bustle of the city certainly portrays its self well. One of the great aspects of Gta 4 is the vocals which couldn’t be more perfect and I challenge anyone not to fall in love with the main character Niko Bellic, who I’m sure will become a gaming ledged for ever. In this respect Gta 4 achieves what so many games fail to do which is believable characters that players care for which is important in this game as revenge is a common dish in .  Value   Very lengthy game that provides a lot of satisfaction in one play through which should take you around 30 hours depending on how mission focused you are, though you will definitely want to play the game at least one more time for the alternate results of the choices you can make in the game.  Then there is the online which will hold your attention to a lesser extent but is still quite fun with a vast amount of modes, not enough to distract you from your favourite online shooter but a fun add on none the less.  Conclusion  Gta 4 is a new standard in modern gaming and an innovation in video game story telling. Gta 4 is game that truly has that special something with memorable characters and stream lined interesting and unique gameplay that should be a winner with fans and people new to the Gta series. \",\n",

       "  'description': \"It’s once in a blue moon when movie to game’s actually end up being worth a play through. There have been a diverse amount of these attempts and only a select few have been worth a play through. But can EA pull it together and team up with Warner Brothers to put this game on the map? Well read on to find out what exactly make’s this game tick.  This seller hit the shelves on 29th June 2007. A mere week before its counterpart movie hit the box-office. It was one of the most anticipated movies of the year, so surely this would convince people to go out and buy the game to feel the magic early; surely if the movie’s good the game to be, right? Unfortunately this isn’t the case with all games, and this game isn’t an exception.  The past Harry Potter games have been mediocre at best. But this was EA’s time to make a fresh start and really impress us as they took there series into the next generation; although it was a some what wasted opportunity. The game has its strong points, but in this case it doesn’t balance out the bad points….  This game take’s the young hero Harry Potter into a new adventure that’s darker and dreary than ever. Now that the dark lord Voldermort is on the rise Harry is in more danger than ever, so much in fact Dumbledore won’t always be there to look over him. With Dumbledore stepping down as headmaster of ‘Hogwarts: School of Witchcraft and Wizardry’ and the Ministry not believing Harry about Lord Voldermort’s return, even Harry’s peers are looking at his differently. This year Harry’s friends mean everything to him. You play as Harry as he watches the school go downhill rapidly. Just to make it more inconvenient the Ministry forbid all students to practice magic. As they are convinced they will not need it as Lord Voldermort is not on the rise. So Harry, Ron & Hermione take it upon themselves to make a secret underground organization to teach students how to protect themselves from all things in the outside world that may endanger them. This organization is suitably called ‘Dumbledore’s Army’. So it is your goal to recruit members into your club; this will take you around the new world of Hogwarts trying to persuade your friends into attending your meetings. Persuading them can include doing tasks for them, doing there homework, or simply helping them get there safely.  After you have been your friends skivvy, and doing all there choirs you are ready for your meetings. This is require you teaching your new students new spells which will also then be accessible to you from then on. So there’s a silver lining to you doing everyone’s homework, kind of…  But just as you feel comfortable with your meetings with the DA, and think you are sticking it to the man (new headmaster Professor Umbridge). You get buster in your hiding place by Draco Malfoy who is now recruited by Umbridge. Does a month’s detention sound fun? No? Not even virtually? No? Fine then!  But seeing Umbridge’s outraged face in high definition is worth all the money I paid for this game. She is one of the nastiest pieces of work in a long time. This brings me onto the graphical aspects of the game. The school looks like it has been carved from a fine stone. The details around the castle will easily make you impressed. Although it would seem the developers spent a little too long working on this because the characters in the game don’t look all that great. Maybe it’s harder making a real life person into a character? Maybe its just Daniel Radcliff’s face? I’m not to sure. But after looking at the graphical potential in this game it’s a bit of a disappointment when you see your favorite characters for the first time.  Unfortunately this story isn’t all that great in the length department. It can be done in about 4-5 hours if one sitting if you know what to do. But if you aiming to do all the side objectives such as chess champion, snap champion etc; this would add a considerably large about of time onto this game, but still it doesn’t make the $60 you paid for this game worth it. But there are still all the discoveries around Hogwarts to discover. These help you unlock achievements (around 200gs worth). As you discover something new about Hogwarts (fix statues, hang portraits, mop up mess on the floor, rake leaves etc) you get some discovery points (around 5-10 for each thing you discover) at first you just need about 200 points to reach the next level, which wouldn’t take that much time. The highest level is level thirteen, which needs 15,000 points, so as you could imagine this would take a lot of things to be discovered. So for that much discoveries you would need a large area to search right? Well you got it, in this addition Hogwarts is a lot bigger and more open ended that in the last games. So finding everything in every nook and cranny won’t be an easy task although no loading screens make things a little easier, so best keep a sharp eye on everything all the time. Or you may just miss something important.  But exploring cant all be bad, as you unveil and venture into a new environment the music can change and shape itself into something more suitable to your surroundings; Which is great as the music in this game is definitely one of its strong points. Say if you went strolling into the forbidden forest or the dungeons the music will become slow and dense with a very atmospheric sensation. Then as you enter the Great Hall where all your classmate’s are usually eating the music changes to something cheers are you hear people chatting and practicing magic at there table’s, a very nice and warm feeling. This is the first game that used the original Harry Potter theme song (also recognized as Hedwig’s Snowy theme). As odd as it may sound in the past the Harry potter franchise didn’t even have legal rights to the movie’s theme sound. But now its here, and you can hear it as you escalate the castles revolving staircase. A great new ambitious addition to this game is the new manual spell casting system. This allows you to have full control of Harry’s right arm at the push of a button (Y). To do the spells you with to do you have to move Harry’s arm in a certain fashion, each spell requires s different movement of the arm. Some require a rotational action, while some just need an up/down movement. But memorizing these sequences is the tricky part. There are a total of 12 spells you need to learn and act out throughout the game. There are 6 defensive spells and 6 offensive spells. These are mainly used in dueling which trigger at certain parts of the game. Also some spells can be used while roaming around the castle, spells such as Reparo (which repairs things) and Incendio which sets things alight.  The only major disappointment about this game is the abysmal thing they call cut scene's. It is a huge let down when a game with such a huge potential suffers greatly by little things like this. The cut scene's in this game are nothing short of 5-10 second clips of blotchy inaccurate movie to video game character models. Its as though the game tries to keep you as far away from the characters emotionally. It doesn't give you time to feel what Harry feels as he's exploring Hogwarts for getting abuse shouted at him by the opposing house mates.  If you are looking to finish this game to completion with all achievements unlocked you will be forced the go through the game on the hardest difficulty, which isn’t hard at all. Its pretty much the same as all you need to do is do tasks, only thing that may cause concern are the duals but with a bit of determination you will get through it. Also another thing you will be forced to do is beat all the mini objectives (chess, bowls, snap challenge’s etc). So you will need a slight knowledge of the games and a quick hand. Good luck! (4/10 – Pretty Easy to get all achievements)  Overall this is a very enjoyable game, but isn’t much if you wanting a game that will last you for a while. This game could easily be completed and finished with all achievements in a single day. But it’s very enjoyable while it lasts. But $60 for a game that will last a day isn’t a very good deal. So I would advise renting this game, but it worth a play through if you enjoy the Harry Potter franchise and/or the game series.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Black is one of those I had a hard time deciding what score I'd give it. Sure, the game is really good, it does what it sets out to do, really, really well. Shooting the 15 or so real world weapons is a blast. AK-47s, UZIs and even RPGs will help you destroy an load of faceless troops. The combat is very smooth, and features some incredible animations, reloads and even some wicked muzzle flashes, basically, all the weapons feel and play like monsters However, this accompanied by a staunted Single Player experience (Which only lasts 5 hours) and a slew of other shortcomings leave what could have been a homerun, a pile of miss pitchs. There is also no real story, so just forget about that.The First great thing you will notice will of course be the guns and all of the crap you can blow up with them. This is actually not as much as you'd want. Sure theres a plenty of explosive barrels and some glass here and there, but in terms of environemnts, there is really a lack of true level destrucion. You basically wonder around waiting for that next explosive device to show up, and shoot that, and the same scripted animation will play as usual. Its a very powerful game, don't get me wrong, but there's not very much of it to boot, and about 80% of the thrills it offers up are purely scripted moments.Visually the game is gourgeous for a Last Generation title. The visuals really pop and the weapon models look incredible. By todays standards you'd still be impressed. I loved the game's use of a different mood for each level but this graphical touch isn't saying much when theres only 7 levels. The Sound is badass as well, and it's almost as booming as a Call of Duty game, if not more. This game still could have used a few more months in the oven before its launch however in terms of these next flaws.Bugs, Terrible AI and short length single player are the contributing factors to this games sufferege. Its a solid shooter with great\\xa0explosions and some awesome guns to toss in, but the lackluster AI and god aweful level design leaves me somewhat saddened. The game is only 15 bucks, but as the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 continue to pump out mega house shooters like KILLZONE 2 and Call of Duty 4, theres really no looking back nowdays. Hopefully criterion will make a Black Paradise if you will and turn the series on its head with some changes and maybe some co-op love, but as it stands, BLACK is a solid, 3 out of 5. \",\n",

The characters are all believeable and you start to really immerse yourself in the game world. This is furthered by testing your morality I also had to seriously consider my choice of whether to harvest or save the little sisters (I chose to save). The weapons and plasmids were also pretty awesome i especially liked that upgrading a weapon changed the way it looked.

       " {'deck': 'STALKER: SHADOW OF CHERNOBYL',\n",
       "  'description': \" STALKER: SHADOW OF CHERNOBYL      The year is 2012, six years after a second meltdown occurred within a Chernobyl nuclear reactor. The land of has been deformed and left with many abnormalities, deformed wildlife and men known as STALKERS who scavenge the area of Chernobyl, looking for valuable artifacts. Awaking from a road accident, you are left with amnesia, a tattoo on your arm that says STALKER and a PDA with an instruction to kill a man named Strelok. With little choice you must complete jobs for the men who saved your life, find out who Strelok is and discover your true identity.      S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Shadow of Chernobyl was in development by GSC Game World since 2001 and the game was met with many delays and setbacks over the course of its production. The final result is certainly ambitious, with a mix of First Person Shooting and horror elements. Yet it is quite clear from the opening stages of the game that this was an overly ambitious project, lacking the definitive polish of so many other shooters.      The world of Chernobyl is a rich setting and one that we have not seen too often in other shooters before. Certainly from a Ukrainian developer there is a quite a personal story to be told here and you can really appreciate the efforts that GSC have gone into trying to model the environments on its real life counterpart. They have stated in their development diaries that their “newly-created X-ray engine allowed near-photo realism.” Yet sadly the game suffers from some poor visuals, with a horribly drab and grey colour palette and some very flat textures, lacking in normal mapping. Character models too, while often well detailed, seem slightly blocky and stiff, particularly in the animation and physics. The latter is particularly noticeable as bodies lay on the ground with limbs in various comical yoga positions.      Yet given the quality of the smaller indoor areas, with strong lighting and shadow effects, one could attribute the poor outdoor visuals to the size of the game world. While the developers originally wanted a world without load screens the higher graphical quality of the planes of Chernobyl had to be cut down in size. Thus there are 18 different zones to travel through around the Zone, broken up between load screens. You will visit many of these as you take on various tasks from your saviors at the beginning of the game and also when you meet others along the way who will offer optional missions too. While some have tagged STALKER as an RPG, these do not feel as though they contain any moral choices but whether you would just want a job or not. If you do you will have to endure much backtracking and travel.      Some of these missions range from killing a rookie S.T.A.L.K.E.R, to collecting data files, or defending a base from opposing factions. In what is supposed to be such an advanced open world these missions feel quite simple, with basic fetch tasks. The finale in particular feels overly drawn out and feels as though it belongs in another game, away from the scavenging missions of the beginning of the game.      It can also be confusing as to what the missions have to do with the main plot, which leads to STALKER's more significant issues. There is a such a fascinating world in Chernobyl and yet the plot of the game is surprisingly poor. Much of the story is conveyed through text and allows many details to feel unengaging and uninteresting. It is a strange design decision given that some characters have verbal dialogue but many others do not and also because of the amount of the time the game was in production. Surely they could recorded some more lines of dialogue. For a story so personal to the developers it feels as though they have missed a opportunity to tell something moving and poignant. We never see the real victims of Chernobyl, the humans that survived and had to live on, only monsters and killers, searching for riches. The factions you encounter along the way also feel undetailed and lacking in any memorable characters. You may never remember what their motives or ideologies are, as you may have in other games like Deus Ex.      Where STALKER does excel however is in its chilling atmosphere and fierce gunplay. This is a relentless and dangerous world, and the gushing winds that soar around you and the barks of the mutated wildlife you encounter, accentuate this. The underground areas are even more frightening with some terrific ambient noises. You will find yourself turning around, checking to make sure that there is nothing behind you. This is easily one of the scariest games on the PC. Perhaps the developers could have pushed this even further by not showing you anything at all, leaving the monsters to your imagination. More scripted moments would have added some spontaneity  rather than just relying on the erratic nature of the AI patterns.      There are a variety of different foes you will encounter such as mutated boars, savaged dogs and various other bloodsuckers. These are more gross than scary, perhaps resembling something from a low budget Peter Jackson horror movie. There are human opponents too as you would expect and these come in the form of other S.T.A.L.K.E.R's and heavily armored soldiers. The AI is very uneven and quite bizarre at times. Soldiers will quite often take cover in gunfights and try to flank you by circling around your position. At other times though they will seem oblivious to the fact that you are shooting them in the back or that you have gunned down their friends. On one humorous occasion there were half a dozen soldiers trying to all get through the one door at the same time: they failed. When you see NPC's spawning right in front of your eyes you just know that the game sadly does not have the polish and slickness of other FPS like FEAR and Half-Life 2.    Luckily the gunplay is kept quite tense due to the assortment of weapons you will have at your disposal. By completing missions you will receive money that will allow you to buy or trade weapons off other STALKER's. Eventually you will have access to many highly powered assault rifles throughout the game and All of the guns sound terrific, loud and efficient. The way in which you can hear bullets ricochet off cover, and the very unpredictable AI, keeps the gunplay fun and exciting. The only downside is that the hit detection on some weapons feels quite off at times. You will often empty a clip into an enemy and it will look as though they have been left unscathed. It is meant to depend on the range of the weapon and its condition too (they will weaken and jam overtime) but it sometimes seems as though there either aren't enough hit animations for enemies when you strike them or the weapons are just a bit underpowered.      Much of the tension is also derived from how vulnerable you are in the game. Only on the second difficulty, of which there are four, I found this to be a very, very tough game. It only takes a few shots for you to meet your end. You have a health bar that will regenerate slowly over time but this isn't Call of Duty 4. If your health gets too low you could die of blood loss, with little indicators appearing on screen to warn you of your fate. You have an RPG-like inventory so that you can carry an assortment of goods like artifacts, guns and bandages to help you.      Sometimes though it would seem as if the game is stuck between realism and its game mechanics. While you can die of blood loss you can also carry health packs that will instantly revitalise your health, or you can eat tins of pudding to do the same. One of the more annoying things to accommodate for is radiation. If you step into a radiated area, of which there are many, you will have to use an antidote and race away from the area. You also have a stamina meter and if you carry too much junk in your inventory this will run out very quickly. This can be extremely annoying when you are running away from gunfire only to see the words appear on the screen “you're too exhausted to walk” and be stopped dead in your tracks.      It can also be a chore to have to balance out your inventory and stamina realistic or not. The stamina is perhaps at its worst when you must travel great distances of Chernobyl on foot. You have a limited ability to sprint and there is no fast travel in this game as say in Oblivion. The developers were originally hoping to implement vehicles into the game and this would have greatly changed the nature of the gameplay and obviously cut down on some very boring and tedious travel time. For those eager enough there are many modifications out there can add vehicles and other goodies to the game.      There are some interesting twists to the FPS genre in STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl, but perhaps not all of these are particularly welcome. The game is too difficult to be enjoyed as a pure shooter and the story is too convoluted to become memorable. The atmosphere and setting however are still worthy of mention and the soon to be released prequel should address many of the issues here. This is an ambitious title but it's initial concept is more successful than the long awaited outcome.\",\n",

       "  'description': \" Super Smash Bros. Brawl is a game that's virtually impossible to dislike for anyone who's been around the block in the gaming world, or anyone who's just a sucker for nostalgia. While Brawl is an obligatory player's choice on the Nintendo side, gamers from all demographics will indubitably find charm in this Brawler.  Veterans of the Smash Bros. series will find no surprises on the game play side of Brawl. Like its predecessors, Brawl sticks to chaotic four player battle contentions, and simplistic two button fighting mechanics. Combining these two attributes creates a very accessible party game anyone can enjoy. While it may seem to be a minor issue, and a common dispute people have with the Smash Bros. series, it must be restated that after spending just a few hours with Brawl, you'll find tiers of characters. Some characters like Meta Knight are obviously over powered, and since this isn't a serious fighting game that's an aimless statement. However, it's common knowledge that Smash Bros. is a common figure in competitive gaming.  Anyone who picks up a Gamecube controller (controller of choice) for the first time, will find no difficulty in learning the basic gameplay formula of the two button combat, and trying your best not to fall of the edge. More time will be spent training yourself to cope with the chaotic action, and depict where your character is on screen, while managing to fight off three other guys, also successfully dodging at the same time.   Long term fans of the series will be in awe over this iteration's character roster. Your typical guys from the Nintendoverse are here, Mario, Pikachu, Link, Samus, Fox, and so on. But characters like Diddy Kong, and Wario finally make it to the fight. While Nintendo faboyism will smile at any roster with these classical gaming icons, 3rd party characters like Sonic and Snake enter the fray, adding to the astonishing thirty-plus roster.   Playable characters almost seem secondary considering all the arenas you'll be unlocking throughout playing. Some arenas are straightforward typical Smash Bros. environments, but some others are totally rad. Stages, such as the Metal Gear Solid arena will take you to Shadow Moses Island, the beginning area of the Playstation classic, or Twin Snakes since we're talking Nintendo here. The PictoChat level is crazy, because while you're fighting, the level is constantly being redrawn. The WarioWare stage is the most chaotic of the bunch, as it occasional breaks into WarioWare-esque mini games, and failing to do so results in some minor harm to your health, adding to the overall chaos, and fun.   With all these playable characters, and stages, comes with a soundtrack that would make Tommy Tallarico cheer as a triumph. Fans are served with audio on a platter, with musical scores both new, and old, covering all the characters in the game.   To the excitement of the entire world, Smash Bros. will finally be playable online to play with strangers, and friends who share a long-ass code. To much surprise the online works fine, but feels empty. The lack of a voice chat option really hinders the experience, and really takes away from the Smash experience, which is a collection of dudes in a room yelling, swearing, and laughing. Even if Brawl had a more constructed online, and voice chat, I don't believe it could duplicate the experience of the local multiplayer. Gather your friends, order some pizza, crank out the unhealthy energy drinks, and Brawl until the sun rises. That's where Super Smash Bros. Brawl shines the brightest.   In addition to regular fighting, and multiplayer madness Brawl also has an adventure mode that is the personification of nostalgia, the Subspace Emissary. In reality, the Emissary is just a side scroller that has a co-op option. Those who aren't familiar with the Nintendo family, or simply don't hold sentimentality towards the 1st party franchisees will find little enjoyment here, but those who love the characters will find plenty of novelty in the Emissary. Some levels feel tacky, and trivial, but seeing Fox and Diddy Kong team up against a giant Pokemon is awesome, not to mention uncovering R.O.B. the robot to be a villain. After twenty years, who knew!? It seems the game play in this mode was an afterthought, and the true purpose was to provide players with awesome cut scenes with unvoiced (thank God) Nintendo icons interact with each other, and fight against a common enemy.   Recommending Brawl comes down to three simple questions. One of course would be, do you like videogames? No, Brawl isn't to that degree, but if you're a fan of Nintendo novelty, and can appreciate Nintendo's rich history, a Brawl purchase is a no-brainer. If you have the ability to gather together a good set of buddies, and you never sold those Gamcube controllers, Brawl is a game that should be in every Wii owner's library.\",\n",

No neck breaking? My 14 year old mind couldn't comprehend the lack of actual gameplay in a videogame. So I was very suspicous about the actual quality that this game would have. Well, let's just say that this game kicks ass.The game takes the style of a Metal Gear Solid in that it feels like an interactive movie. The camera will change angles to create a cinematic type atmosphere, and David Cage, the game's creator, did an amazing job of emersing the player inside a dark and creepy environment.You play as Lucas, a man who awakes from a trance to realize that he had murdered a man in cold blood by performing a ritual killing. As he awakes, he must hide the body and clear the crime scene before cops arrive. Right from the beginning, you always feel a heightened sense of suspense, that you may not have enough time to finish a task, something that kept me on the edge of my seat, a rarity for me in videogames.All is not to love, however. The story gets very, very weird, especially in the second half, to the point where many people may laugh at how bizarre or stupid the twists become. It didn't matter to me, though. I thought Indigo Prophecy was a once in a lifetime game with a great story and solid suspensful gameply mechanics behind it.\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories',\n",
       "  'description': \"Liberty City Stories, for the PlayStation2, is a port from what seems to be a developing PlayStationPortable (PSP) franchise, with games inspired by and based from the Grand Theft Auto console games. In this particular spin-off you return to Liberty City, the well-known metropolitan area made famous in the GTA series' most revolutionist title, Grand Theft Auto III, for the PlayStation2. For those of us players who lack such a long-term memory, in Grand Theft Auto III you most of the time ran around doing errands and pulling off hits for a variety of characters. One of these characters was, I daresay, mama's boy Toni Cipriani. Toni Cipriani makes his appearance in Grand Theft Auto III as a loyal member of the Leone family who suddenly disappears. Through his somewhat cryptic message, left behind, it is apparent he's laying low after putting someone to rest. Liberty City Stories does not hesitate to let the players know he's back, and not only is he back, but you actually are playing his character this time around.  This is great news, or at least players thought it was. The game gives you the impression that you're no longer at the bottom of the barrel trying to rise to the top, you aren't a petty street thug, or thief, but in fact that you're apart of something now, part of the Leone family, almost a made man, no longer running simple errands, because you have bigger fish to fry and much bigger problems to solve! Now as interesting as that sounds, or I made it sound (forgive me), Rockstar Leeds could have not made it anymore uninteresting. As unpredictable as the game seemed before hitting store shelves, all the more predictable it was as you played the game. As foreshadowed you are no longer a grunt, you're almost a made man, you deserve more respect than you get, a capo, your Don's right-hand man. Regardless of all these things, however, the man in charge, Don Salvatore Leone puts you under the watchful eye of small-time Vincenzo Cilli to the player's and Cipriani's dismay. It is for Cilli that you will in fact find yourself running more errands, helping him out, while you make a few extra bucks in return. The rest of the game doesn't fan out from this concept, calling for repetitive game play and lack of depth.  The reason you probably won't find this game at all fun to play is because most of the time you're completing missions you aren't really accomplishing anything. Most of the missions you get nothing out of except the money, which the value changes greatly between that of the real world and Liberty City. You'll find yourself driving from point A to point B, unless things get really exciting and you must continue to point C. How a Grand Theft Auto game usually plays after you've beaten it is how Liberty City Stories feels all the way through. Countless unnecessary shootings, car jackings, and police chases. This is a port from the PSP so don't expect as fancy or big a selection of vehicles as with other Grand Theft Auto titles on the PlayStation 2. Some driving fast and some driving slow, is really what it'll boil down to in the long run when deciding which car to hop in. I mentioned shootings and as far as weapons go you can expect the same range of them. You have your pistol, machine guns, rocket launcher, grenades and pipe bombs as players have gotten familiar with in the other games. They make good for a quick scheme of running from the police as they always have. There is, however, a minor plus that Liberty City Stories poses with weapons. You are now able to sprint with any/all of them, big or small. The excitement wears thin after a prolonged amount of time though. There's still plenty to do outside of missions such as the unique stunts and finding of hidden packages.  If there's anything that makes this game harder to play it is the terrible graphics from PSP blown up to your TV screen. The camera angles also looked to be scrunched no matter how much adjustments you make. It's clear the difference in graphical capability between the PlayStation 2 and PSP, but this game makes it crystal clear. With obvious shapes and horrendous lighting effects no better word could describe this game, but ugly. Also the cheap price tag ($20) proves exactly you're getting what you pay for, which in this case, isn't much. I couldn't go on about the visual limitations as there, negatively speaking, wasn't much to go on about.  In essence the game holds true to other minor details the games are known for like the original radio stations, humorous ads followed by funnier shop names, and open-endedness. Disappointingly none of which added up enough to overcome the game's shortcomings. It's a very basic, watered down, version of Grand Theft Auto that would be more accepted on a handled then any console. Save yourself the twenty bucks, it's better spent elsewhere.\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'Star Wars Battlefront II review by Termite',\n",
       "  'description': \"Game Review: Star Wars Battlefront IIStar Wars Battlefront, the previous game in the series, was released on September 21, 2004 and was met with quite a lot of critical praise. And as with any developer that ends up with cash due to one of their games, Lucas Arts decided to make a sequel. And good for them! Because this game is a very worthy sequel to a great game.The Battlefront games are class-based team multi-player shooters ( You can play in both First Person and Third Person modes ) and have you running around as any of those entertaining Star Wars dudes. You could be on the empire's side and shoot people down as an evil Storm Trooper. Or you could make odd-sounding roars and shoot people with a crossbow as a Wookie. Whatever floats your boat really ( No, there are no boats in this game )Also, like the eerily similar Battlefield series ( Hell, even the names sound alike ) victory usually depends on which team is in control of the most control points. Controlling more than half of them slowly depletes the reinforcement pool of the enemy. Killing enemies also depletes their reinforcement pool, or to be more exact every time an enemy spawns, one point is lost from it. This system works well, although it does prove to be rather troublesome especially on elite difficulty because your computer controlled teammates can be rather brain-dead resulting in their death and many times in your defeat. This is not a problem on multi-player of course.Which brings us to the worst part of the game, the AI. Your enemies are about as smart as...lets say a potato. They often run around in circles or even kill themselves randomly. This is alleviated by the fact that the game revolves around mega-huge battles involving hundreds of troops but it's hard not to notice it. This makes it so you can kill dozens of enemies in elite mode in one life, which you would assume would mean victory. But because elite mode seems to make your computer controlled teammates even stupider than they already were and increases the damage of the enemies, you usually lose miserably.The game has quite a few maps, but quite a few of them are space maps. And to be honest, space battles aren't that fun at all. You know those enormous space battles that you see in the Star Wars movies? Of course you do. These aren't a lot like those unfortunately. To win, your team has to amass enough points. These points are gained by killing enemies ( You can get on their mothership thing and just kill dudes before they get on ships, or just destroy the ships. Both of these give you 1 point ), destroying small capital ships surounding the enemy mothership, or destroying components of the mothership. Every single one of these tasks is tedious and boring. And as I've said before, the AI is pretty brain-dead so it won't be hard to go about your business unscathed. One thing that is good about these battles is that unlike the land-battles, elite mode doesn't mean you are likely to lose even if you kill hundreds of enemies yourself (Why this is I do not know ).Anyway, unlike the space battles the land battles are pretty interesting. There are lots of cool vehicles for you to use and the different classes provide minor, but cool differences. The control point system is solid so no complaints there. Also, if you get enough points you can become a Jedi ( Or Sith ) for a limited amount of time. The limit is very lenient though, as you gain more time by killing enemies ( Which as you might have guessed, is not that hard as a Jedi ). Some maps have you become a non-Jedi character such as Princess Leia, all of whom are quite dull.The weapons feel....bad. Some of them are nice to use such as the rocket launcher, but others are just plain dull such as the laser rifle thing that many classes have. You will want to get in a vehicle as soon as possible, as those are much more fun to use.The vehicles in the game are not overpowered, but they are quite a lot stronger than any regular infantry. In a multi-player match you it would take a very good player or a few coordinated players to take down a vehicle with a decent pilot. Luckily the respawn time for a lot of these vehicles are fairly long which provides some nice balance.But we haven't gotten to the story or the campaign mode yet have we? It follows the exploits of a division of clones who were instrumental in the rise of the Evil Empire. It also shows the evolution of the clones from Attack of the Clones into the Storm Troopers we all know and love. Overall it is fairly interesting, however I feel that as I am not a big Star Wars fan it was sort of a pearls before swine situation where I couldn't fully appreciate it.The campaign mode is solid, with some pretty good missions to keep you interested until the end. It doesn't stand out amongst the vast reserves of FPS games the world has to offer, but its respectable nonetheless.Also there is a mode where you can Conquer the Galaxy ( Always a welcome addition to any game ). It starts you off with some cash ( Or...credits? ) and with one planet and a fleet with which to kick alien butt. Some planets offer bonuses if you capture them as well. The objective is to eliminate the enemy power by conquering all the planets he has. This mode is pretty fun, but the campaign was better in my opinion.Multi-player was good. Notice that I say was, as the community is pretty much non-existent as of now. This dramatically reduces the value of the game, as the multi-player was the main feature when it was released. I will not go further on about multi-player, because chances are you aren't going to be playing it.Anyway, that is about all I can say about this game. It is good and not great. A good rental if you ask me.Overall score: 3.5/5\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (2005) places you deep into the fictional city of Los Santos. You play Carl Johnson, known to most, as just C.J. He’s a guy who’s been away from the hood for five years, living it out in Liberty City. Returning back to the hood where he grew up he finds that things have changed. His homies don’t have the power they once had and he is quickly framed and blackmailed by Officer Tenpenny (voiced by Samuel Jackson). It is up to you to win back the respect for your family and clear your name.    Critics were not shy to praise this long, sprawling and epic game when it was originally released on Playstation 2. This console port has also accumulated many accolades and a warm reception from gamers. I have not played a Grand Theft Auto game since the second installment all those years ago. I approached this game with some expectation for all the hype (and controversy) it had generated. Strangely however, the game for me at least fell well short of what had been said about it.    Your task throughout the entire game is to complete a series of crazy missions ranging from spray painting walls to stealing fighter jets. There are three huge city maps to explore as you progress throughout the game. And when I say huge I mean absolutely enormous. The scale of the game is just so grand. It is tremendously impressive how the developers Rockstar have crafted these maps without a single load screen. You are free to explore these maps at your own will and as it has been documented there is a great variety of activities to do. You can buy new clothes, go to the gym, buy food, go to a casino and many more. Many of these contribute to your statistical points, one of the new additions to the GTA formula. Food for example will increase your fat level and as such lower your stamina.    The disappointment with these activities and statistics is how poorly they are implemented. As a novelty they remain a fairly cool surprise. Yet beyond this they are little more than just a novelty. Sure you have the option but really who is going to waste their time searching an entire map for a Taco restaurant? You never seem to have to worry about your statistics either. They seem to randomly increase and decrease throughout the game without your intervention. Your muscle for example will just decrease even while you’re swimming. The same is for your relationship with your girlfriend, one of the more ridiculous and pointless components of the game. Having not seen the old girl for many, many hours suddenly the progress with whatshername randomly increased – what the? People have spoken about the level of freedom that having clothing stores and food places give the game. Yet is it really a massively opened world? Many of the activities can only be accessed and unlocked after a certain time of playing the game. It really comes off as a bit of a cheat for a so-called freeform game. What is the point of having this huge open world if you’re going to say when the player can actually access it?    If you play the game as a linear sequence of missions to follow the “plot” though it doesn’t fare much better. Many of the missions don’t actually contribute to the story and it comes off disjointed at best. The game Mafia was infinitely superior in its storytelling with a much tighter plot. Everything you did made a powerful contribution to the way of life you had chosen and the story as a whole. Here it seems the developers are trying to be as silly and crazy as possible. I couldn’t help but feel that many of the tasks that I was being asked to do were just pointless. Towards the end of the game for example you’re told to steal a fighter jet and then go out and destroy some boats. This late in the game it just felt preposterous with no real motivation or reasoning at all.    There are many colourful characters to meet in the game but many of them seem to disappear for long periods of time and some really are better than others. The voice acting is quite solid all round though. Tenpenny, Samuel Jackson playing Jules from Pulp Fiction is a pretty cool villain while CJ remains likable, though I really wouldn’t call him a protagonist. He really does come across as a tool in the game with people always telling him what to do. The Truth – an aged hippy voiced by Peter Fonda – isn’t quite as great as you’d think either. While the paranoid CIA guy (James Woods) is just strange…I found it to be a real muddle and it really drops the ball quite a bit late by the second city. I began to lose track of who was who and what was happening. I really didn’t care all that much after a while. Some pretty snappy dialogue throughout aids the characters though. For the most part it is very funny. I think James Woods has one of the better lines when he reassures CJ: “You'll be back before you know it for a blow job and a baloney sandwich”. Though there remains a lot of gangster rapper talk which, as funny as it maybe, could be off putting for some (can you dig it?).    The core game play is made up of driving to a particular target, like sneaking into a mansion for example, collecting an item or killing someone, and then escaping. One of my biggest problems with the game is that there is a complete lack of a save system. You can save it at your safe house, which is fine, but then you have to drive all the way to the mission, activate it and then partake without a safety net. You can’t save it during the mission and there are no checkpoints. If you fail, well too bad, because you’re going to have to load and then drive all the way back again. This has got to be one of the most ludicrous design decisions I have ever seen in a game. The frustration I went through in having to reply levels over ten times was unbelievable. It is also incredibly annoying that once you’ve finished a mission you to have to drive back from the middle of nowhere to your save point. The country missions are the worst offenders of this. It becomes so tiresome and downright boring at times.    At least later in the game there are safe houses that can be purchased at little closer to the missions but it still remains a real drag especially since there isn’t even a restart mission button. It just makes the game feel artificially difficult and padded out. Why Rockstar would want to do this is a real mystery.    Its not like the game is short by any means. There are over a hundred missions as well as multiple side quests, including taxi missions, vigilante jobs and ambulance stages. It is enormous. Without the save system a lot of the fun of the missions is definitely sapped away though. What should be crazy and hilarious just becomes aggravating It’s a real shame. Yet the lack of a save is not the only reason why the game suffers. Having been ported from a console system the usual control problems have been inherited. While the game may work fine with a controller using the keyboard is at times a nightmare. Lets just say I have been put off ever wanting to fly a plane with this game.    The controls are often clumsy and awkward with the vehicles, particularly the aircraft. I actually had to walk away from the game at times. I don’t think I have ever, in ten years or so of gaming, thrown my hands up and said, “I can’t do this”. Not until I met the old San Andreas that is. I am still having nightmares about an optional mission called Supply Lines, where you have to control a remote control plane. At least the motor vehicles are a bit more enjoyable than the aircraft. My favourite is the motorbike. It can really glide along the streets and it makes for a smooth ride. Others however, like low rider cars, are again way too loose in their controls. Turn slightly during a chase and the car swerves way too much forcing you into a spin. It can be very annoying. I don’t think the cars are all that exciting in their design either compared to GTA II. At least some of those were a bit imaginative, distinctive and crazy. Here you have your fare share of hatchbacks, taxis, police cars and many more, nothing particularly special.    You will be doing a lot of shooting throughout the game and the gunplay is certainly better than the driving. It never reaches the heights of Max Payne though since it’s just so simplistic. Enemies, or lemmings as I like to call them, will often run straight towards your line of fire allowing you to take them down. There is no onscreen crosshair. Instead you have to hold down the right mouse button and then aim (preferably to the head). It feels a bit cumbersome at first but you will eventually get used to it and its fairly enjoyable. You are given a fairly conventional set of weapons including shotguns, machine guns, pistols, a chain saw, a knife, baseball bat and many others. They never really have a lot of crunch to them since the sound effects are a bit flat. The mini gun you use on a helicopter at once sounds more like a lawnmower with something stuck in it then a highly charged weapon. The only really tension from these gun fights is derived from the fact that you know if you fail you’ll have to start again, which is a bit of a copout.    I just wish the AI (Artificial Intelligence) wasn’t so…I’m trying to think of a nice way to put this…absolutely dreadful. This game has got to have some of the worst AI I have ever seen. Enemies will frequently run into walls and then run around in circles not realizing their path is blocked. Police officers don’t even seem to mind when you drive through a red light in front of them or walk right past them with a gun in your hands. I know it’s America but gosh you’d think they’d be tougher on these things. Even worse is when you hire a gang to take back the hood. You might as well have left them at home to watch MTV. Your homies will either get lost, fail to keep up with you, get run over, or most hilariously I suppose, just stop at the traffic lights looking bewildered. There was another fairly amusing moment of road rage when I stole a man’s truck. He leapt up off the road and then pulled out a golf club and began swinging at his own van only to continuously fall short of his target. He didn’t seem to mind though. It really is embarrassing at times.    Visually the game is again a really mixed bag. In all fairness it has been ported from a console game. Yet there really should have been much higher textures. Many look really flat and ugly and dull and buildings in particular are of the copy and past job. Despite this there is no doubting the effort of Rockstar to create such a detailed city. Streets are wonderfully compiled with tiny details like streetlights and cars and pedestrians. The lighting from the sun is quite beautiful too and the whole game does carry quite a stylish cartoon-like look about it. It just surprised me though for all the effort placed into these cities the interiors of the buildings are really lacking. You won’t go into them all that much but areas like a mansion for example are minute and never look or feel like what they’re supposed to be. There is also not enough furniture in these either. As silly as it sounds it looks just ridiculous to have the room of a mansion nearly empty with any furnishings. The character models in the cut scenes aren’t all that great either and don’t look well-animated, particularly compared to games like Half-Life 2.    If there were a strange compliment I could give the game it would be that San Andreas is strangely addictive in its awfulness. Despite all its problems I kept coming back to the game to try and finish it. (I eventually had to call it quits one mission from the end but that’s a different story). Perhaps it is the likeability of the characters or the potential that the game and series has for true greatness. With a proper save system, tighter story and improved AI there is much that Grand Theft Auto IV could amount to. Word yo!\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Review',\n",
       "  'description': 'In Phoenix Wright, players take the role of a young defense attorney straight out of law school, making his great debut. Along with five trial cases the game also features investigative segments where Phoenix accumulates evidence and testimony as patronage of his client\\'s case. These sections of the game usually bring forth drama and twists in the plot, as well as exposing some of Phoenix Wright\\'s backdrop. One of the game\\'s biggest strengths seems to be its wide array of characters. In the game you get a chance to meet some very unique personalities - from screwy characters like Larry Butz to unfortunate characters like Miles Edgeworth.  Immediately you\\'ll notice the gameplay consist of little action. It\\'s an extremely text heavy game, however, it makes up for it through quite an interesting plot. After all, who wants to buy a video game, broad in text, but refuses to deliver a great story? The script is surprisingly well written. It has to be one of the best of our time. It provides very humorous dialogue, and is very… scintillating.  Each of Phoenix Wright\\'s five cases split into two parts: the investigation, and the trial. Each case will also have an introductory scene that will establish the victim and the suspect. Your clients are left \"guilty, until proven innocent\". This means you\\'ve got to find all of the evidence, find the inconclusive, and interpret the witness\\' testimony to the prosecution\\'s case. The game takes freedom in how the legal system operates to make things more entertaining. For instance, a lawyer would normally not be allowed to sneak into a crime scene to gather more evidence, but in this game, due to Phoenix\\'s growing friendship with the detective, you\\'ll find you won\\'t have to worry; you won\\'t be disbarred. The investigative scenes usually involve Phoenix and his sidekick going to the scene of the crime, and attempting to get evidence. These parts are stylus driven, usually requiring close examination of several areas, and talking to witnesses, and drawing testimony or further evidence out of them (by pressing them on certain points, or presenting evidence at an appropriate time – this can be a slow and painful process in the latter cases). The final case gives players much greater level of interactivity, with fingerprinting and UV equipment for detecting finger prints and bloodstains. Eventually, the game\\'s linearity will kick back in, and it\\'ll be time to go to the courtroom.  The courtroom proceedings in Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney is based more around a civil law system, rather than a common law one. As a result, the judge is much more involved in the case. The judge in the game is often easily swayed by witnesses. The prosecution will run the witness through their account of the events, after which the player will have a shot at finding holes in the witness\\' testimony.  Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney uses a manga (Japanese graphic novel) style for the majority of its artwork, which suits the setting of the game near perfectly. I\\'m not much of an audiophile when it comes to in game sound effects, but the sound doesn\\'t seem to excel the way one would expect throughout the game. For the most part it it\\'s an easy on the ears, almost generic tone. It does tend to get a little more exciting when in the mist of a trial, however. Voice acting is done well, but very limited to the wails of \"Objection!\", \"Hold it!\", and \"Take that!\" by members of both defense and prosecution.  In the end you\\'ll find drawbacks little in amount for a game like Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. I would assume its only ones are the fact it provides an extremely linear experience, and the very little replay value, as they are the only minor disputes I\\'ve had with the game. Anyhow, Phoenix Wright is something owners of the DS should consider needing a little more investigation.',\n",

       "  'description': \"The Monkey Island series is considered by many people, including myself, as being the best adventure games (or games, for that matter) of all time. That's a big title to hold and if you've played the two previous games in the Monkey Island series, you should pretty much understand why these LucasArts classics got this title. But does the third game, The Curse of Monkey Island, live up to these high expectations?Of course it does! The Curse of Monkey Island sees our hero Guybrush Threepwood proposing to Elaine Marley with a big, diamond ring he found in LeChuck's treasure hold at the start of the game. Unluckily for Guybrush, the ring is cursed and it turns Elaine into a gold statue. Guybrush's aim is now to find a way to lift the curse (bring on the Voodoo lady!) and once again try and defeat LeChuck who is after the same women as he is!Returning characters include Stan and his crazy arms, Wally who is now a member of LeChuck's undead army (can Guybrush convert him back?) and where would a Monkey Island game be without the infamous Voodoo Lady?The artwork in this game (Bill Tiller, Maria Bowen, Kathy Hsieh) is an absoloute treat. The backgrounds are superb and have so many little details included in them, you could spend hours just staring at them and admiring it all.The sound and voicing is amazingly good and the difficulty of the game, although hard, is not impossible and will challenge you without getting you frustrated and shouting at the game!To round up, if you've played the first two Monkey Island games you can't rest until you've played this and if you've never played any Monkey Island game you can still play this and enjoy it, but you may not understand a couple of things unless you play the previous games.\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'Final Fantasy X-2 Review',\n",
       "  'description': 'In Final Fantasy X-2, Square-Enix attempts to continue the amazing plot that its predecessor, Final Fantasy X, had. It is now two years after the events of Final Fantasy X, and you now play as Yuna, who is accompanied by good friend Rikku, and new friend Paine. They, along with the Celsius\\' (their airship) personnel, form the motley crew known as \"The Gullwings\".  The Gullwings are full-time Sphere Hunters. These spheres play an integral part throughout the game. They provide vital information in the form of small video clips that contain tidbits of information. The spheres are also responsible for the journey\\'s beginning. In FFX-2\\'s prologue, Yuna has found a sphere showing someone who looks as if it\\'s Tidus, himself. The sphere, however, is of poor quality and she isn\\'t able to tell who \"he\" really is. Following her heart, she bets on the fact it is the real Tidus, and wants to know more. She then finds herself hot on the trail of clues and spheres leading her to this man, whoever he could be. Some spheres, contrary to the ones that hold information, are for use in Final Fantasy X-2\\'s renovated combat system. These are called \"Dress Spheres\". The dress sphere system in Final Fantasy X-2 is a revamped, but more flexible version of the classic job system. Each dress sphere allows you to cast different spells and unleash variant attacks on enemies. Unlike the old job system, however, the characters can actually change from one dress sphere to another in the midst of battle. Naturally you\\'ll have a variety of jobs to choose from. These include the Black, White, and Gun Mage, Gunner, Alchemist, Berserker, Dark Knight, Lady Luck, Mascot, Samurai, Songstress, Thief, and lest we forget, Warrior. Although it would be great to be able to use them all from the get-go, you must earn/find them on your own.  Each Gullwing (Yuna, Rikku, or Paine) get their own special Dress Sphere as well. To use them though, during battle you\\'d have to have done more than just have found and obtained it. You must go through each Dress Sphere assigned on the grid before you\\'re allowed to access the special one. In FFX-2, your spheres are assigned to certain grids, also found in game, each of its own use. Some boost your magic, while others add strength and/or defense. If you\\'re anxious to use Yuna/Rikku/Paine\\'s specialized dress sphere, you\\'ll want to tend the use of smaller grids, as they are all different in size (in terms of how many spheres can fit on one).  Along with a creative battle system come your imaginative enemies, each just as appealing, as the next. That’s not mentioning the beast you get to tame when the time comes. Final Fantasy X-2 also provides stellar visuals in and out of game play. The cut scenes give the great sense of realism, and each location\\'s (Besaid, Calm Lands, Mt. Gagazet, etc...) a look of authenticity. Each place, just by their looks, gives an accurate description of what is to come, or expect. For instance, looking at Mt.Gagazet you expect to see people of the Al Bhed race, or the Machina Faction (group of Al Bhed who use and build machines) hard at work, striving to advanced their technology.  Unfortunately, in Final Fantasy X-2 you learn to take the good with the bad. Final Fantasy X-2\\'s game play is less than entertaining, and not as fun as you\\'d expect from a Final Fantasy title. FFX-2, this time around, is more mission-based. How far you are into the game depends on what missions you are able to choose from. When aboard the Celsius you use the \\'Mission Select\\' screen to choose which area in Spira you would like to visit. While you are not bound to going certain places, there\\'s usually nothing better to do anywhere else, if there\\'s nothing in it for the player (i.e. spheres).  Places that are important and may contain spheres crucial to the plot would already be marked and identified on the map as a \"Hot Spot\". Each \\'Hot Spot\\' leads you to a quest, which most of the time ends up in the Gullwings receiving a sphere. This almost becomes repetitive as some of the quests seem like Square-Enix just wanted to give you something to do, instead of just letting the game hand the sphere over to you. Some of the quest are, in fact, fun and may break the chain of drab game play. For instance, I had a great deal of fun creating a team and playing a game of Blitzball. The game does have its high points, but the rest just seems, dare I say, filler. Seriously, why was I giving LeBlanc back rubs just to infiltrate her dysfunctional organization (The LeBlanc Syndicate)? FFX-2 has a lot of moments that would leave asking you, \"Why did I just do that?\" or \"What was the point of that?\"  The sweet sounds of Yuna\\'s singing should help numb it though. Aside from the usual sound effects of guns popping, and monsters roaring (which sounded great), the game was about as easy on the ears as it was on the eyes. At times the dialogue seemed more like \"Sweet Valley High\", than Final Fantasy, but it was...alright. Some of Brother\\'s (pilot of the Celsius) speech seemed a little too boyish though, more annoying than humorous. Other than that there couldn\\'t have been anymore complaints. The music playing in the mist of the background was, at times, soothing and released the stress of hours of searching for that one sphere. Also, at just the right times it seemed all sound, but Yuna\\'s footsteps were removed giving the game an audible depth. In essence the sound is a key ingredient, to the game.  I wouldn\\'t say the game has much replay value to it, or that it is up there with the some of the best RPGs out. It failed in the most important element of creating a great RPG, and that is game play. I touched on it earlier and the game play was just too repetitive, leaving no desire to play it over. It seemed it tried to make up for it, almost, in every other aspect of the game, but the FFX2 just didn\\'t do it for me. It wasn\\'t what I was expecting. Final Fantasy X-2 was just, overall, disappointing.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Contextualizing this review with the more than a decade since it\\'s release; Bushido Blade is still one of my all time favorite games. Amongst the throngs of fighting games from that time period Bushido Blade stood out as a breath of fresh air. Most fighting games had progressed down the route of complex combos and required much dedication to master and compete against others. This wasn\\'t the case with Bushido Blade, while there are some complex combos you can use, trying to memorize them carries a certain futility when you can be cut down with a single slice from a new comer.The game is based of a \"realistic\" sword fighting engine, one well timed attack could easily kill or maim your opponent. While one hit kills are common it\\'s not the rule of combat, more often then not there is a fair interplay between combatants that seems much more mature than any arcade style fighter. The absence of health meters, frantically animated backgrounds and\\xa0excessive\\xa0GUI elements all add to the poetic nature of the game. The paired down design and interface elements allowed more exposure to the sophistication of the game\\'s mechanics and allowed the combat to continue in a fluid motion. It would be easy to go through 20 matches in about 5 minutes, each match has less pre-amble and endurance than a match of Street Fighter (or the ilk), and from that the matches were quick and easy… perhaps like a real sword fight.The single player wasn\\'t very well developed or evolved compared to other story based games from the time. Slash mode was a great way to practice (or blow some steam) as you\\'d be attacked by 100 offending ninjas one by one; even though they were simple bots that progressively became better you could make it as challenging as you wanted. The real meat comes from the multiplayer fights, where you could really start to channel the essence of a battle (more than any other fighting game). This game has been left so unrivaled that friends and I will still get together to play on\\xa0occasion.There are 6 characters to choose from that\\xa0each represent a balance between speed and power, you then have a choice of 8 weapons that act differently in the hands of each character. While it\\'s fun to play with the combinations, some of the weapons are less balanced than others and make the attacks rather one-note. Often the most enjoyable matches were performed between two katana wielding ninja, which seemed like the most balanced and developed weapon of the lot. Which makes sense, what better way to capture a gaming moment akin to a sword fight from a Kurosawa movie?',\n",

       "  'description': 'Game Review: Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom SimMajesty was developed by Cyberlore Studios and published for Windows by MicroProse in 2000. An expansion pack was released later on as well, but this review will not take into account the additions made by the expansion pack.The basic gameplay is that of a real time strategy game except that it revolves around the fact that the player has no direct control over their \"Heroes\". These heroes can be hired by guilds that you build and are autonomous. The biggest way you can influence them is by placing flags on specific things you want them to go to, and tie a reward to it. This lack of control over what your heroes do might seem odd at first, but it works really well and adds to the charm of the game. Also, resource management is not present in the game, the only resource you have is gold which is collected by the tax collector from your buildings.In every level of the game you have some task such as \"Destroy the Evil Castle\" or \"Defend against the hordes of evil\". The things you have to do are quite interesting for the most part, although some of them are a bit dull such as \"Build a Fairground\" which involves just getting your palace up to level 3 and building it, not much action involved. But for the most part, the game offers interesting objectives.But we have yet to discuss the Hero AI, which is very important in this game. Basically, depending on the class of hero its behavior will change. The Rogue is more likely to go after bounties then a paladin. A paladin is more likely to fight an approaching monster than a gnome. A warrior of discord is more likely to do something stupid like fight a horde of monsters himself than......anyone else. You get the point.To complement the charm of the game is the voice acting, which is great. The game is narrated by...a Sean Connery impersonator? And all the hero voices sound great too. But more so than the voice acting itself, is the lines they say. There are lines in this game which I will never forget for the rest of my life. For instance, when a gnome finds an item it says \"I\\'ve always wanted one of theeeeeeeeese!\" but the gnome sort of sings it. I don\\'t think I will ever forget that one.The entire game has this sort of.........amazing charm. It is a mixture of the gameplay, the voice acting, the music and everything else that makes this game so classic for me.Also, like in Dungeon Keeper there is one building that, when destroyed, makes you lose the game. That building is the palace ( Dungeon Heart in Dungeon Keeper ) and its level also determines what buildings you can construct. For instance the temples in the game can be made when you upgrade your palace to level 2. There are also the non-human races that will only be made available once your settlement fulfills some requirements.The difficulty is actually quite hard, but only once you get into the later levels. And the \"Master\" levels are really quite difficult.If you manage to beat all the levels, you can derive even more joy out of the game via the Freestyle Game option. Using this you can make a random map and play it, which is a very nice addition that is surprisingly absent from a lot of games ( Black and White 1 and 2 come to mind ).The graphics are...well...old. That is to be expected from a game that is indeed old. But if you are the kind of person who can pick up an old game, then you won\\'t mind the graphics ( Which although weak does have its own charm, especially the character portraits ).The music is good, although I have to say that the game could have had a few more songs. Other than that, it is pretty good overall.So there you have it, I love this game. Although perhaps not as good as Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons / Ages it is still a great experience. I urge anyone who likes strategy games to play this.Overall Rating: 5/5',\n",

       "  'description': 'Change is always risky business. It can bring in a much needed breath of fresh air to an established franchise, or it can damage a long-time fan favourite beyond recognition.Call of Duty 4: Modern Combat is definitely a step in the right direction, and manages to both make the series feel fresh while still retaining the elements that made the previous instalments so popular. The big change Infinity Ward (Call of Duty 1 & 2) made is the changing to a modern setting. No longer is the series set in the played out WWII. No more storming the beach of Normandy or tearing down Berlin. No more firing single shots with inaccurate rifles. In exchange we get high-tech weapons with a great feel to them, new locations and a nuke.But although there is a cosmetic change and new gadgets, CoD 4 still retains its biggest trademark; a powerful, action-packed experience filled to the brim with well-scripted events. And that’s not a bad thing.The story does a pretty good job of engaging the player. Much of this comes from the fact that the game never lets the tension slow down one second to let you take a breath. It’s a powerful experience from start to finish, even if you don’t find the story particularly engaging, there is no denying the quality work that has been laid here by Infinity Ward.You are placed in the shoes of both a US and British soldier, in the fight against a terrorist leader bent on causing all out war with the west. It’s pretty simple, but well executed and scripted events throughout the campaign make it far more interesting than on paper. It also never feels like the characters take easily on the events going on around them. It is definitely a gritty story, and from time to time you will find yourself leaning forward, trying to soak it all in. Although the story is focused on the Middle-East, you also get to clean out Russian houses in the night, sink a boat in the Atlantic and level a village with a helicopter. It’s a pretty diverse experience, although a short lived one. The whole thing clocks in at about 5-7 hours, depending on skill and difficulty. It makes the campaign far from repetitive, but also makes you wish there actually was something to repeat.The story in this game, although perfectly fine, is nothing compared to the graphics the game sports. The models of characters, textures of foliage and the animations are all of high quality. When the commander stands up besides you in the ghillie-suit without you even knowing he was there, you cannot help but be in awe each time. Bombs, shots and explosions all have a proper bang to them, and seem to do some real damage to the world, and are very satisfying to use. Even more impressive is the fact that even in big battles, with tons of bullets and grenades flying everywhere, the framerate doesn’t dip. With short loadtimes only existing at the start of the level, this is even more impressive. You could say that due to the limitations in exploration, there is less high-def textures to draw in, but it is still one of the best looking games on the 360.Something that the series always has had is big battles, but still confining you to a linear path through the level. This still stands true here. Although a few levels give you multiple objects in a slightly larger field, the majority of the game will lead you through a limited path with just enough wiggle room to not feel too constricted. If the linear nature of the series has plagued you before, nothing here will change that feeling, although it feels much grander in size compared to previous instalments. Nowhere in the game is the boundaries of your surroundings more clear then in a stealth-run through Chernobyl in the 1980’s. Here you must follow your commanders’ orders without hesitation. There’s a tiny to non-existing possibility to improvise through the level, but the intensity of that level still makes it enjoyable, as is the case with most of the rest of the game. It is clear Infinity Ward has no intention of revolutionising the genre, but rather perfect what works, which they do an excellent job of here.After completing the campaign you unlock “arcade mode”. This works in the same way as Halo 3’s meta-game in that you get points for completing levels quickly and effective. You get points for kills (more points for difficult shots), multipliers both for difficulty and avoiding using up the limited number of extra lives. Higshscores are posted on leaderboards, and helps make this a fun addition. This mode works well in CoD 4’s design, due to its short levels and focused gameplay, although this is a mere diversion compared to the brilliant multiplayer that follows.The multiplayer portion is very well crafted. It’s full of depth, but the first time you start playing, your options are very limited. You can choose deathmatch, team deathmatch and that’s about it. You get a limited choice of classes, but what you get will do just fine. But very quickly, your xp bar fills up from basically anything you do, such as kills, wins and supports. Each level does a fine job of giving you more and more options, and after few hours of play, all gametypes, classes and the enjoyable create-a-class is unlocked. And there are tons of gametypes. Sabotage, king of the hill variations and some other quirky modes make for a diverse list. And although there are so many options, players are never a problem to find.But of all you unlock, create-a-class is definitely a big part in the entertainment here. Here you get to build your own fighter, except his appearance. One of the defining parts of this is the perks-system. Perks, three per character, are basically abilities, much like spells in RPG’s, and let’s you tweak your character to fit your playstyle. One perk, called Last Stand, let’s you pull of some shots with your sidearm before you bleed out. This can get you a revenge kill for double the experience, and can be extremely satisfying. Others include dropping a live grenade when killed, double firerate and giving you a RPG for shooting down helicopters. The many perks are fun to play around with, and unlock on a regular basis. The interesting part is that the high-level perks never feel like being too powerful, just gives you wider range of options to tweak. This makes for pretty balanced playfield between beginners and long time players to kill each other on, and you will do a lot of that. If you manage to kill multiple foes in a row, support comes into play. Kill 3 people in a row, and you get radar which scans the entire map for enemy positions, 5 kills lets you target an area for an airstrike. Get 7 kills, and a helicopter swoops around the map for a while, gunning down enemies in the open. The supports make for exiting gameplay, and can turn the tide of a battle if used properly, but never feel unbalanced. The helicopter can be shot down, a perk keeps you off the radar and the airstrike is very area-specific. There are a good variety of maps, continuous unlocks and challenges to complete, which keep the multiplayer staying fresh even after weeks of play.Soundwise, CoD 4 is no slacker either. Weapons sound appropriately vicious, your squadmates sounds just right to be believable, and the music kicks in when it’s supposed to.The scripted events are already well choreographed, and with the fittingly pompous music adding to the experience, this is definitely a game that benefits from a good surround system.In a year that has included such behemoths as The Orange Box, Halo 3 and Bioshock, making a first person shooter that not only matches these great games, but also stands out is no easy feat. Call of Duty 4 manages to stand proudly with these giants, and is well worth your money and time With a exciting, although short lived campaign, leaderboards for score-junkies and an incredible multiplayer component, this is truly a shooter you owe to yourself to buy, and is definitely stands as one of 2007’s finest.',\n",

       "  'description': 'In this next installment Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life continues it\\'s, what I like to call, underground hit. At first glance, the game is very misleading. People tend to fall under the stereotypical, nonsecular belief that Harvest Moon is a child\\'s game. In all actuality, the game simply provides one of the best, and most addictive, gaming experiences anyone could enjoy.  To be honest, the game doesn\\'t improve upon much, but that was expected. For years now Harvest Moon has been releasing game after game, without many changes or adds any new elements, which jump out at the players right away. It\\'s as they say, \"If it\\'s not broke, don\\'t fix it.\"  Harvest Moon delivers a great story. You play as a young boy who\\'s left to maintain the farm by his father. The story is told and narrated by an old man who helps you keep the farm alive and growing the way the boy\\'s father had intended him to. This leads to the amazing gameplay that makes Harvest Moon what it is.   Classed as a Role-Playing Game, it doesn\\'t play like most RPGs out there, if any. Instead of building your character, you\\'re building the farm. Who knew living the life of a farmer, especially through video games, had any excitement to it? Now, if you still aren\\'t convinced that you would enjoy maintaining a farm, look at it this way; At least you get paid, so you may enjoy some of the finer things the game has to offer. Soon you\\'ll stay on your grind, cropping, milking and nesting. Don\\'t get too caught up, though. I can attest to the fact this game is very addictive. Hours will fly by unnoticed. You\\'ll play by day, and before you know it, you\\'ll be playing by night.   Farming isn\\'t everything, however, on the land of Forget-Me-Not. There are many other things to keep you occupied. Go fishing, try selective breeding animals, hell - cross breed the crops. Cook, why don\\'t you? You are on a farm. Did you seriously think you wouldn\\'t have to know the culinary arts? You don\\'t have to be near the farm all day, either. Go have a drink with the guys. Yes, Harvest Moon lets you do all of this, and much more. You may interact with many other inhabitants, and when you feel you\\'ve been in Forget-Me-Not a little too long, hook up Mineral Town from your GBA. It\\'s an amazing way to let you interact with others, and an amazing aspect of this game.  As said before, you are living out the life of a farmer. That\\'s more than just taking care of your farm, though. It\\'s finding a wife, creating a child, and continuing to watch over your farm.  Visually speaking, the game is stunning. There is a tremendous amount of detail, and the characters all have that \"chibi\" look (anime\\'s rendition of dwarf characters). This style was, no doubt, inspired by games early in the Harvest Moon series. The lighting was all done perfectly, adding an ambience to the game\\'s setting. Also setting the game\\'s tone very well is the music played through out the game. You may even enjoy it.  Overall, Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life is an amazing game. The game in and of itself is truly an experience, and one to remember. Games such as this go under appreciated, but you\\'ll find yourself very proud to be one of its fans, seeing as the game plays a low profile in the industry.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Game Review: Half Life 2: Episode 1 Half Life 2: Episode 1 was released in 2006, and is the first part of a three part trilogy that essentially are meant to be Half Life 3. Several major changes to the Source engine such as better facial animation and graphics overall make the graphics seem like HL2, just given a little boost. While it can be bought and played without having HL2 installed, the game is so story driven that you are really missing out if you don\\'t play the original HL2. The story picks off right where HL2 ended. You have done critical damage to the Combine citidel and get whisked away by the G-Man. However the Vortigaunts, some alien friends you who were killing in Half Life 1 but became friends with in HL2, enter the G-Man\\'s realm and muck up his plans, teleporting you back to the real world. The story is just as good as the other Half Life games, great. The voice acting gives it a real good atmosphere and overall makes the game more appealing. This time around however, you have a companion to tag along with you every step of the way. And that companion is Alyx Vance, Gordon\\'s friend/love interest. She is designed perfectly, and unlike those pesky rebel soldiers you have helping you out later in HL2, she isn\\'t annoying either. There are lots of cool nuances to the A.I as well. For instance, there are some points in the game where if you turn of your flashlight, she will make zombie noises to scare you. She also packs a punch with the gun she is toting, so there are several instances where it is she who is doing the shooting and you who does something like solve a puzzle. Alyx Vance really adds a lot to the gameplay in my opinion, and she is a really great addition to the gameplay. The weapons are the same as before. This is one area that I wish they could have done better in. I expected at least a few cool new weapons for Episode 1 but they decided not to add any. That\\'s fine given the fact that all the HL2 weapons are superb, but just for the sake of putting more in they could have tossed us a mega super sound emitting gun or something.... Graphics are an improved version of those found in HL2. There were several big updates to the source engine made after Half Life 2 was released, such as HDR and also improved facial animation technology. This makes Episode 1 a slightly better looking game that HL2 was. Sound is the same as Half Life 2, no better no worse. Voice acting is good as usual. Overall the game is great, but is not quite as good as HL2, perhaps only because it is a whole lot shorter. Half Life 1 is like half the length of a regular game, but it is also far cheaper. It is part of a trilogy that as a whole can be considered \"Half Life 3\" so it is forgivable. In the end, it\\'s not the greatest the series has been but it does set up nicely for the superior sequel, Half Life 2: Episode 2I\\'ll give this game a 4.5/5',\n",

       "  'description': 'EA have been churning out Need for Speed games for ages now and some could say the series is now getting dry and crusty, and they need to just hide the license in a cupboard. I say that\\'s rubbish, and Need for Speed Most Wanted is the best in the NFS series so far - and that\\'s saying something.The game has two main modes - career and challenge. Career sees you taking the role of a street racer who is slowly trying to make his way up the blacklist to become the ultimate racer. The number one blacklister is Razor who will do anything to stop you stealing his position and taking his glory. To gain higher places in the list, you will have to complete a series of racing events along the way such as sprints, circuits and so on. You will also need to rack up your bounty, which you earn by smashing up the police cars and various other things. Challenge mode sees you simply doing what it says on the tin - completing challenges to unlock cars.Police chases are a great excitement and feature in this game. The ability level of the police cars depends on how long you have been avoiding them for. The final stage is where the police boss comes in which involves some hilarious things that he says broadcasted in your car radio (\"get the foo!\"). The adrenalin when racing is huge but can be very annoying when you\\'ve been going for ages and you get busted.Graphically the game is amazing and if you have a high-end PC you can really get the full deal from the game (360 visuals). The city is visually very good and you never get the feeling that you\\'ve seen that before in another part of the city. The cars also look as photo-realistic as they can come at the moment which is a very hard thing to pull off.Overall, Most Wanted is just what the series needed. From it\\'s fast paced street races, to it\\'s tense and action packed police chases, this is one racing game you really should put on your shopping list. ',\n",

I'll keep it short and  simple:Gameplay: 10 (5 stars)Sound: 10 (5 stars)Graphics: 10 (5 stars)Lasting  Appeal: 10 (5 stars)Overall: 9.9 (5 stars)Now I'm sure you're asking, how can I give  it 10s in all the major categories and give it an overall score of 9.9. Well,  it's simple...nothing in this world is perfect and although MGS4 comes close it  gets a 9.9 due to the fact that this is Snake's last epic and crazy journey. I  wish Kojima would create another follow up title, but he has stated that this  will be the last one he produces and Snake's final mission which hurts me. Thank  you Kojima for the 20+ years and thank you for giving the world a look into your  crazy world. You are a great storyteller and I know I will personally miss the  ride that is Metal Gear.Anyone with a PS3 will love the experience that  is MGS4 and fans of the series will not be disappointed until you realize that  it's over.

       "  'description': 'Give me back my time! Ok, it wasn\\'t even much time I have \"lost\", but after that ending I\\'m just furious with rage. Oh, the pointlessness. And don\\'t get me started on the money I\\'ve spent. I will try to give it back tomorrow and say that my PC couldn\\'t run it... Lost is without a doubt one of the best written and most intriguing series out there and season four contained some of the best moments I\\'ve ever had watching TV. But this has nothing to do with Lost: Via Dum**ss. When I read the first reviews I didn\\'t want to believe it. I thought you had to review it from two perspectives: as a gamer and as a Lostfan. Sure, it would be a bad game, if you had never watched an episode. You shouldn\\'t bother with playing it, because the game requires you to have at least some knowledge about the Island. But I thought that Losties would just love it. I just finished the game and it was so incredibly disappointing that it inspired me to write my first review ever.  I\\'ll start with the (few) good things: Apart from the graphics which are fine (most characters look like the actors and the Island is beautiful), the only good thing about the game is the main character. I can\\'t remember how often I\\'ve played a game with the amnesia scenario and it has been done better but the history you get in the flashbacks fits with Lost. He has flaws and finally overcomes them which is just very lostlike. At least that\\'s what i thought before I saw the ending.  **spoilerrant**  Whoever made this game (and I hope neither Cuse nor Lindelof had something to do with it) found this nice trick so you don\\'t have to bother with the question if it\\'s canon or not. Afterwards, everything is questionable. There\\'s absolutely no point in the whole game: Amnesia (cliché but ok) - You find out something about the past of the character (that\\'s just how those games work)- everything you just found out was a dream?!? And it\\'s not like in the movie \"Identity\" where at the end you realize that something really cool just happened and have to watch the movie again, no! Everything you did, everything you learned is redundant. And when I saw the plane crash over Eliott I thought it had something to do with a timerift. Now that would have saved the game.  **end of spoilerrant** The gameplay is just as pointless as the story. It consists of mostly running. And then there are two different kinds of puzzles: \"finish that sequence\" and some minigame where you have to put different fuses in a panel to blah blah blah. Both are way too easy. No adventureelements, no real multiple choice dialogue, no sneaking and definately no good action. You pick up stuff all over the island so you can trade with sawyer. But the only things you\\'ll ever need are a lamp, max four cans of oil for it and the gun. Don\\'t buy any ammo. I only shot two guys. Two!! I bought 90 rounds of whoopie! So the tradesystem is broken as well. At least the controls work. With a Xbox360 gamepad that is. What made the game even worse was that they tried to put as much famous quotes from the series in there as possible. It just feels so forced and phoney. Which leads me to the voices. The characters whose actors weren\\'t available were done by standins. But I think you already read enough about how ridiculous they sound. The music although is ok.   So let\\'s sum it up: graphics are good, music is ok, voices bad, gameplay none, story none, replayvalue -1. This is nothing but a piece of bad merchandise. A total ripoff. Don\\'t buy this game. Don\\'t even rent it. Heck, don\\'t even download it. I only gave it more than one point because of its graphics and it\\'s bugfree (yay)',\n",

Putting an end to a legend is never an easy thing to do. He did it with style and his own brand of humor. While maintaining an extremely poignant, somewhat relevant overview of what the future of war may soon become if some action is not taken. Along the way we feel sorrow for Snake, but the overtone of the story is a positive one. The ending is epic and really rewards the player with a fantastic climax to a series that almost seemed impossible to wrap up. As good as the game looks... the sound design is better and is truly the first game in this generation to blow me away with the level of detail they took in getting the sound design correct. Combine that with the fact that this game uses some of the best \"rumble\" that I\\'ve ever experienced in a game (which is bad news if you are not an owner of the $55 Dual Shock 3) and this game is nothing short of awe-inspiring.

The game is fun while it lasts... but sadly, that really isn't long and the replay factor just isnt' there - not even for parties, where you would whip out something like Wario Ware: Smooth Moves.Wii Play makes a big use of the Miis and pulls it off quite well - it is fun to see your own Mii riding on the back of a cow or being told to find one of your friends or family in a bunch of loads of other Miis. Wii Play's games are mainly mediocre, with a few semi-decent ones and a few being just plain awful. The highlight of the whole package is the billiards which has the most thought out and planned controls - however, I did find the pushing the remote forward to hit the ball a pain sometimes as it wouldn't register the movement because my arm wasn't dead straight. Apart from this though, the game is good.Games such as 'Find Mii' and 'Pose Mii' really get boring after a while and you don't feel any urge at all to go back and beat your score, mainly because it is just so repitive. The tanks game is another highlight, the only game to use the nunchuk (optional, but I would highly reccomended you do use it) which sees you shooting down enemy tanks on a flat 2D maze landscape.For £5 the game is decent and you may as well buy it, and you may as well by it if not only for the controller.

       "  'description': 'Grand Theft Auto 4 is the first installment on  the next-gen consoles in the GTA franchise from Rockstar. It stars Eastern  European Niko Bellic as the main protagonist, who is in route to Liberty City to  meet up with his cousin Roman Bellic. Roman has sent numerous emails and letters  to Niko and his mother about how he is living the \"American Dream\". He informs  them that he has penthouse sweets, beautiful women, exotic fast cars and lots of  money, but upon arrival in Liberty City, Niko discovers that his cousin\\'s tales  of greatness are mearly delusions of grandeur. After inserting the game  disc, you are required to perform a ten minute install. Although this will be  the most agonizing ten minutes of your life, Rockstar provides a booming title  track instrumental that\\'s crazy. It will keep you entertained and adds to the  anticipation of what Liberty City has in store for you the third time around.  Although the game is supposed to function better with the mandatory install, the  only gripe I have with this feature (in regards to all games) is why not allow  the choice of performing the install to the user? Some people like the  functionality and some people just want to play. I would\\'ve figured that with  such a huge title Rockstar would have allowed the choice...but I  digress...Although GTA4 does not have the beautiful and realistic  visuals of a COD4, Uncharted, Bioshock or Gears of War, graphically, the game  looks great and is by far the best looking GTA game to date! But as we all know  the Grand Theft Auto series has not been known for its graphics...it\\'s known for  its gameplay...and the gameplay does not disappoint. The game feels and handles  like the traditional GTA we\\'ve grown found of on the PS2 but an evolved version  that stresses realism for the next-gen consoles. Last gen, stealing cars were  easy as all car doors seemed to be unlocked with keys in the ignition. Now, the  majority of car doors are locked and if this is the case, the only way to get in  is by smashing the window and then hotwiring the car. You can still pull off  classic dashboard head smashes and kicks to the face when jackin fools, but you  can also point your gun at passengers and they\\'ll willing give up their  car...unless they\\'re packin too. Vehicles handle like their real world  counterparts so no more taking 90 degree turns doing 100mph. This is initially  one of the biggest areas to master, but after playing for a few hours you really  get a sense of how different cars handle. Another small addition is if you\\'re  doing 100mph and you crash into a wall, Niko will fly through the windshield,  which is a hilarious scene to watch. There are numerous other tweaks they made  to the game to separate it from it\\'s predecessors, but I will let you experience  it for yourself.Liberty City looks great and Rockstar created a near  carbon copy of a vivrant and lively New York City. Brooklyn (Broker), Manhattan  (Algonquin), the Bronx (Bohan), Queens (Dukes), Liberty Island (Happiness  Island), Coney Island (Colony Island) and New Jersey (Alderney) are represented  well in traditional GTA fashion with distorted but familiar knockoff  names.The audio is top notch as Rockstar pulled in a whole array of  unknown voice talent to voice the millions of people within Liberty City. This  fact is displayed in full at the conclusion of the game when the credits roll.  The radio stations are superb and better (IMO) than the majority of radio  stations available in most major cities. The music genre covers pretty much all  popular music current in the industry such as: hip hop (current), hip hop  (underground/classic), r&b, reggae (dancehall), reggae (dub), electronic,  rock and roll, reggaeton and a number of comical talk stations. One of  the newest and probably the biggest new feature is the inclusion of multiplayer  to the game. There\\'s more to be desired from the online modes, but I will not  penalize Rockstar on their first attempt. It\\'s playable and at its best when  running through the entire city causing mayhem with a group of friends. The  ability to run around Liberty City with friends was a great feature and should  be continued in future multiplayer modes.Overall, Grand Theft Auto 4  makes a wonderful and memorable appearance on the next-gen consoles that  everybody should play (2008 Game of the Year...cough cough) but it is not  without it\\'s faults. Although they are nearly outweighed by the greatness found  within the game, the downside issues still rear their ugly heads which can deter  from an enjoyable afternoon of creating havoc in the city. The biggest problem  that is noticeable is game freezes or lockups. Initially this was thought to be  a 60Gb PS3 exclusive issue, but this same problem is arising on multiple SKUs  not only on the Playstation but Xbox 360 as well. Hopefully Rockstar will create  a firmware update to correct this, but only time will tell. Aside from the  freezing this game is hands down one of the best next-gen experiences to date  and has alot of supporting votes as 2008 Game of the Year. Any fan of the GTA  series or owners of a PS3 or Xbox 360 should definitely pick this game up. Aside  from the occasional game freeze, you won\\'t be disappointed with this sequel one  bit!Final Score: 9.2 (~4.5 stars) ',\n",

       "  'description': 'Spyro is one of those game characters that everyone in the gaming world will know about, even if they have never played the game. Although he isn\\'t as famous as a certain \"it\\'s-a-me\" plumber character, he is still recognised as being a gaming legend.Spryo: Year of the Dragon is the third in the Spyro series and it doesn\\'t disappoint at all. There is nothing particularly unfamiliar here - Spyro is followed by his dragonfly buddy Sparx, Spyro collects gems and eggs, Spyro breathes fire, runs, glides and flies. Is this a bad thing, though? Not at all. You start off in a main \\'world\\', with different portals leading off to different worlds. These portals are unlocked by collecting a certain number of eggs which are found in all the worlds or by giving a certain number of gems to Mr. Money Bags. Eggs can be collected by finding them or earning them as rewards for completing tasks or doing well in mini-games such as a wicked skating boarding game. When Spyro has collected the required number of eggs he can then defeat the boss and move onto the next main \\'world\\'.In some of the worlds you can play as different characters with their own abilities. There is an Australian kangaroo called Sheila who can double jump and kick enemies. There is also Sergeant Bird who has rocket launchers and can fly for as long as he wants. There is also a monkey and a big yeti, of whom I forget the names of (apologies!).For a Playstation game, Spyro looks superb in all ways, has great voice acting and a interesting story line. Year of the Dragon really is a classic platformer and you can\\'t miss out on one of Spyro\\'s best games.',\n",

       "  'description': \"The Orange Box, by Valve, is a compilation of 5 games in one box. The game are the original Half-Life 2, Episode 1, Episode 2, Portal, and Team Fortress 2. Out of the 5 games, 3 are brand new, but on this is he first time any of them have been on an Xbox 360, with exception of the Half-Life 2 port for the original Xbox (which sucked. alot.). Half-life 2 and its runty children are part of the Half-Life saga which pits Gordan Freeman, the silent protagonist, against the evil might of the Combine. The games are up to the Valve level of quality, featuring intense cinematic fights and clever physics based puzzles. Speaking of physics, there is A LOT OF IT. Even though the Source engine, is starting to show its shortcomings in graphical areas, the physics is flatout amazing. Just throwing things around with the Gravity Gun is magnificent fun. Things seem to have real weight and gravity can be a real bitch. There is nothing more satisfying than launching a washing machine at a Combine soldier at point blank and having them fly across the room. But what really makes the Half-Life saga worth it is the story. The characters seem real and it is extremely convincing when they talk to you. They display real emotions and give the story and even the gameplay real depth.Another game in this great package is Portal. Portal is simply amazing. It's a portal based puzzle shooter. The story is fascinating. Valve does a really good job with tone in this game. You get the feel that you are being watched, even though there isn't a single human in this game. Just an AI. GLaDOS, the AI, has a creepy resemblance to HAL9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Needless to say, some of the puzzles are god-damn amazing. Portal is a definitely a one game whose sequel I can't wait for.Team Fortress 2 is the multiplayer component to an already spectacular package. It is a class-based team shooter. The look and feel of TF2 is like a cartoon... until you start shooting. This is one the goriest games I have ever played. It has more limb severing than a meat-shop. That being said, it has a cute cartoony tone with some hilarious characters. The shooting is fun too. You feel like you are actually part of the team.All and all, The Orange Box, by Valve, is an amazing package that anyone who even slightly enjoys shooters MUST get.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is a First Person Shooter created by Infinity  Ward. After a boat load of FPS' s set during the WWII timeframe, COD4 breaks the  mold and places you within various environments (mainly urban) during modern  times. This is a HUGE change as it gives the game a unique fresh feeling.  Personally, FPS' are not my forte, however, after playing this game my feelings  for the genre began to change. Somebody who is not a fan of FPS' can  complete the single player campaign on normal in a little over six hours. It  will seem shorter than that due to the fact that the game is so faced paced and  well stylized that you become totally immersed in the ordeal. Graphically, the  game is stunning and can be arguably called the best visual experience on a  console yet. Most models within the game represent their real world counterparts  very well. The physics engine is very good as smoke, explosions, dust, gravity,  etc. all behave as if you're in a real world war zone. The only hitch I have with  the game (noticed during the sniper mission) is that the grass doesn't perform  how you'd expect. I would've loved to see it sway in the wind and flow as if it  had life to it, but it just stands still. This isn't a big issue and doesn't  take away from the overall experience at all, however, it was a deflating moment  for me personally.On a brief tangent, all I have to say is that I loved  the sniper mission. I was completely immersed in the situation especially when I  entered the open field. The fast paced action until the moment you're rescued is  top notch and definitely one of the high points during the single player  campaign.The sound effects and voice acting are great. The voice actors  do a wonderful job and perform as if you're watching a five star war  flick...very believe able. The AI will flank your position throw grenades you  threw at them and generally put a good fight throughout the campaign and helps  contribute to the long lasting impression of the game. The game's online  modes flourishes and makes for one of the best multiplayer experiences to date.  You can request your friends to join your party, which is not too common on many  PSN games (unfortunately) and take on the world through the traditional game  modes such as: Capture the Flag, Death Match and Team Death Match. You rank up  after receiving experience points, which is key to your success within the game.  Once you rank up you can unlock better weapons and upgrade the various classes,  which in the long run will give you better tools to destroy your foes and claim  domination over all!!! If you're a fan of First Person Shooters or titles with  great gameplay, Call of Duty 4 is a title definitely worth checking out. \",\n",

       "  'description': 'Game Review: Half Life 2: Episode 2Episode 2 was released October 10th 2007 as part of the Orange Box. It was one of the 3 new games released for the first time in the Orange Box. It met massive critical acclaim, and was praised as the best the Half Life series had ever been. Like Episode 1, improvements for the Source Engine had happened that were not available to the previous game. The major improvement is even more advanced facial animation technology.The story is awesome. Basically without giving too much away, you and Alyx Vance have destroyed the Combine fortress and now you two must bring something back to your rebel comrades residing in a facility called \"White Forrest\". Now that the Combine Fortress is destroyed however, it has opened a super-portal which will act as a mega-highway for Combine reinforcements if it is allowed to mature. Of course, the Rebels have other plans. That \"Something\" that you and Alyx have can stop the Combine from opening that portal of theirs, but the remaining Combine running amok around the land aren\\'t going to make it easy for you to get to your destination, especially these beings known as \"Advisers\" which have telepathic powers and seem to be wildly deformed. There is some speculation that these creatures might actually be the original Combine race and that they using their vast power slowly subjugated other species.Anyway, enough about story, let\\'s get onto beating stuff up shall we? There really isn\\'t much new when it comes to killing stuff in Half Life 2: Episode 2. You have all your regular weapons obviously, with no real new additions to the arsenal. You do have a car though.The car is the biggest addition. And this isn\\'t that car you had before, it\\'s a worn out muscle car. And it\\'s pretty awesome too. Since you spend lots of the game with Alyx, and a car, it gave me more of an adventurous feel.The graphics are easily the best in the Half Life series. Especially one scene where the G-Man gets a chance to have a little heart to heart chat with you. Facial animation is even better than that of Half Life 2: Episode 1 so you can kind of guess that it is really good. Also, the environments look really nice, and it seems they got an upgrade too. There is a lot of detail in all of them, and it just feels overall like they took a bit more time than with the previous games to make sure everything looked the way it should.The sound is the same, voice acting is top notch as always. I always did want some better sound effects for when the Antlions fly at you but that\\'s just me being picky.The game does introduce some new characters, but I won\\'t introduce them here. They are all cool and have a lot of depth to them. The romance side-story thing between Alyx and Gordon seems to progressing ever further, which is always welcome.The game is short, really short. About 6 hours I would assume. If you are looking for some epic adventure, you should look elsewhere. Nevertheless, as a part of the Orange Box it makes sense, and individually the game is like 20 bucks. I highly recommend you buy the game, it is fantastic, even if a bit on the short sideIn the Orange Box score: 5/5Individually: 4.5/5 (Because of it\\'s length) ',\n",

       "  'description': \"Dragon Quest VIII, much in line with the Dragon Quest games of Japanese fame, is a very traditional RPG. It is turn based, with a set 4 person party, consisting of the hero, the heavy damage/weapons man, the mage, and a character that can be customized as a healer/mage/fighter or any combination of all 3. There is the traditional gaining of EXP, and leveling up, and for every time you level up, you are given a\\xa0certain number of skill points you can assign to\\xa05 different categories.\\xa0Visually, the game is very exciting and looks fantastic, with a highly stylized/anime look. The game is incredibly long, and you will definitely get your moneys worth if you're looking for a good timeless RPG. Now, what can also be looked at as either a strength or its weakness, is its\\xa0extremely\\xa0steep\\xa0difficulty curve.\\xa0From the beginning, and I mean as SOON as you start the game, the game becomes very difficult. Each random ecounter can become a life threatening fight for survival, which continues to the very end of the game and beyond. Fortunately, the game is very forgiving about death, and will start you back at the local church with only the consequence of losing half your coins. There is a slight issue of framerate when there are too many enemies on the screen, the game slows down a tiny bit, but that is easily forgiven when compared to the rest of the package. The Audio is fantastic, with full orchestral pieces that are very fitting to the overall game. If you're looking for a great traditional RPG system that is simple and easy to pick up and learn, this is a great game, even in this generation, because there simply is no better substitute. \",\n",

       "  'description': 'RPG\\'s are one of the hardest type of games to get into. Due to their usually lengthy Story, very involved gameplay and numerous quests, you either fall for it hard or you give up in the first hour or so.\\xa0\\xa0 With this game being the biggest reason I got an 360, I was pretty afraid I\\'d be sorely disappointed by it. But over a hundred hours, 4 characters and 1050 achievement points\\xa0 later I think I can safely say this game blew me and my tiny little mind away.Since the story is detailed on the main gamepage I\\'m not gonna go into too much detail. You play as a SPECTER named Shepard who has to track down a Rouge SPECTRE named Saren who\\'s using a army of synthetic dudes called \"the Geth\" to look for something. What that thing is and why he\\'s doing it is up to you to find out.\\xa0\\xa0 It\\'s safe to say that the story and exspecially the dialouge are the best things about this game. Instead of opting for the usual \"Humanity finds aliens and they fight\",\\xa0 Bioware has created a..... ugh \"rich fiction\" about the history of the races and how they all interact wiht eachother. Each of dose or so speacies have a detailed description of their background, political viepoints, general behaviour, ecenomy etc etc. \\xa0You really feel like the species are real, they have their pros and cons and with the Council being reletively new you feel like not everyone is getting along.The conversation wheel is probably the biggest this game has. There is a learning curve for how the conversations work but after 1 playthrough or so you\\'ll be able to dance through every conversation no problem. add top-notch writing, great characters and believable voicework and you\\'ve got a solid gameplay mechanic.Unfortunaly, this game is bogged down by alright shooting, some painfull design decisions and a host of bugs wich have turned many players away from ever finishing this game. The shooting is clunky at times, sometimes you\\'re just ahnihilating your opponets with a pistol but a few moments later they make mincemeat out of you while your assault riffle does almost nothing to them. But thankfully biotic and tech ability\\'s make up for that (most of the time) with fun and effective abilities. \\xa0\\xa0 The main vehicle in this game, the Mako, suffers from some of those problems with the varying difficulty but thanks to it\\'s wonky handling and awful, awful turret controls the vehicle parts become one of the most annoying parts in the game.\\xa0\\xa0 The design issues don\\'t stop there. Coupled with the sometimes infuriating combat is the most useless and broken autosave system in any game game made. Save points are few and far between and with the ability to\\xa0 save anywhere you want outside of combat it\\'s practically useless. If you forget to save often you can loose almost a hour of progress wich is pretty much inexcuseable. \\xa0\\xa0 The inventory system is a hassle to manage and it is so hard to maintain order there that most player will probably never know how it even works at all.\\xa0\\xa0 And to top it all of, there are a bunch of techincal issues (this is running on UE3, mind you) like texture pop-ins. frequent framerate drops,\\xa0 system lock-ups and loooooooong load timesBut despite all that I adore this game. I haven\\'t been so intrigued and amazed by a game since Ocarina Of Time and no ammount of texture pop-ins and 3 week long elevator rides can spoil that. There is absolulely no guaranty you\\'ll like this game, even if you liked every other game Biowares done you are just as likely to hate it. But who knows, maybe you\\'ll be just as amazed by this game as I was. ',\n",

       " {'deck': 'Samus could have saved the GameCube. If anyone knew she was there',\n",
       "  'description': 'With its stunning production quality, sublimely intuitive controls, and immersive atmosphere; this game is true to the vision of series creator Gunpei Yokoi, and adds considerable layers of depth to its meta-narrative.Metroid games have always done things differently. The entire series seems to straddle the genres of shooter, platformer, and adventure. The first Metroid game to take place in three dimensions continues this trend of bucking trends. One of the trends it bucks is narrative sequence! Metroid Prime takes place just after the events of METROID. Which is kind of odd when you consider that the previous entries into the series were called: METROID, Metroid II, and Metroid 3.Metroid games and their stories unfold in a very unique and subtle manner, and this is for one key reason: Most of Samus\\' enemies have no knowledge of her language, and Metroids themselves can\\'t speak at all. However, onscreen, these creatures interact and communicate nonverbally, and their exchanges onscreen require no words to tell those who are paying attention what\\'s going on.Super Metroid had virtually no text, except at the beginning, but all of its story happens while the controller is in your hands and you\\'re manipulating Samus. It brings the concept of interactive story full-circle, and Metroid Prime introduces a whole new method of allowing that to happen. Scanning.Scanning is a brilliant and under-appreciated feature of this game. Your scan visor serves the role of Navi and Tatl from the N64 Zeldas and gives you a concise and well-written description of environmental details or the creatures and their habitat. It also clues you into puzzles and weak points on bosses. My favourite part of the Scan system however, is the Chozo Lore and Pirate Data. These two sets of narrative weave the backstory of the game, and give your actions more meaning. The beautiful touches come in the form of Chozo Lore\\'s poetic and sombre tones contrasted with the formal, technical speech of Pirate Data, which slowly turns into anti-Samus propaganda the further into Tallon IV she treks.Metroid Prime is an easy game to get into. The control scheme is perfect for the unique asymmetrical setup of the GameCube controller. I went to buy my GameCube way back in December 2002, and until that point, I hadn\\'t really figured out why Nintendo decided to abandon what I thought was a perfectly sensible set-up: the diamond pattern. Metroid Prime, within minutes of loading up, laid to rest all my doubts about the design. The game handles brilliantly, every action is the perfect distance from the main button, based on the necessity of its utility. To clarify, the jump button is right beside your thumb, and the position of the missile button in relation to the shoot button makes firing beam-missile combos a breeze. While the morph ball button only takes your hand a short distance from the combat buttons and the map button requires a conscious (read: always-intentional) button-press of the \\'Z\\' which is half trigger, half face button.Most of Samus\\' most famous latent abilities are back, including the ubiquitous Morph Ball. Which, along with some new spins on old items, takes the platforming elements of Metroid to new and extremely enjoyable heights. The combat is thrilling and engrossing, but it is most certainly not the primary gameplay element of Metroid games; Retro realized that, and made a conscious decision to /not/ make this game a First-person shooter (at the behest of Nintendo executives I\\'m almost certain). Exploration and platforming are the primary gameplay mechanics, and provide the real entertainment value in this game. The layout and interconnectedness of the world is in true Metroid fashion, and this is what makes me put the disc in my Cube again and again even though I\\'ve already completed it nearly a dozen times.The game does not have perfect visuals, there are slight flaws here and there, but you\\'ll forget the minor aliasing on the hatches after the first time you see Samus\\' reflection in her own visor. Her face is always rendered -- at different times you will see different degrees of reflection, but Samus is always blinking and looking around. The game is colourful, though not as colourful as the 2D Metroids, the architecture and environment design are great, but not all that imaginative. Metroid Prime falls short of the level of Super Metroid and the original in this regard. The majority of Tallon IV\\'s environment is stone-and-steel or organic spaces that replicate Earth to a large degree. In fact, from appearance alone; if not for the creatures, your weapons, and the fact that the statues are not of humans you would think you\\'re playing a souped-up, first-person version of Tomb Raider. The creature designs\\' whimsy, detail, and the sheer grotesqueness of the bosses are what bring the game\\'s visuals up to the level of \"superb\".On the other hand, Metroid Prime\\'s score and sound effects are unsurpassed. Great remixes of old Zebesian favourites, a few new ones, and big booming attack and damage sound effects accentuate the action extremely well, and also add a lot to the excellent atmosphere. In fact, one might argue that the aural aspects of Metroid Prime are really what hold its immersive atmosphere together.All in all, the main mission to Tallon IV in Metroid Prime is a great value, but this alone isn\\'t what makes the Metroid Prime disc worth purchasing.Metroid Prime and its portable, simultaneous-release cousin, Metroid Fusion make excellent use of GBA-GC connectivity. When you beat Metroid Prime and link up, you can unlock the Fusion Suit in full 3D, which has four variations, and appears in each cinematic of the game. Beat Metroid Fusion, and you unlock the one that started it all -- METROID, the NES classic playable on your television, each time you load Metroid Prime. No need to write down the 24-character password when you die. Your last-used password gets saved automatically onto your memory card without using an extra space. Don\\'t worry though, you can still write in your password manually if you choose -- something that should please all those creeps -- I mean fanboys -- I mean normal, upstanding individuals -- who wish to see Samus in a bathing suit in all her green-haired, 8-bit glory. But even that isn\\'t the source of Prime\\'s perfect 10 in the value category; that goes to Metroid Prime\\'s sequence-breaking, time-and-percentage record-breaking opportunities; and of course the fact that Tallon IV is the kind of planet you want to come back to over and over again.For all those who want to see just what it takes to make a great piece of interactive art, you need to check out Metroid Prime. This is the game that gave Nintendo the guts to make /Nintendo-style/ games again on the GameCube. An idea they seemed to abandon at the launch of the system',\n",

I love the way Half-Life presents its story, it's just a much more immersive world than almost anything else.I miss exploring the wide open countryside around City 17, and the game is a bit short even for only being 1/3 of a game, so it might not have been as good if it weren't for one thing - Alyx, thanks to a combination of great voice acting and the best facial animation I've ever seen in a game, is one of the most endearing and likable game characters ever.

       "  'description': \"Crysis, what is there to say about it. It is a technical achievement, amazing graphics, especially on DirectX10. Although DirectX10 has proven to be not as efficient as it was made out to be. And sadly, although the game has a great storyline, up to a certain point which will be addressed later. It falls short, it has potential and fails to meet it. It has a lot of great ideas, but in my opinion it was not implemented well. Maybe if they polished the graphics engine (Crytek 2.0) and put a solid storyline, instead of B-Rated action movies it would've or could've been so much more. Then we come to the other half of the story line, Aliens. Yes, Aliens, as if they have not plagued our hopes and dreams in movies such as Independence Day, Aliens, etc... Now we have to be forced through this, not only that, but movies that were once great, Indiana Jones, are plagued by this necessity to have some sort of sci-fi element. Crysis, has taken a page from the Farcry book, make some sort of weird creatures/aliens appear later in the game. Why? Why do you need to do this? It is so cliched right now, that everybody will hate it. Not only that, but once you reach the cold-levels of the game, the frames per second, completely crumble, even if you have the best computer in the world. On the other hand we have multiplayer. Sure you would think, this will add a lot of extended gameplay. What one might fail to realize is that the game has many bugs/glitches and graphical slow downs in multiplayer that either make everyone lag or hard to play with. If you do manage to get a good game, the system is usually broken. You start off with minimal points everytime you join a server, and you are restricted to a few weapons, the latter of the weapons are hard to get since you already need to be good at FPS's. It is a pity, because multiplayer could of really extended the gameplay you get out of Crysis, but instead falls short of broken gameplay, and laggy servers.Crysis, what could've been so much more, has fallen short. I give this game 3.5/5 stars - mainly due to the beautiful graphics, and some of the thrilling action you get to see/do during the earlier part of the game.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Excite Truck is basically a super fast truck racing game with immense jumps and speed developed by Monster Games Inc. The game is a 'sequel' to the game which debuted on the Famicom, ExciteBike.The game as it is involves you picking a truck, racing with it and trying to rack up your stars and hopefully come first in the race. You work your way through each of the cups in hope to become an ultimate truck racer - however, there is no storyline (not that a game like this particularly needs it).The aim of the races aren't really to come first - that's more of an added bonus. You really just want to get stars by doing crazy jumps, smashing up other trucks, jumping through hoops and speeding wildly through masses of trees in hope that you don't get hit and earn a star for a 'great smash'.There is also a short challenge mode with merely has six challenges in total, three different types. The first type involves you smashing other trucks in a certain time limit, which is great fun and really tense as you speed towards an enemy at full pelt, hoping you'll hit it bang on target and see it flying. Other challenges see you racing through gates or jumping through hoops.One factor that lets the game down is the trucks. There are around ten or so different trucks in total for you to pick from each with different abilities (some trucks may have better handling, for instance). However when you are actually driving the trucks or grabbing massive air, you really don't feel much of a difference between the current truck or the one before it.Another let down is the depth to the game. Although the current concept is good and a top Wii game, it could have been a whole lot more if the developer extended the ideas further and added more depth the game.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Uncharted: Drake\\'s Fortune is a third person action adventure game created by  Naughty Dog. It stars Nathan Drake, a fortune hunter, on a great mission to  discover the lost treasure of El Dorado. Plain and simple the game borrows ideas  from a variety of different sources and blends them well. Platforming and a duck  and cover system combine and give the user a fresh new experience on the PS3,  moreso if you have never been a fan of Laura Croft and have not played Gears of  War (which I am not and have not).Graphically, the game is astonishing,  even on a standard television! The vibrant jungles are fully texturized and  everything seems alive. Character\\'s expressions are fully realized, making them  seem alive as well. Shadows, vines and trees swaying, running water, even Nate\\'s  wet clothing add to a graphical experience I\\'ve never witnessed before. Naughty  Dog did a great job blending the cutscenes with gameplay and you have a  difficult time telling the difference between the two  graphically.PauseI must address the whole wet clothes issue. You  can see his clothes become wet and then once out of water, over time you can see  his clothes return to its initial dry state! I believe this is what Sony was  referring to 4D  graphics.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcc3xxvanUcBut I  digress...The sound is wonderful with top notch voice over acting.  Everything seems natural as if the actors themselves were in the game. The story  is a common treasure hunt story, but the action is fast paced and plentiful. The  only lull is during some platforming areas, but the majority of the time these  areas are mixed with other elements to keep you on your toes.The game  can be completed in just under ten hours. This includes searching (but not going  crazy) for scattered pieces of treasure. The game\\'s difficulty is not too great  as was dictated by other reviewers. If someone was turned off by the supposed  \"wave after wave\" of enemies I\\'d have to think that they weren\\'t that good at  the game to begin with...put it on easy and stop crying...but I digress yet  again.The enemy AI is very good as they will flank your position in a  convincing manner if you stay in one spot too long. They will flush you out with  grenades or send a thug armed with a shotgun in to make you take action. There  were not glitches discovered as it was clear that Naughty Dog took their time to  polish this game COMPLETELY (which is rare now-a-days) to deliver an experience  that is a definite must for ALL PS3 owners. If you own a PS3 and have not played  Uncharted...well...WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??? I guarantee...you won\\'t be  disappointed!!!Final Score: 9.3 (~4.5 stars)',\n",

       " {'deck': 'Half-Life 2: Episode Two',\n",
       "  'description': \"Half-Life 2: Episode Two  Half-Life 2: Episode Two begins immediately where the previous installment left off. Again as scientist turned-hero Gordon Freeman, you’re placed outside the realms of the obsolete City 17 with your companion Alyx Vance. The Combine Army has continued its assault of recontrolling Earth, and before long Alyx and Gordon find themselves in an ambush. When Vance is left critically wounded you’re tasked with not only saving her but taking her to The White Forest before the Combine Army reaches the rebel base.     As one of the five games in The Orange Box – Valve’s latest gaming package – Episode Two is arguably one of the most anticipated games of the year. Fans will be delighted to know that this stunning chapter of a wonderful franchise doesn’t disappoint. While the game does utilise many familiar elements of the Half-Life series like physics puzzles, weapons and enemies, the spectacular set pieces and scripted moments, ensure that Episode Two is a fresh and compelling experience.    One of the great strengths of Half-Life has been the variety of the level design and Episode Two sees players traveling from a multitude of locations outside of City 17. The underground caves at the beginning of the game are particularly notable for their intensity and claustrophobia and form a perfect contrast to the games epic scale finale in the White Forest. The latter does not offer the level of freedom for players as it may have been hyped, but the Forest is a refreshing change from the cramped metal corridors that fans of Half-Life have come to know. It is to the credit of Valves ability in design that they have crafted the exterior levels, like the White Forest and dirt tracks, in such a linear fashion without the game world ever feeling contrived or artificial.    Perhaps I was too distracted by the Source-powered visuals, which are still stunning despite the engine being several years old now. The engine has been enhanced for improved lighting and physics. As soon as you see the glow of a Vortigaunt, explore the White Forest in the new Dodge car, or watch a Strider blowing a house to smithereens, you’ll realise much the game has improved since Episode One. Yet unlike many other shooters these visuals are again a major contribution to the game’s narrative. The animations on the NPC’s are again very lifelike and add to the emotion, believability and to some degree, your attachment to the characters. The only sacrifice is slightly increased system requirements. I felt this from not meeting the proper requirements. I’m sure I would have enjoyed the game even more and had greater appreciation for the finale if I had the proper hardware to run the game.    One of the major differences that many have noted is that Alyx Vance not as prominent as she was in Episode One. The time you do spend with her is again invaluable for her assistance in combat as well as the game’s emotional front. Likewise the Vortigaunt, though not overly different from Vance, is a fairly amusing companion. His spiritual speech's and electrical strike attacks prove to be thoroughly entertaining. The real surprise however is the introduction of Dr. Magnusson, who is a nasty, cynical and quite hilarious contrast to Alyx and co. His appearances towards the end of the game should mean that he will feature more prominently in Episode Three when it is released.    On the flip side there are two new enemies introduced as well. The first is the acid Antlion Worker, which can spit toxic acid, attack with their legs and fly at the player. Found at the beginning of the game, this fierce little bugger really accentuated the depth of the combat for me. When faced against this critter I found it necessary to always duck behind cover to avoid its spray and to have to regulate to a range weapon to try and hit it. Yet it’s smart enough to fly when taking fire. This makes for a surprisingly intense firefight of timing, precision as well as selection in terms of weaponry. Quite impressive. The more hyped and touted opponent though is the Hunter. Often accompanying Striders or working in packs of three, this galloping beast uses a launcher to fire explosive darts in rapid motion, causing terrible splash damage. One of the most shocking scripted sequences, its first appearance, is particularly terrifying in demonstrating how devastating it is to unsuspecting opponent (or player as I found out myself). I saw it as a very challenging opponent, and always difficult to take down.    Perhaps the only disappointment of the episode is that it again answers so little while raising so much. It is frustrating and strangely engaging the way the game not only hints at what will be in the third installment but how it also ties itself to Portal (another game in The Orange Box)! This is perhaps an unfair criticism of the Episode Two’s story. It is the second chapter in a trilogy, and therefore must leave questions to be resolved in the third entry. The ending of the game is a powerful example of the emotion of the game and remains one of the saddest and most shocking I have seen in several years now…While a pure Half-Life game there is enough new content in Episode Two to make it a compelling experience. It is a key component to The Orange Box and I for one cannot wait to see how it all ends…\",\n",

I found about 2 to be more annoying than fun, the rest were a blast to run around, scale, and smite. But what if this was a Zelda-style action-adventure game with puzzle-filled dungeons and towns scattered around the vast countryside with people to interact with (the towns are less necessary), and the Colossus battles were the focus and the main conflict, not the entire game? The Colossi ARE awesome, but that's all there is. The environment is beautiful but really not very interesting to explore. I would truly love this game if it just felt complete. Also, I wasn't a fan of the controls, and howwhen you take damage from a strong attack, you fall over, and it takes you about ten seconds to stand up, which usually gives the enemy enough time to prepare and hit you again, repeating the process. If you can't tell from my description, this is NOT COOL. Although I really dug the connection to ICO.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Ubisoft's latest entry in the Rainbow Six franchise puts you in the shoes of team leader Logan Keller whose teammates got kidnapped on a routine mission to capture the terrorist leader Irena Morales. Logan makes it out on his own, but has to leave his mates behind on order of the headquarter. It appears that an army of terrorists has invaded Sin City and Keller is to lead Bravo team to clear the situation and uncover the plot. It's too bad though that the story sounds like taken right out of a Tom Clancy novel and is filled with clichés like terrorist securing some dangerous weapon, treachery, government secrets and what not. Add to that a lack-luster ending that leaves you hanging and too many questions unanswered and the single player can be a bit of a disappointment.  But alas, gameplay to the rescue. If there's one thing the game does extremely well, it has to be the sense of really being a squad leader who fights very intense, tactical battles against smart enemies. Key here is an elaborate cover mechanic that lets you hide behind pretty much any flat surface or small object. When taking cover, the camera will pop out of your head and switch into a 3rd person over the shoulder perspective, that lets you look around, aim at enemies and quickly jump out of your cover for a few well-placed shots before vanishing behind it again. It's a great system and necessary as well, because the A.I is pretty smart and you can only take a few hits before your vision goes black and you drop down dead if you don't recover for a few seconds.  The level design is all over the place though as some passages are very linear in an artificial way like lines of cars stacked behind each other to form barricades, while others offer a variety of options like roping through windows or multiple entrances to surprise the enemy while they are distracted by your teammates. On the other hand, the Vegas setting is for the most part really nice and certainly hasn't been done before in this fashion in any other game. Since the game relies on checkpoints to save your progress, it's note-worthy that their placement is quite fair and tries to eliminate some of the frustration that can occur during a few especially challenging sequences.  From a technical standpoint, the game is solid, falls victim to a lot of nagging flaws however. While the sound effects, especially the realistic weapon sounds as well as the voice cast, are excellent, the mixing screws up at times, making gun fights in the room next door sound like a mile off and some character voices are almost impossible to understand even if the talky heads are right next to you. Same for the graphics which are certainly solid and run at a smooth frame rate for the most part, but oddities like a few muddy textures and pop-ups like weapons disappearing and re-appearing as you move a few feet away give the game an unfinished feel. In addition, the game's 1080i support is basically busted which adds to that impression, although it runs fine in SD and 720p.  Rainbow Six: Vegas's multiplayer component is fantastic though as the game sports 2-player split screen, LAN support and online play via the PlayStation Network for up to 14 players with a total of 10 game modes on 20 maps. Modes include variations of deathmatch and team deathmatch as well as a capture the flag-like mode or escort missions where on team has to guard a VIP while the other team has to eliminate that person. As with all online play though, your mileage may vary and some players, including me, have had some issues with the game crashing at times. If you get a game going though, it's extremely fun and rewarding, as you'll gain experience, rank up and are given access to new weapons and equipment.  All in all, Rainbow Six: Vegas is a great game, especially in multiplayer, but has some issues like a few bugs and a rather disappointing story line. Still, it's easily one of the best tactical shooters to date, especially on the PS3.\",\n",

Not much - the main difference here really is the use of the remote.The object of the game is to basically work your way through a bunch of wacky mini-games using the remote in various different ways: just pointing it at the screen, holding it by your side, holding it above your head... you get the idea. You then perform these poses and complete a certain mini-game, while the game is slowly speeding up and making it trickier for you. However, the single player mode is over far to quickly (completed it in an afternoon).The multiplayer mode is basically the same, bar a few different formats of basically the same concept. This is where the game really shines as it is funny to see your friends quickly hold the remote by their side and start spinning to make a hoop spin round the person's body on-screen.The visual style of the game is really different and stands out very well. There is also a good amount of mini-games to work your way through and you don't really get tired of them - especially since they only last three seconds each anyway.With all these good points, the game is overly hyped and in my opinion it isn't all it is cracked up to be... it can also never be good that this is just another mini-game package for the Wii and just slamming loads of various Wii remote positions into one.For how it lasts, Wario Ware: Smooth Moves is a decent game and worth your money but the lack of length on the single player game is a major downside and you really wish their was a knob to rack up the difficulty.

       "  'description': \"Warhawk is a 3rd person sci-fi shooter created by SCEA Incognito. It's a  multiplayer only war game and the first on the Playstation 3. It places you on  either the red (Chernovian) or blue (Eucadian) team in an all out war that takes  place in the sky and/or on land. Due to the lack of a single player campaign  mode, one would think that this game could not be good, but one play through of  the online experience will help to convince you otherwise. You engage in the  typical multiplayer modes (i.e. Capture the Flag, Death Match, Team Death Match  and Zones) on five maps that vary in size depending on the amount of players in  the game and the mode. You can join a server and play against one person or you  can play in a 32 player mode which provide for countless hours of  entertainment.The game currently is available for either a $39.99  download from the PSN store or a $59.99 retail version that comes with an  instruction manual and Jabra blu tooth headset. The game looks great as it can  be displayed a maximum resolution of 720p and 1080i. The game's sound effects  sound great as well, however, at points during combat the soundtrack can become  repetitive. The game plays very smooth as 32 players can conduct battle in a  heavy war zone with little to no drop in frame rate.Like with most titles  that are the first in their respective franchises, there are glitches present.  These glitches are however, very difficult to find unless your sole purpose is  to discover these glitches, abuse them and ruin the online experience for  everybody else (which happens). The lack of variety during customization is a  down point as well, but does not hinder the overall great experience. Currently,  Incognito is making improvements to their servers to enhance ranking issues that  some users are having. At the moment players are ranking up without fulfilling  all the rank requirements. Although this does not seem like a huge issue, it can  be when you're playing with somebody on your team who is supposed to be a few  ranks above you and in actuality is a few notches below you. Critical battles  can be lost in this manner and ultimately ruin your overall record in the game.  Sometimes network traffic in the game can be tough to deal with as most games do  not display the correct amount of people in a game. For example a Team Death  Match game may say it has 18 of 24 people playing but will be full and will not  allow you to enter the game.Other than those few issues, the game makes  for a very solid experience. As stated previously, there are only five maps that  are currently available for the game, but something tells me (hoping) that the  future will yield a handful of additional maps as well as some sort of campaign  mode. There is tons of replay value with Warhawk due to the amount of variety  that online multiplayer games provide in conjunction with the need to constantly  rank up and receive achievements (if you're into those things). If you own a  Playstaion 3, I definitely recommend this game as you will have one of the  better online experiences (if not the best) provided by the PS3 with this one. \",\n",

But I really can't see how it deserves PS2 Game of the Year over Shadow of the Colossus, Resident Evil 4 and Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones. Or in the case of awards givers who cut off holiday games until the next year, how it's better than Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal. Anyway, God of War is a fun game. The combat is very fluid and rewarding, as you progress and become more powerful as the game goes on. There's fairly good enemy variety, although I wish we could have seen a few more centaurs and sirens instead of an overdose of undead soldiers and harpies, and that the Cerberus were just there instead of starting as annoying little shits that spawn like popcorn.The combat isn't why I like it though, what I really like are the adventure elements and the story. Although it seemed a bit long, the Temple of Pandora was a brilliantly designed area, and really pulled off the feel of an epic, hazardous dungeon. And the cutscenes were more interesting than I expected, by the end I understood Kratos a bit more and wanted to help him kill Ares. The animation on Kratos' double jump is pathetic, but the platforming is fairly enjoyable for a non-platforming game. What really hurt the game was the design on the whole end of it, starting in Hades. They were just lazy (or short on time) here, instead of making what could have been a really cool area, they just threw a bunch of enemies on steroids and idiotic spinning spike hazards at you, and it really isn't fun or interesting. We're nearing the climax, I'm not supposed to be getting bored. After that you fight Ares, and the whole sequence with him is no good either. After the creativity of the first two boss fights, Ares is just a cheap bastard who blocks all of your attacks and winning the final conflict is more about luck than skill. The only redeeming part about the end is how they tied off the end with the gravedigger. So, overall, a fun game, but it's lacking in ways that make it hard to call truly great.\",\n",

We are now up to Hit and Run in \\'03 and perhaps this is one of the best Simpsons games to date?At the start of the game you find out that the town is infested by mechanical bees, black vans and Buzz cola. Weird? You bet, but it is just a storyline like this that really makes you believe you are playing a Simpsons game. In the game you can play as either Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Apu (you can also become other people such as Skinner in missions, but this is only while driving).The idea of the game is to follow the story by completing tasks or missions, sometimes for other people around the town. While you are at this you can roam Springfield collecting coins which you can spend on new cars or buy funny outfits for your character. You can also collect all the cards around the town to unlock a funny Itchy and Scratchy animation from Comic Book Guy\\'s store - this really does add extra hours onto the game if you want to get 100%.The game is also split into \\'levels\\', each level representing a different character and a different part of the town. You usually move onto the next character when a big change has happened within the storyline. With the new characters comes new missions and cars.Hit and Run has the real voice actors reprising their role in the game, so you won’t hear some random man shouting \"D\\'oh!\", but you will instead get the real deal - this of course adds to the comedy moments with some great lines from the characters.The graphics are all in 3D and they pull off the town and show\\'s atmosphere perfectly.

       "  'description': \"Disgaea: Hour of Darkness is a very unique strategy rpg. The story follow a young demon boys adventures after he wakes from a 2 year slumber. He then discovers that his father died during his deep sleep, but being a demon, he doesn't care. All that Laharl cares about is becoming a Overlord and taking down anyone in his way. Laharl is joined by a large cast of characters on his road to Overlord, such as Etna, A demon girl whos memory has been taken from her, Flonne, an angel send to asssinate Laharls late father, only to discovery hes dead, but instead decides to teach laharl the ways of love, and Exploding penguins with the souls of convicts called prinnys.Battle is handled much like the very popular game Final Fantasy Tactics or Advanced Wars. All characters start from a home node at the beginning of the game and can be withdrawn and summoned at anytime from this home node. Characters move on a grid, and can move a set distance per turn. A intresting thing about Disgaeas combat is that turns aren't determined by speed but rather by sides. Your side, meaning all your characters summoned, will go first and be able to attack and move then once you end your turn your opponent goes, much like chess.\\xa0 This along with the ability to excute moves without actually ending your turn leads to some intresting things. You can surround a enemy with characters have them attack one by one and then excute the moves one after another building up a combo, building in damage as the combo becomes higher. this along with Team attacks, magic spells and visually stunning special moves keep the combat freah.Another unique thing about disgaea is the equipment system. All characters have 4 slots to equip weapons, armor, and items. Theres no limit to the actual items you equip except for only one weapon is allowed at a time, but if you want to equip 3 pairs of boots just for the speed and movement bonus you can. Equipment and items are bought in your main hub, which allows you to access new stages and create new characters.The length of this game is much shorter then your average rpg, but lenghted do to the ability to play the game over with all your equipment with new game plus, make the enemys higher level for more challenge and level to level 9999, which will take awihleI didn't even cover half of things in this huge game. This is game will make you wanna keep coming back to it to get more and more powerful. The difficulty can be up and down sometimes and at first the 2d sprites on 3d backgrounds is off putting, but this games quirky characters and replay value are Definitaly worth a purchase.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Lost is the first and only TV show that I currently faithfully follow. I love it. I read about it. I\\'m interested in anything to do with it.  As such, I was skeptical about that game from the start, as any gamer would be of any kind of movie/TV show that is shoehorned into a videogame. I didn\\'t buy it on release, but after reading up on some reviews, I decided to rent it. This was a very good move, and if you are considering playing this game, before you read any further please note that I strongly encourage you to rent this game. You will beat it easily during that rental time, save yourself over $30, and you can beat the entire game to 100% completion in that time frame to boot.  Now onto the actual review. The main character of this game is Elliot Maslow. You control him throughout the game from a third-person perspective. Within the game, he is a photojournalist on flight 815 (this character was created solely for this game and does not appear in the show) who crash-lands on an island alongside the Lost characters from the show. He gets amnesia from the impact, and the whole rest of the game is hinged upon recovering his memory. This is done in a very linear fashion, as the game is split up into \"episodes,\" with a flashback taking place at the beginning of each episode. In this flashback, you use your trusty camera to photograph a special detail/event that takes place within the flashback in order to advance to a cutscene which advances you in your quest to learn about your past. If you miss the detail/event when it happens, the flashback simply loops until you figure out what to do, which makes everything run a whole lot smoother.  The flashback segments are interesting and fun the first few times, but since you can predict it happening very close to the beginning of each level, it gets to be very repetitive. After you take the photo, you are allowed to roam in the environment that your flashback encompasses, looking for three special \"hidden\" items each time, usually the same things over and over again. They\\'re easy to find. This is a good concept but poorly executed. Mostly, it contains little easter eggs for fans of Lost with mentions of such things as the Hanso Foundation.  As a side note, at the beginning of each level/episode is a cutscene that details what happened previously-where you left off on the previous level. Some people have complained about this feature, but I actually enjoyed it because it is very reminiscent of the show. Overall, it\\'s not a big deal.  If you are a fan of the show like me, you may have been looking forward to interacting with the characters from the show. The characters hang out on the beach for the most part, waiting for you to come talk to them. As I was playing, I was trying to figure out how the heck the developers intended for anyone but a Lost fan to play this game, because there really is nothing to help you understand the plot of the show. The problem is they just don\\'t have much to say. What\\'s more, very few characters in the game have the voices of their real life counterparts. I laughed a lot because of this. Especially Sawyer\\'s voice actor. I know they try so hard, but it just doesn\\'t work. The music in the game, however, is noticeably better than the voice acting. It just makes everything feel like Lost. If you appreciate the music from the show, you will appreciate it here.  As far as gameplay is concerned, there just isn\\'t much. What\\'s there would be all good fun if there was variety, but everything that acts as a novelty early on is rehashed until you can\\'t wait until you are finished. You\\'ll do a lot more running from the Smoke Monster than you might expect. I had imagined some epic chase scenes where I\\'m running through the forest at a blistering pace, dodging trees and bushes and such with the Smoke Monster hot on my heels and ripping up trees along the way. But it was completely dumbed down to \"hiding in bamboo.\" You go from bamboo patch to bamboo patch, with the Monster seeming to be hunting you down. There is no reprieve. It\\'s just waiting for you. All the freaking time. It\\'s annoying. You progress little by little, looking for markers to guide you to the next bamboo section. There is no epicness whatsoever.  There is another segment that is frequently repeated where you have to travel through caves, apparently because this character is too cool to climb over things like the people in Lost the TV show do. This part of the game is far more frustrating than the Smoke Monster segments. It\\'s pitch black in the caves, and you start with just a lighter. Then you can buy (via trading items such as coconuts. Yea. I was thinking the exact thing you are now), torches, and eventually a lantern, each of which have a time limit on how long you can use them before they need refueling. You have to avoid pits in the ground, tediously put out your torch at the sound of bats so they don\\'t damage it, and of course put it out for waterfalls you have to walk under, relighting it afterward in a longish animation. And if you decide to sit in the dark, just for kicks and giggles, apparently the Smoke Monster is in the cave with you waiting to rip you to shreds in the first 30 seconds of darkness. Yea, I did it just to see what would happen. It wasn\\'t even close to satisfying. It\\'s just pitch dark, the controller starts to vibrate like a heart beat, and then the game notifies you with text that you died. Woohoo. The caves were the worst part of the whole game. A small one would have been fun once. But they are long, tedious, and frequent. Locke sends you into one to go soul searching. All he had to do was go in a tent and sit down (in the TV show), but yet he makes you traverse a pit-riddled cave without even giving you a flashlight.  The highlight of the whole game is, unfortunately, the graphics. I know it\\'s cliche, but it\\'s true. The jungle and beach and wreckage all look wonderful. And the character models, while they by no means stack up to the likes of Crysis, are much better than they could be. I don\\'t really expect anything less than this from Ubisoft, which in my mind simply doesn\\'t release ugly games. I thought it was a beautiful game. Not nearly as detailed as you might hope (wandering through the jungle is not fun, it just feels like wandering around in someone\\'s backyard that happens to strongly resemble a jungle, then you run into their fence which happens to be an invisible border inside the game telling you that you have to turn back, or else), but beautiful in the grand scope of things.  The plot is good, especially so at the ending. It\\'s one of those \"What the crap?!?\" endings. So if you like those, then you\\'ll like this. I still don\\'t know what happened in the story. One main issue with the game is that everything major in the show is trivialized. The loss of your memory seems of greater importance than the button in the hatch that must be pushed every 108 minutes. Imagine that. On a side note, I\\'m not sure why they included Michael in the game when there are other, better characters that didn\\'t make it into the game. All he ever does is scream for Walt. Yes, even in the videogame. It makes me cringe. Also, the fact that the game portrays the Others as sitting up in trees, waiting for the Losties to wander through the jungle so they can shoot from their perches pisses me off. This is nothing like the show, and a feeble attempt to spice up the game. They are neither cool nor mysterious.  Basically, just rent it for the gamer points. You will be hard pressed to make it through this game in a reasonable amount of time without a guide. I recommend gamefaqs.com or if you have real trouble, Youtube for the caves. It\\'s an easy 1000 points. You can get them all in a rental though. However hardcore you think you are as a fan of Lost, nothing warrants buying this game as there is absolutely no replay value. Also of note, I played this game thinking I would learn some cool stuff about the show, but then I found out that none of it can actually be counted as part of the real Lost TV story. It\\'s all just fanfiction, essentially.   All of this is very unfortunate. Sorry.',\n",

       "  'description': \"The Simpsons Wrestling was released for the Playstation back in 2001. The story basically goes that Kang and Kodos have challenge the citizens of Springfield to a wrestling match, but only one person will go against them. The town have a wrestling tournament to decide who that strong person should be.Each character (sixteen in total, each voiced by the real actor) has four moves excluding jumping. When the wrestler performs special moves their energy bar drops and then slowly refills over time when they are not attacking someone. The amount of energy that gets used up depends on what move is used. A downside in the wrestling is that some characters can win any match by repeatedly using the same move over and over that requires hardly any energy.To become invincible your character will have to collect letters that float around the ring which will then allow you to beat the living daylights out of your opponent with no worries of having the same thing happening to you. The same rules apply as they do in wrestling - a match ends when someone gets pinned onto the floor to the count of three.Although it sounds pretty good so far, the graphics aren't the best thing in the world. It may have the excuse of matching the style of the show, but it doesn't even do that. The wrestling is actually very repetitive and the game has nothing special in it that makes it stand out.This is one of those Simpsons games that you can just look over. If you are a big Simpsons fan you may get a kick out of the quotes and seeing your favourite characters wrestling, but it will soon get repetitive and boring.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Perfect Dark Zero has been labeled as the \"Love it or Hate it\" game of the Xbox 360. However, many of the \"hate it\\'s\" have been derived from gamers who have made inaccurate comparisons to other games and also from gamers unable to adapt to the game play and tendencies of the game. While not perfect, PDZ is a game that every Xbox 360 owner should play, if not own.  The story, while not entirely strong, does give you a reason to keep moving forward. It doesn\\'t always make sense, but it does provide the player with more story and character to that story than most games these days. It\\'s nothing to write home about, but it serves its purpose.  The most important thing though is that the action in this game is top notch. The new cover and roll systems work great, and are purposeful enough that they don\\'t become gimmicks. The weapons all feel great and differ just enough that its easy to recommend different weapons for different situations. For example. the P9P is a great pistol with a scope and decent power, but its small clip won\\'t do you much in a close fight, for that you will probably need the Ak47 equivalent, which features more bullets but no scope.  The graphics are great. There are a few inconsistencies, but overall you can tell this game was made for the Xbox 360. The graphics style can be described as \"stylized realism\" with players looking slightly exaggerated but you can tell that they are based on real life counterparts of people. The only way I feel you can discount these graphics is if you ONLY care about ultra-realistic graphics, and to that I say, go look at real photographs, because apparently thats what you want. This is a video game, not a movie or photo album.  In the end, this is a must have game for the Xbox360. The single player is fun, the multiplayer is addictive, and it has lasted me for months of play and still is being played in my Xbox360.',\n",

       "  'description': \"HAZE- PS3Reviews lately seem to be taking the easy way out and comparing everything to COD4. “Army of Two’s online isn’t as good as Call of Duty”, or “Everybody’s Golf World Tour is decent, but there’s no martyrdom”. But I’m going to review HAZE for what it is: The latest FPS from Free Radical Design.You’ve probably heard already that HAZE is all based around Nectar, a performance enhancing drug that has its downsides. You take the role of Shane Carpenter, a character you you’ll probably grow to hate. He is very easily lead, and changes his opinion just because people tell him to, not the kind of person you want to play as in a run’n’gun FPS. You’ll spend your first two hours playing as a Mantel trooper, get hit in the face and quickly switch sides to rebel without putting much thought into it. The opening mantel levels are uninspiring due to atrocious level design. When I finally started getting into a fire fight, it was over in an instance, followed by sluggish uneventful walking to the next one. This is my main gripe with the game. It’s inconsistent. It feels like the levels where designed by a 15 year old and haven’t been thought out correctly. However, the fire fights themselves can be quite enjoyable. Spraying glowing yellow Mexicans from across the room with a fully automatic gun brings a smile to your face. What this section is missing is good old iron sights. There are times when enemies are too far away to hip fire, but to close to use the nectar scope, and I found myself getting very frustrated trying to hit them. The fun kicks in when you make the inevitable switch to the rebel side. Here you get to make use of several new features, including nectar grenades, weapon stealing and play dead. All of these come in handy regularly and add a nice variation to the game. The feeling of punching a storming mantel trooper in the face, grabbing his gun and annihilating him with his own gun is hard to beat, and watching mantel troopers freak out after getting nectar bombed is hilarious. Two abilities seem a little throw in though. The “booby trap” concept involves facing the ground and burying a grenade, which a lot of the time doesn’t make sense, as I wondered how wuss like Carpenter could dig a hole in solid concrete. Although this feature sounds cool in theory, I didn’t get to use this once throughout the entire game. Also just feel I should mention that the vehicle sections throughout aren’t really enjoyable. They’re all difficult to control, and can’t take much damage. Maybe I should have mentioned it earlier, but you DO NOT want to play this in hard difficulty. The Mantel levels are a breeze thanks to nectar, but the difficulty suddenly spikes when you switch to rebels. One instance in particular led to severe cursing at the TV. You are stuck in a small room and have to guard a hacker while he tries to overload the servers of the system. Troopers rappel in from random corners of the room, and progressively start swarming in quicker. But oh no, these aren’t your regular troopers, these bastards aren’t affected by nectar grenades, and take a whole clip to drop them. I played this for well over an hour with three other guys helping me online.The story itself probably looked great to FR on paper, but their execution of it is what held it back. It focuses on the lies behind the Mantel organisation and the mysterious nectar drug. It attempts to be quite dark at times, but the cartoonish graphics and mediocre voice acting prevent you from taking the game seriously. That brings me to my next point- voice acting. FR obviously tried to create a sense of immersion in the battles, as AI team mates shout words of encouragement. This is all fine and well for the first few levels with each side, but after hearing “Remember your promise to Merino!” for the fiftieth time, you can imagine that it gets on the irritating side. The rest of the sound effects are solid however, as gun battles are tense with the sound of assault rifles blazing coupled with rumble from the Dual Shock 3.Graphics seem to be the thing most people complained about in HAZE. The player models are quite impressive though, along with the visual effects of nectar injection and overdosing. However, the environment textures leave a lot to be desired. While I’m far from a graphics whore, at some stages the poor graphics detracted from the immersion. I’m going to use an example from a cutscene. You watch a mantel trooper going insane whilst talking to himself, ending with him blowing his own brains out in front of his friend who then does the same thing. While this does sound like a dark and dramatic cutscene, any emotions created are immediately destroyed by the ridiculously bad blood effects. I’m talking MS Paint style bad. Another thing to note is how unrealistic vehicle explosions are. They go on fire first, briefly explode and then magically tires go flying in all directions but the chassis is nowhere to be seen.I also experienced a pretty serious glitch when playing too. I was speeding through a vehicle level, and swerved to avoid an enemy drop ship, only to be sucked underground and left to fall endlessly through space. I had no option but to kill myself and try again. To my anger the exact same thing happened twice in a row. This makes me wonder how Free Radical couldn’t have came across this during those six or seven months they delayed this game.HAZE does however slightly redeem itself by offering split screen co-op with the ability for you and your buddy to play online with several others. This lent itself nicely to those controller-through-the-wall moments on hard difficulty. Not much else to mention about co-op except that it’s fixed vertical split and the rest is exactly the same as single player. I didn’t get much of a chance to get to grips with the multiplayer but I did have time to note a few things. Split screen multiplayer option is nice, especially fun to be on opposing sides. Death match and team death match get old quick, and don’t offer much variety as there is only a handful of maps. Team Assault mode however is very interesting. This game mode gives each team objectives to complete in order to gain win, and the objectives are different for every map. For mantel it usually involves simply preventing the rebels from doing something. For the rebels it’s a little more complicated. One map in particular I enjoyed was entitles “P.O.W” (Prisoner of War). In this mode, the rebel team are being held in a circular prison, and have to escape handcuffed while being hounded by troopers. I had twenty minutes of solid fun with this game mode, which can't be said for many games.Multiplayer aside, HAZE’s relatively short campaign doesn’t offer much replayability, although the inclusion of split screen online co-op does spice things up a little, even diehard fans will only play through it twice at max because of having to endure the slower sections. Core game play elements are solid and nectar proves to be more than just a gimmick. On the negative side, lacklustre graphics and bad level design mean for an inconsistent game. I personally am on the fence about this one, as there were times I was on the edge of my seat, and other times I was bored to tears. Friends looking for a fun split screen game should have a blast, but long time FPS fans will find it hard to justify a purchase.

The age you want your age to be at is 20 according to the game and to see whether or not you are a genius you will be asked to play a selection of random games to determine what your brain age is.The DS is turned on its side much like a book and has you writing your answers on the touch screen, tapping the correct answers or speaking into the microphone. The games consist of a variety of things. One game titled Calculations x20 (in which you can unlock other, harder versions) sees you quickly answering mathematical questions as quickly as possible. Other games are - but not limited to - things such as keeping track of how many people stay in the house, saying aloud the colour of the word and not the actual word (for example, the word could be coloured red but the actual written word could be green), tapping numbers from highest to lowest and memorising words (easily the most boring game). After this the game then calculates your brain age.There is also multiplayer (not Wi-Fi, though) mode which let you play the calculation game against up to 15 other players solely using your cartridge. There is also a side game of Sudoku which has a large amount of puzzles to complete. The Sudoku is actually set out very nicely and uses the touch screen to its full use.The downside of this game is that of the speech and writing recognition. You may write your 9s differently to how the game wants you to write it or you may quickly scribble down an answer and have the game drop marks for thinking you wrote the wrong answer. The speech recognition is also poor in some places as when you clearly say the correct answer it'll tell you you're wrong, making you waste time having to repeat yourself.A small downside is the fact this game is quite serious and you won’t particularly find any humour in here (except Dr Kawashima's quite frankly awful jokes) and if you are looking for a similar, fun but more light-hearted game, you'd be better off with Big Brain Academy. Overall, a solid low budget game. \",\n",

But I tried Guitar Hero and decided to pick it up, because unlike DDR and its ilk, I find it fun as hell. In most rhythm games, you're just timing button presses (or footsteps) to some music and getting points. I don't find it very compelling. But in Guitar Hero, you're not playing along, you're actually creating the music yourself. If you mess up a part, you don't just lose points and get closer to failing, the guitar part drops out. When you get it right, it's like you're actually playing these famous riffs yourself, and that makes all the difference. The controls take a bit of getting used to, but before long you'll be rocking out harder than you thought you could. In just a week I've gone from bad to capable of doing well on the hard difficulty. The more complex the tune, the more satisfying it is when you execute it perfectly. It's also a ton of fun with friends. Check it out if you like fun.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Grand Theft Auto IV is not inherently challenging or difficult. It is not inherently unique, nor does it do much to differ from its predecessors. But it does manage to do everything that it sets out to do, rarely falling below the mark. What it lacks in originality, it makes up for in variety. But most of all, it manages to be fun. A lot of fun.  As I began the game and progressed through it, I felt the grip of the main character, Niko Bellic, continually tightening around me. Everyone has praised him up and down as being so intensely likable, and I\\'m proud to say that he is. He is a compelling character who, through controlling him during the course of the game, you can\\'t help but become attached to. At his roots, Niko is just another guy who wants to live a normal life, not having to worry about anything. But those he is surrounded by are constantly dragging him down, back into the firefight-engulfed streets.   Which brings me to the rest of the \"cast.\" Rockstar has crafted some truly amazing and original characters. The voice acting is superb, and the dialogue is entirely entertaining. I won\\'t go into the characters in detail, but the people with which Niko interacts manage to help make the game what it is without stealing the spotlight from him. One or two may get on your nerves, but those same characters may be another person\\'s favorite. Basically, there is something for everyone in this regard.  These same characters will have you going on side missions for them and even going on \"dates,\" so to speak. In the game, you are provided with a virtual cell phone with which you can call up people you\\'ve come in contact with. You can ask your friends to go bowling, throw some darts, hit up a strip club, or go get drunk, among other things. And the best part is that there is no catch. You actually go bowling and play darts and pool and get drunk yourself. Getting drunk was perhaps my favorite thing to do when interacting with the other characters. The reason for this is the amazing rag doll physics, which I am a sucker for. You stumble and fall on things/people, and move \"realistically.\" The same applies when you get hit by a car, or exploded (yes I said \"exploded.\")  The main plot is merely ok. It\\'s got a twist or two, sure. But it\\'s nothing you\\'d enjoy seeing in a movie theater. The reason I loved the plot is the dialogue. It\\'s great and flows very smoothly. What trumps this, in my opinion, is the engrossing world in which you play. The ambulance picks up injured people. The police really arrest crooks on the street and, after chasing them down, cuff them and put them in the back of the patrol car. The firefighters actually can be seen going to work in the morning at the station. All of it comes off as very \"real,\" and it\\'s a great feeling.  As for gameplay, the main story arc is fairly repetitive. It gets to the point that you realize it isn\\'t \"if\" but \"when\" the crap is gonna hit the fan. So-and-so sent you to protect someone? Well expect a hit squad to try and mess you up. Someone sent you to deliver some drugs? Oh, well, surprise! There are some more dudes you have to cap. It\\'s a good thing Grand Theft Auto IV\\'s gunplay is very polished. While it is by no means deep, it works, and it works well. You can hide behind cover, pop out and shoot, and return to cover a la Gears of War.   There is an auto-aim system in place that is accessed by holding down the aiming trigger completely, but free-aim is utilized by only halfway depressing the trigger. It\\'s very easy to use. This comprises the majority of the \"campaign.\" The good thing about the story missions is that the folks at Rockstar manage to keep the ways in which you kill people very diverse and very entertaining (sadistic, I know). It never really gets stale. Just when I felt like I was going through the motions, something new was tossed my way and got me right back into the action.  The main story can be beaten in less than 30 hours (I think I completed it in around 25 hours). Of course, it doesn\\'t stop there. Plenty of other activities litter the streets of Liberty City. You can participate in street races, steal cars for a couple of your contacts to earn money, deliver drugs, assassinate people, and chase down crooks. You know, just your average run-of-the-mill activities (note: sarcasm). But more than that, you can go on the previously mentioned \"dates\" with friends, even going so far as logging on to a virtual \"internet\" of sorts that exists only within the game. This allows you to find singles to date and fake websites to read, all of which are hilarious and well worth your time. You can go to a comedy club or spend your time watching fake TV shows in your apartment, or even playing a made-up arcade game called \"QUB3D.\"  Essentially, there is a good deal of things to do to keep you busy. I was entirely overwhelmed when I first started. There are many, many things in this game, and the graphics engine does an impressive job of rendering it all. The graphics in this game are nice. They aren\\'t awesome, but they are nice. I have no complains as far as this topic goes; they get the job done. Sometimes things might look a little clunky, and sometimes they take a little too long to render. This last part is only a complaint when you are driving too fast and something appears right in front of you. It is incredibly annoying.  The sound in this game is very remarkable as well. There are a number of radio stations to choose from while driving. Though there aren\\'t a whole lot of tracks on each station, the fact that, as a whole, there is so much music is a welcome feature in the game. Hard rock, the classics, alternative, jazz, take your pick. They\\'re all here. The sound effects themselves are not wholly outstanding but there isn\\'t anything that is to be desired.  Now here go my complaints (and where things turn cynical). Your friends within the game can get annoying. They incessantly call you because they are apparently extremely lonely without you. They always want to do stuff with you, and if you say no, then you lose \"reputation\" with them. Luckily there is a way around losing your rep (say yes then cancel plans), but I still started loathing answering the phone. Another annoying thing is getting hit by a car. If said car just so happens to run over you and stop on top of you, you die instantly. If anything stays on top of you, you die instantly. This is widely regarded as a very bad thing. It happens at very inopportune times and it sucks. Also, sometimes the AI gets stupid. This only happened to me two or three times though, so it\\'s not too big of a deal when they decide to run out and get killed. Also, it\\'s beastly hard to drive vehicles. I got used to it, but it\\'s still daunting.  Here is a sort-of short description of multiplayer: You join a game. There are a ton of gametypes. You hope the gametype that you feel like playing is \"race\" or \"deathmatch\" or some deathmatch variant, because if it is \"Team Carjack City,\" no one else will play with you. You get in said game and have a lot of fun, but all these noobs are wailing and hollering because the host had auto-aim turned on. You suffer these peoples\\' annoying voices, and play what is a pretty fun multiplayer game. It has no depth, but it\\'s fun. It\\'s especially fun with friends, so if you have any, tell them to play with you. Picture four of you in a single car, arms all out the windows, doing drive-bys. It\\'s extremely fun. But when someone makes you explode, it sucks. And there you have it.  Grand Theft Auto IV is not a great game because of any one aspect. If anything, it would be due to the variety of things you\\'ll find yourself doing and enjoying as a whole. You can do whatever you want, whenever you want, and have fun doing it. If you want to watch fake TV in the game, you\\'ll have fun doing it. If you want to try outrunning the cops on a 6-star rating (which was not discussed in this review), you\\'ll have a grand ole time. The game is a great game, and while there isn\\'t a whole lot of replay value, I\\'ve already logged in something like 65 hours into the game. That\\'s a lot more than any other game I own. It\\'s not perfect by any means, but it is great. I\\'ll be holding onto it for a while, that much is certain.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Metroid Fusion was the first 2D entry in the series since Super Metroid, and because of that fact alone, the game had big shoes to fill, even on a weaker platform like the GBA. Metroid Fusion largely does not disappoint, with much of the requisite Metroid elements present and accounted for. Despite the hand-holding of Samus\\' new ship\\'s computer, Metroid Fusion still manages to offer all the challenging exploration, memorable bosses, and engaging puzzle-solving Metroid fans expect. The game\\'s prefab backgrounds and sprites are also quite visually appealing and varied. Fusion\\'s music is passable, but the sound effects offer little improvement over Metroid II on the original GameBoy from over a decade ago. In the end, the challenge it offers, and the intriguing new directions taken by the game\\'s plot will offer plenty of entertainment for Metroid fans.Metroid Fusion plays like every other 2D Metroid: You can shoot, you can jump, and eventually you can roll into a morph ball and drop bombs, but there is something different about this game: as mentioned earlier, it is written into Metroid Fusion\\'s story that Samus had no choice but to accept the assistance of a sentient computer in order to undertake her mission at the Federation\\'s Biologic Space Laboratory, and this factor takes away the feeling of loneliness for which the Metroid series has come to be renowned. However, in plot terms, Samus\\' relationship with the computer is dynamic, and in gameplay terms keeps the pace accelerated. It does not take away the exploring elements, as you can return to any area you visit to try and find weapon upgrades and new paths The gameplay is also conducive to a wide variety of puzzles that test your lateral thinking skills. The bosses are also quite excellent, offering varied -- and genuine -- challenges from start to finish. None of the bosses are too easy, and some of them are downright menacing. Some players will get frustrated, but cheap bosses these are not, and they all have weaknesses to exploit.The game also exemplifies the GBA\\'s power admirably, with nicely detailed sprites and rich environments -- which is surprising, considering the game takes place entirely in a space station. With the presence of the X virus, creatures will transform and evolve before your eyes, and the sheer number, variety, and detail of these enemy sprites is very impressive. The creatures in the game can be found mostly in Metroid II and Super Metroid, but there is a considerable variety of new creatures, and all but 2 of the bosses are entirely new also.The game\\'s sound can be described as \"competent\" at best. While the music conveys the proper amount of tension that given situations call for, most of the sound effects are not all that impressive. Granted, there are voices (that is to say, one voice) in the game, but it is quite muffled (though still audible) and used sparingly. The audio does its job, no more, no less.Metroid Fusion is a game that will keep enthusiasts coming back: with speed runs, minor sequence breaking, and low-percent challenges, there are many ways to play through Metroid Fusion, and it is unlikely you will get 100% on the first try. Though the game can be beaten in a few days by first-time players, Metroid Fusion does indeed have long-term value because of the aforementioned reasons.The X virus are an intriguing new addition to the Metroid canon. The story that Samus tells us as we control her is more engrossing than any Metroid game before or since, and the way it is told will keep many players looking forward to the next elevator sequence. The events in the game flow logically from the endings of Metroid II and Super Metroid, and hearing Samus reflect on her own power and accompanying responsibility is quite compelling.Metroid Fusion is a must for any Metroid fan, and comes highly reccomended to anyone with a GBA or DS looking for a challenging, engrossing, experience.',\n",

       "  'description': \"The Good Stuff: - A nice update of a classic RTS. - Large tank battles can be fun. The Bad Stuff: - Dated graphics with little animation. - Unfair and unforgiving AI. - Little in the way of stragety. - Little depth in gameplay. - Very bland, borring and dull maps.  Back in 1992, Dune II revolutionized stragety games forever. One of the first real time strategies, it allowed you to select multiple units and attack with the click of a button. You would build buildings and place them within the radius of your base, and harvest spice to gain money and build an large force to eliminate the opponent. Since then, there have been many great games expanding on this formula such as Command and Conquer, Warcraft, Starcraft and the most innovative real time stragety yet Total Annihilation. It has been over eight years before a sequel to the hit classic has been made, but was it worthwhile?   Westwood has more of less made the same game, but with improved graphics and AI. The graphics are certainly a big improvement, but are pretty weak by todays standards. All the maps in the game look identical, with a different layout. There is a large quantity of maps, but thats probably because all the developers needed to do was lay down a bunch of orange rock all over the place with sand and spice mixed in-between. The levels are very uninteresting and are lacking in any sense of atmosphere. The level design is generally poor and careless. You will be mostly wondering flat orange and white lands with hardly anything to affect your stragety on the map, other than to rush into the enemy's base. There are the few cliffs that make you a tad higher, but are generally randomly scattered around the place. Each map might aswell of been made with a random map generator, because that's how uninspired the maps are.  Maps aside, the game looks pretty decent. The buildings look sharp with alot of detail in them, tough they are mostly static. Each vehicle is distinguishable, but lack depth as most vehicle look like they are the same height as each other. Some vehicles don't appear to have any turrets or source for weaponry, which makes it look like rockets and shells are popping up mysteriously above the vehicle. Aside from the eight directional movement, vehicles remain unanimated and nothing more than static moving boxes on wheels. Most of the games affects are weak aswell, which makes for unspectacular battles - save for a few explosions from airstrikes and buildings getting destroyed.  If your looking for a really exciting, and innovative stragety game, then Dune 2000 will not cut the cake for you. Dune 2000 is essentially Dune II, this includes the same houses with the same units and buildings. The only real differences between the factions is slightly different building skins and a few unique units. The factions share many of the same units and buildings which leads to stale and predictable action. There isn't much stragety to the game other than to build as many units as possible and charge at your enemy. Once you get to the heavier tanks, just keep on spamming because they're not too expensive and can easily run over infantry since they all stand closely together packed in squads of five. Aircraft is almost non existent in the game, apart from an airstrike support power and carryalls which can move your units around the battlefield and bring in reinforcements. Engineers are almost pointless, since most buildings can be destroyed in seconds. Your engineers cost up to eight times more than basic infantry units and even cost more than some buildings. However, when up against the computer, they like to send in an engineer or two with every attack squad and take over your entire base.  The AI is unforgiving in this game, even when using the easy difficultly, the AI can build units much faster than you can. This is probably due to the fact that for some strange reason, you cannot queue units. Instead, if you want an army of light infantry, you got to keep clicking the button whilst managing your buildings and tanks. You also have to take into account you have to place building on concrete, otherwise they loose health over time. This takes more time to build an additional building, find an place you can build the concrete and then build the building you want. Should one square of the building be off the concrete however, and that building will loose health. It would also be much easier if your build radius wasn't very limited, coupled with the fact you have very limited build space since you can't build on sand and it becomes a big annoyance.   Facing off against one AI opponent isn't too much of a problem, but more than one and it becomes a frustrating nightmare. You will be getting waves from each AI opponent every opportunity they have, and you will have engineers all over you along with their force to cruse your own units. Because of the hassle it is to build buildings, it can take a long time to get base defenses, especially considering you need to keep building power plants... er I mean wind traps (And the fact there is enough wind on a completely deserted planet to power all thoose refineries and vehicle factories is ludicrous). Infantry is pretty useless. Although very cheap, they do little damage and have a very short range and are easily crushed by the huge number of tanks you will likely be facing. Should you try and attack the AI, they will most likely pummel your attack force with a ready force of their own, all of course whilst pumping out units the moment they are available.  There are so many features missing in Dune 2000 found in a typical RTS, despite the fact Westwood themselves have incorporated such features in the past. There is no garrisoning units of any means, not even APC's. There are no hotkeys to speak off, so everything must be done by hand. Because their are no way-points, you have to micro-manage every single aspect of your units to make sure they don't suddenly stop in the middle of an army doing nothing but getting obliterated. Infact, you can't choose any stances for your units other than guard mode, which selected units will all attack a threat within line of site, instead of them all sitting there only attacking when enemy is within firing radius. There is one support power for each faction, but all of which barely reduce a building to half it's health which makes using them almost pointless.  The sound in the game is hardly anything remarkable either. Each automatic weapon uses similiar washed out beats and rockets sound very unbelievable; it sounds like you dropped a tin cased selection box. The music tries to mimic that of in the film, but uses similiar tones around a narrow pitch that hardly raises the mood in atmosphere in anyway, other than to remind you that you are indeed on the most deserted planet that could ever be found in a video game. The game even rips a monster sound from the game Doom used for the worm, which was made seven years earlier. Does Westwood not think that sound technology may of advanced onwards from then?  If you were a fan of Dune II, and are looking for another great RTS game set in the Dune universe, then don't bother looking here. The game can be fun, but dated graphics, bland map design and very uninteresting combat really tone the game down. It's hard to think that in the era of Command and Conquer, Starcraft and Total Annihilation, that Dune 2000 even exists.\",\n",

Having to go to class and stuff like that could have gotten in the way, but it's fairly easy to skip class if you want to, and once you've passed them all, not only do you not have to go anymore, but you get a lot of new moves and upgrades that help you out with the rest of the game.It's slightly awkward at times, but the story is entertaining, and this is probably the funniest video game I've ever played. It's stuffed to the brim with funny moments and dialogue from the various school kids. The combat system is fun too, you have plenty of moves to make fist fights enjoyable and there are a lot of clever non-lethal weapons to play with. It's a bit glitchy in spots, but it's definitely a fun experience.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Super Monkey Ball rolls onto the Wii with a solid single player mode, loads of decent mini-games and a pretty good control scheme. The game isn't exactly very taxing in terms of difficulty, but it is a good game to have a nice play on without making you sweat.The control in the game is obviously unique to the Wii contoller. It involves you tilting the remote in the direction you want your monkey to roll to and pressing A to jump. It has been well thoughtout except for a minor issue - when things are getting tense and nearing towards the three second countdown or when there is a thin ledge you need to go across, the controls let you down as they aren't tight enough and you'll find yourself blaming the controls more than your gaming skill (or lack thereof).In the single player mode you have to work your way round a bunch of different themed courses collecting bananas and avoiding obsticles. Although there are no enemies as such there are things that will attempt to shove you off the course and lose your life.There are a vast number of multiplayer mini-games (around about 50) in Super Monkey Ball and most of them are up to good standard and even if you don't like some, you've still got a load of other ones to choose from. Some mini-games are stuff like balancing your monkey while it walks across a tightrope or a slightly Mario Kart style racer. Other games include (but are not limited to) Simon Says, Monkey Battle and bowling.Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz is a good game for the Wii and it really is a friendly game to use which makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside when you use it. A Wii must have.\",\n",

The first time I loaded up the game I sat through the company logos and etc. I was then hit with the epic soundtrack and the opening menu \"Press Start\", so I did. Once into the main menu and the Start A New Career page, from here the(excusing the pun) Massiveness begins, you character can be customized from class, appearance, gender etc. You\\'ve then the choice on how to use your first Level Points. Level points are gained by as the name suggests leveling up throughout the game.Mass Effect is easy to master, with basic controls which are well explained and you\\'ll soon be blasting enemies with ease. There are great abilities your character can gain with special powers such as lifts, throws, sabotage, and various other was of harming your enemy\\'s. These powers are unlocked as you advance in levels and give you various advantages and a method of unlocking other options to use your well earned points on.By following the main storyline you barely scrape the surface of the storyline that makes up Mass Effect, there are 50+ side quests or as they are called here, Assignments.Mass Effect offers up to 50 hours of game play which depends on what you do during that playthrough. You can choose to become Paragon or Renegade, basically Good or Bad through the decisions you make when you talk to the many characters you can find in Mass Effect. There is usually 3 options on which to continue dialogue, all of which affect events of the game and gain you Paragon or Renegade points.Once the first mission is completed you have freedom to roam the universe on your spaceship and you can land on planets to scout for treasure and other items and so on. You land on a vehicle nicknamed \"Rover\" but officially called \"Mako\". The rover give you access to anywhere on a planet(once it\\'s within the boundary) and you can climb almost vertical mountains with the rover. Another positive is the on board guns.You have a choice of four weapons including, Pistols, Rifles, Shotguns, and Sniper Rifles.\\xa0 With many many to pick up, buy and scavenge from the Universe. Armour can be upgraded and like weapons can be found in their numbers from each class be it alien or human. The inventory of the game has many types and all come with descriptions, level meters and preview buttons.The voice acting of Mass Effect is top class with numerous people and no one voice the same although voiced by the same people. This does not give the repetitiveness that comes with the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic franchise. Mass Effect does not get a perfect five stars as there are bugs in the game which have yet to be patched and these range from game freezes, game restarts, getting stuck in the scenery and so on. However besides this it gets it\\'s four and a half rating for the sheer scale, amazing story, gameplay value, graphic wonders, amazing acting, brilliant lip animation, diversity and overall brilliance.

       "  'description': \"The Super Nintendo Entertainment System was home to arguably the greatest library of games on any single console. It had games that set new standards in graphic technology, and stretched 2D gaming beyond the limits of the imagination of the NES-era player. Super Metroid is one such game. As advertised, it contains console-gaming's first ever two-screen-tall boss, but this feat pales in comparison to the astounding quality of Super Metroid as a whole game experience. Its 2D, sprite-based graphics feature some truly amazing attention to detail; the open-ended gameplay structure allows for multiple pathways, serial-sequence breaking, and multiple endings; and the music and sound give Zebes an extremely lonesome atmosphere -- a necessary component of any Metroid game worth its weight in silicon. However, despite the ravings of rabid fanboys, it is NOT perfect, and its (admittedly minimal) flaws will be discussed in this review. Let us begin with the visuals.Super Metroid uses layered parallax scrolling extremely well. Though the game is entirely two-dimensional, the illusion of depth, and exploring a whole planet is present thanks to the well-designed and varied foregrounds, and backgrounds that -- in some areas -- appear to stretch on for miles. One is given the sense of being alone on a large planet. Of course, we have all been here before from the first Metroid, but there are many new areas that previously went unexplored, and the improved technical capabilities of the Super Nintendo are made evident when one compares the two games side by side.The creatures are also better looking, with more varieties of enemies, the addition of Space Pirates (above and beyond Ridley and Kraid), and several new mini-bosses and two new bosses makes this game's bestiary quite extensive; most of the aforementioned bosses and mini-bosses are sufficiently mean-looking. There is one mini-boss in particular with an EXTREMELY gruesome death, that, if suffered by a human, surely would have met with censorship at the time. That is how well it is presented. The number one strength of the visuals, though, are the details surrounding Samus herself. Samus' chest will heave as though she is breathing, when she is under water, bubbles will float from the front of her visor, and when she turns left and right, the transitions are smooth to give a believable illusion of a 3D model, without the requisite jagged edges. The visual effects, and subtle touches of detail make the game's (mostly textless) story all the more compelling.The game's story is not really emphasized in this game, except for the very beginning and the very end. And at the very end, not a single line of dialogue is entered, which makes sense, considering the various parties involved are all different species. But the way the conclusion is presented gives Super Metroid what is undoubtedly one of the most memorable endings in video game history, in spite of the ease with which the final boss can be defeated.However, Super Metroid's final boss is not representative of the challenge of all the bosses. Super Metroid's bosses are a decent challenge, but can be beaten by anyone able to recognize and exploit fairly basic patterns. The bosses in Metroid Prime 2: Echoes and Metroid Fusion are, for the most part, head and shoulders above Super Metroid in challenge and entertainment value by comparison.There is more to the gameplay than bosses, and the world-exploration and platforming elements are where Super Metroid most strongly shines. Thanks to certain latent abilities Samus has, the possibilities for sequence breaking on Zebes are almost endless. There are dozens of videos across the internet of interesting types of sequence breaking, as part of the global obsession with speed runs in video games. Seeing the variety in these videos -- and the experimentation this reviewer himself is capable of -- forces one to reach for superlatives to describe Super Metroid's open-ended nature.Samus also finds several weapons and power-ups, many of which are present in one or both of the first two Metroid games, but most of them are employed in new ways. The ways the different beams you can find can be combined with eachother and with power bombs are several of the best examples of the weapons unique to this game in the Metroid series. There are dozens of expansions of missiles, super missiles, power bombs, and energy tanks, and completionists will revel in the dozen or so hours it will take them to find EVERYTHING the first time through.And as players engage in the search for missing missiles, they will be accompanied by some of the best lo-fi music in any video game. All of the regions have their own song (some have two or more) and they all convey the environment and the tone of the game extremely well. Most are dark, rich numbers that surely a a weaker-willed character than Samus would not want on their jogging playlist on their iPod. However, Samus is stronger, and has confidence, thanks to the sound effects of her variety of weapons. Clearly the big booming sound of a charged up plasma/ice shot gives Samus the strength to carry on in such a gloomy, depressing landscape. Remember now, this was once her home planet.It isn't all flowers and sunshine on the audio side though. There are two noticeable flaws: the warning sound when Samus is running low on energy is extremely annoying, and so is the escape sequence music. That it sounds better on the NES should be sufficient evidence of the level of disappointment this causes.These two flaws are easily overshadowed by the rest of Super Metroid's strengths, namely its gameplay, visual presentation, and replay value. This game is deservedly considered one of the all-time greats. How it is overshadowed by its colleagues in the Nintendo library in that company's obsession with re-releasing games remains a mystery to this day. Quite simply, you should get a Super Nintendo to play this game if you don't already have one.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"The two main RPG styles are rarely broken - Japanese RPGs love their part fantasy part sci-fi settings with tween characters and Western ones are quite content with their monogomous relationship with Dungeons & Dragons. Occasionally you get a game that tiptoes out of such a description, but not very often. That in itself is enough reason to take a peek at Planescape: Torment, as while it carries D&D designation it takes that setting (and even style of gameplay) and warps it. With excellent results.  Torment is a role-playing game in every sense, and it's arguably the game's greatest strength. While there is unavoidable combat it isn't frequent, and there are large portions of the game that involve nothing but playing your character in a city full of interesting people. Whether you act good or evil or somewhere in between is entirely up to you.  You play as the Nameless One, a hideously scarred immortal with absolutely no recollection of who he is. This fuels the story, as you are constantly discovering things about his past, and the gameplay, as you cannot die. It also defies any genre conventions, as your character is definitely not a young, handsome, charismatic hero.  D&D peeks in via character classes, as you can play as a warrior, thief, or mage, depending on your preference (and you can switch through at will during the game if you want). Ultimately it makes no difference, although the game is certainly easier to play as a warrior - and being immortal means that those combat-oriented sections are do-able simply by charging the Nameless One ahead and killing a couple of enemies, dying and respawning, and then repeating the procedure. Your party members can be involved in combat, but as none of them are immune to death and healing items are in short supply, there is a strong incentive to simply pull them back most of the time. It doesn't help that very few characters actually have healing spells, and most areas do not allow resting to regain HP. Healing items and judicious use of the Nameless One are key.  All of your potential party members are extremely interesting, well-voiced (voiceovers are a bit too rare, though), and have fairly deep backstories. Some are obviously more prominent than others, but none could be called boring. They range from Morte, a hovering skull, to Ana, a half-fiend, to a perpetually burning mage, walking computer, succubus-turned-cleric, and more. Some join automatically and others require more devious methods to enlist.  The meat of the game lies in interacting with characters and reading text. Sounds boring, doesn't it? It's not. There are many varied quests, usually with alternate ways of completing them (often these are good/evil variants), many areas, and a lot of interesting characters with much to say. Dialogue exchanges are extremely well-written, as are the text descriptions of certain areas. There is an awful lot of writing in the game, to be fair, and often it feels like you're in an interactive novel rather than a game. This is in no way a bad thing unless you absolutely hate reading, of course, as Planescape: Torment is one of the best written games, period. You will care about the Nameless One, be interested in his story and those of your party members, and talk to each and every named NPC in the various areas just to see what they have to say.  The fact that the game lets you be good or evil or in-between is just a bonus. It's not half-assed, either, or as blatant as other games that advertise such a feature. Even simple questions from NPCs can often be answered six or seven different ways, depending if you want your character to lie or otherwise deceive someone. Little things like this creep in to affect your alignment, which in turn affects how people treat you. Even being completely evil is a viable way to play the game and will result in noticably different interactions with people.  If any complaints could be leveled at the game it's that the combat is somewhat unsatisfying (it's very similar to other Infinity-engine games such as Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale) and the overall length is short. But the length becomes much less of an issue given the replayability, as due to different alignments and the wealth of quests (and alternate endings) you'll certainly see something new the second time. Of course, there won't be any way you can just play the game once, anyway. It infects you.\",\n",

       "  'description': ' \\t\\t\\t..::The Good::.. >Responsive Controls. >Huge variety of tracks, old classics and new, imaginative, well designed courses. >The best Online Play seen on the Wii yet with almost no lag what-so-ever. >The same frantic and addictive fun from past Mario Kart titles.  >Snaking has been removed. >The new stunt system is great.  ..::The Bad::.. >Some Character Models are blocky. >Some characters voices are terrible >Friend Codes. >No Voice Chat Online.  When Mario Kart DS hit shelves, I think it is safe enough to get away with saying it was the best Mario Kart yet. It delivered the fun found in previous titles, topped it and added online play. Then Mario Kart Wii was announced, gamers got excited. Nintendo then revealed the Wii Wheel and playable Bikes. Gamers began to worry.   Well for all those that worried, shame on you. Mario Kart Wii still has the magic found in the previous titles; the familiar, addictive gameplay is there, only now it\\'s even better.   Lets get the basics out of the way first. There are 12 playable characters for you to choose from at the start, with a whole host to unlock. A couple of these hidden characters will surprise you, especially the one\\'s that haven\\'t appeared in a Mario Kart game yet. Each character is divided into their usual weight class once again; light, medium and heavy. At first each weight class has a choice of three different karts and bikes, but there are a lot more to unlock as you progress.  Like in Mario Kart DS, there are some new tracks and those that are old. The total amount of courses are 32 with 16 of them being new, well designed courses and the other 16 being carefully hand-picked classics. Although, some of the new tracks are curiously similar to ones in older Mario Kart titles (Luigi Circuit and Moo Moo Meadows have more than a slight ring of Double Dash!! and Mario Kart 64 to them). That said, the majority are fantastic and offer experiences never seen before with little quirks never in them.   For example, Koopa Cape has a downhill stream going through the middle of the track, so it is worth trying to time your powerslides so you go through the stream and get an extra speed boost.   The retro tracks have been given a polish, so even the SNES tracks look nice and 3D. Every game in the series has a representative (except the Arcade titles) with four N64, DS nad GameCube tracks and two tracks a piece from the SNES and GBA titles. So whatever your favourite Mario Kart game may be, there should be something here to keep you happy.   Of course, the proof is in the gameplay, the one area where all Mario Kart games are truly scrutinised. Thankfully,it\\'s great. Don\\'t be under the impression of all that, \"the Wii is a fancy GameCube\" rubbish, and that \"this is just an updated version of Double Dash!!\" If anything, it\\'s an updated version of Mario Kart DS (obviously much better looking). And that is not a bad thing.   Mario Kart Wii has four big gameplay differences. The first of these is the obvious inclusion of the Wii Wheel. Believe it or not, the wheel actually works. Sure it is just a plastic shell and shouldn\\'t really make a huge difference, but it really does add more atmosphere. What\\'s more, the steering has a larger \"dead-zone\" than Excite Truck did, meaning there is a reasonable degree of leeway in how much you can turn the wheel before your kart starts turning. Thus giving you more control.   If the Wii Wheel isn\\'t your think, you can try out one of the other control methods Mario Kart Wii has up for selection. The Wiimote and Nunchuck, Gamecube Controller or Classic Controller. In all honesty, I prefer the Wii Wheel over going old-school with the GameCube or Classic Controllers, I thought the opposite was going to happen.   The second big difference is the removal of snaking. Ever since the N64 game, Mario Kart had included the ability to get a speed boost by waggling the controls left and right as you powerslide. This has finally been scrapped, and now your speed boost is determined by how long you can hold your slide. This really does make the online feel more fun instead of having the usual snake-fest.  Thirdly there are now \"tricks\" that can be performed by flicking the control upwards after going off a jump, giving you a nice speed boost once landing. There is no danger of failing the trick or having to learn tricky button combinations. It totally changes the way you think about races and is a great substitute for snaking.   Finally, the bikes. They were a controversial inclusion, but the truth is the work very well. Sure they are a little harder to control than karts as they turn more and quicker bbut the only main difference is that instead of getting orange sparks when performing a powerslide, bikes can only get blue boosts. This may seem unfair, but in return bikes can perform wheelies by flicking the controller up at any time.   As if all this wasn\\'t enough, the online options are the best ever seen on a Nintendo console. You can take part in enormous 12-player races, create your own private race room and download challenges and ghost records sent by Nintendo which are ranked worldwide. You can even use your friends list to compare your Time Trail records of your pals anf, if they\\'re slower, send them your ghost data for that lap and challenge them to beat it. And to top that off, the online play features pretty much no lag at all. I myself haven\\'t featured any and I hope it will stay that way.   Despite initial fears, Mario Kart Wii is actually one of the most enjoyable racing games and Wii game that I have ever played. This is fantastic fun and whether you are a casual gamer or Mario kart die-hard, this is truly an essential game; one that you will be playing for months to come. ',\n",

       "  'description': \"It's a little hard to rate Dreamfall, but what it hinges on is whether you think a game that clearly ignores gameplay in favor of story is worthy of a good score if that story is good. If you don't you will hate Dreamfall. But I choose to view it as more of an interactive story than a normal game, which is what it was designed to be, and it succeeds well at that.The gameplay is pretty bad... the normal adventure gameplay is okay, but fairly simple. The main problems come from the stealth elements, which are poorly realized, and the combat, which is completely putrid. It's comically bad. It also makes one of the three characters you play seem completely worthless, as his story is much less fleshed out than that of the other two and all he does is fight a few people.But what the game focuses on, the writing and story, are excellent. The characters are generally very well developed and sympathetic, and especially in the magical world of Arcadia, often quite funny. Some awkward animations slightly reduce the effectiveness of the dialogue and voice acting which is much more believable than most games. Despite a couple bits like the increasingly cliche creepy little girl and evil mega corporation, the story is a unique and deeply engrossing tale that grabbed me and kept me playing late into the night to find out how it will all end, which unfortunately it really didn't. The game ends on a cliffhanger with many threads left unresolved, and I hope the final game is released somewhat soon so I can see the end. I do know I will definitely be checking out the first game to see what happens there in the meantime.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Damn!That was pretty much my initial reaction to playing Metal Gear Solid 4. I was all hyped, but I had it in the back of my mind that I might be disappointed. We all remember that first demo, where Kojimi showed off the infamous ball-grab in the heat of the Middle East. By the time I got to the first big battle, I was floored. The intensity of trying to stay hidden in the midst of massive explosions had absolutely astounded me. From then on, I knew I was right where I wanted to be. The game controls the best of all the Metal Gear games. MGS4 takes the third person camera from Subsistence and modernizes the shooting controls with an updated aiming system and the addition of Octocamo. Octocamo fixes one of the main problems from MGS3: having to pause the game to change your camo. This way, it's easier to get the camo you want and stay hidden from the enemy. The story is the best it has ever been. The cutscenes are absolutely stunning, featuring some of the best graphics we have ever seen on the PS3 or any platform that isn't the PC. The camera cuts and the presentation are very cinematic, but it's so much more than that. The cut scenes are long, but not 90 minutes as some had claimed before the games release. But, if you've been a fan of Metal Gear, you come to expect, and appreciate these epic cutscenes. The game is split up into 5 acts, each taking place in a different area. This way, the game stays visually fresh, as well as keeping the gameplay fresh. You'll get the building infiltration of classic Metal Gear as well as the outdoor areas of MGS3 as well as some other suprises. The boss battles are intense and play heavily on your knowledge of the previous games, as does pretty much everything else in the game. This is the ultimate fan service, but it's also the ultimate Metal Gear experience. \",\n",

I've been keeping an eye on this game ever since it's release, but due to not having a Xbox 360 at the time I never had a chance to play it and eventually lost interest in it. Fast forward months ahead when I do have the Xbox 360. I was at a local game retailer and I saw BioShock on the shelf for $39.99 used. Since I had the cash on me and still interesting in playing it, I purchased it. I was expecting a few hours long campaign, and low replay value since there was no multiplayer or anything to keep you interested after wards. Now let's start the review and you'll see what I saw as it's high points and what are it's lows.  BioShock starts you off in the shoes of the protagonist who was mysteriously involved in a plane crash over the ocean, strangely over the magnificent underwater city known as Rapture. Slowly the pieces of the story form over the time you play the game, which come together as a great story that is one of the reasons you should play this game.   First off, BioShock is a graphically amazing game. No one can really deny this fact. Rapture and it's inhabitants are visually appealing. Even though you are in the deepest depth of the ocean the environments are clean, spooky, and above all stunning. Just looking out the windows around the city you'll see other parts of the city in the distance which are worth the few seconds of time you could be using to smash a splicer's head in with a wrench.   One of my personal favorite aspects of the game is the use of plasmids that make up one side of your arsenal. From lightening strikes to setting cyclone traps to telekinesis to even shooting hornets towards the enemies, you can customize your arsenal of plasmids to fit your style. Besides plasmids there's conventional weaponry such as: a pistol, shotgun, machine gun, grenade launcher, and a few others to make your stroll through Rapture a bit more fun. Ammunition is never scarce in BioShock. With the ammunition vending machines and general supplies vending machine, combined with spread out drops, and enemy drops you should have enough ammo at all times. Plasmids on the other hand use EVE as the fuel to work. EVE is found through out the game in syringe-type vials, and also in vending machines.   Besides plasmids and weaponry, there's these things called tonics. They are equipped same was plasmids, but aren't used in direct combat. Tonics are categorized in categories such as: engineering, physical, and so on. Some tonics are used for making hacking safes, security bots, vending machines, and those types of things faster and easier, others are used to increase strength with the wrench, or even give you camouflage when standing still. There's a lot of tonics to collect, so you can switch them around and test them out as you see fit.   When decide to purchase some tonics or plasmids you'll notice normal cash doesn't do it. To buy plasmids and tonics you'll need the heavily sought after ADAM. ADAM is what these little girls called Little Sisters harvest from dead bodies and such around Rapture. To get the ADAM you can't simply ask for it, or kill her to get it. Big Daddies, the hardest enemies in the game, are their protectors. Big Daddies are heavily armored and usually equipped with a huge drill or grenade launcher weapon. All in all they're not the hardest thing in the world to kill if you know how to handle them using various types of ammunition, such as the electro-buck, anti-personnel bullets, etc. After you take down the Little Sister's Big Daddy, you can choose to harvest her for 160 ADAM, or rescue her for 80 ADAM. For rescuing Little Sister's you do get a reward from it, woman you meet along the way will send you rewards after saving so many. Also harvesting/rescuing has some ending game differences.   The characters in this game also make the game seem even more real. When you pick up a recorder in BioShock, it's similar to files in a game like Resident Evil, but these are all audio records, no reading in this game! The audio recordings will fill you in on background characters, and their little bit of input on the story. Audio records can also give you codes to locked doors, and information for certain parts of the game. The voice acting in this game is spot on, every character seems real and most are all insane.   Andrew Ryan is the man you will hear the most crap from throughout the game. He will tell you how you're making no difference and why he's so right. He built that city with no religion or government to get in the way of science. He got his city, but something went wrong and it's no more than an underwater tomb. Andrew Ryan tries his best to kill you or stop you along the way, he makes a great antagonist, the kind that makes your trip to him worth the long walk and time.  There is much more to this game I could tell you, but I don't want to completely spoil the experience of the game. This is a game that a vast audience will enjoy. First person shooter and survival horror fans will find this to be a great time, and you will enjoy the ride that is BioShock.\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'A great introduction to the Wii and its wacky new controller.',\n",
       "  'description': \"Back at E3 in 2006, Nintendo held a press conference at the Kodak Theatre displaying Wii Sports. It was simply a demo and only a basic version of the game tennis on the released version of the game. On the 14th of September 2006 the Wii release date was announced, the fact it would be included 'free' in the Wii package (excluding Japan) and two new games - Bowling and Boxing - were announced.Wii Sports features five sports - Tennis, Baseball, Bowling, Golf and Boxing. Tennis is the most well known and because four players can play all at once, is the most multi-player friendly. You do not have to move your Mii but simply swing at the correct time in order to hit your ball over the net in hope that the other player will mess up their shot or simply not reach it it in time. Normal tennis rules apply, of course (deuce, out, etc). Sadly though, you don't really get the feel you are in control of where the ball goes.Baseball lets you and a friend take turns in batting and bowling, batting being the most fun. Bowlers simply hold down either A, B or AB to determine what kind of throw they do. They then swing their controller down (how fast they do this also affects the ball) which makes the ball leave their hand on-screen and fly towards the batter. The batter then has to swing at the correct time in order to run round. How far they run round depends on how good their swing was (the ball will go further). This is basically all you have to do as the game will automatically run you round and make your characters run for the ball once it has been hit which is a downside as you feel it would be quite fun to do this yourself.In Bowling you use the same actions as you would in real life. Swing back, forward and then release (not the remote, obviously). This works very well and the physichs are very good. The only downside here is once you've mastered the technique it really isn't very hard to get strikes nearly all the time.In Golf you choose the strength of your swing by how fast you swing the remote in a golfing action. You can adjust the direction of your shot using the D-Pad, which you will need to do due to the wind which will affect the course of the ball. Swinging the controller too fast will make your strength meter go into the red which will make the ball go of course (much like the wind does). Golf is a good game but can be hard to master.Boxing is the only sport to use the Nunchuk attachment. You hold the Remote and Nunchuk in separate hands and then punch in the air which is supposed to be copied precisely on screen. In reality this isn't true and you'll find yourself getting really annoyed as you are swinging wildly but your character isn't doing what you tell it too. Apart from this boxing is good and very tiring.Wii Sports makes heavy use of the Miis and not just your own. In Tennis and Boxing Miis from the Mii Plaza will appear in the crowd and also as bowlers in Bowling. In Baseball other Miis on your console will appear on both teams. All the computer characters are also generated Miis. This is fun as it is always nice to have familiar faces around.Graphically Wii Sports isn't exactly revolutionary and the sound is mediocre. A downside of the game is that after a while you will get a bit bored of it and you may only use it when newbies to the Wii come round your house. Having saying this, the use of the Wii remote is put into fantastic use and this is a great introduction to the Wii for you, family and friends.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Did you know that there is a new Incredible Hulk movie out? Just in case you wondering know it's not a coincidence that there's also a new Hulk game out. The Incredible hulk is a movie tie-in game. It was not meant to be a revolutionary piece of art, it's meant to make bucket loads of cash and there's no doubt that it will.The Incredible Hulk is set in a completely destructible version of New York City. You'll recognize real life buildings like the Empire State building and even some buildings from the Marvel Universe like Stark Tower. Oh, and yes you will be able to make them all crumble to the ground. Every object you see on the streets can be picked up and used as a weapon against the bad guys or even innocent citizens. This adds a slight bit of depth to the games shallow game play.The Incredible Hulk's missions are highly repetitive. Every mission basically the same, destroy, destroy and destroy. After the first five missions you will have experienced everything the game has to offer when it comes to game play. There is still some incentive to play through though, the game has a system where you can earn upgrades by destroying things, how original of them. Lucky for us though is that the upgrades can be quite cool. They can range from new even more destructive moves to in-game secrets.The Hulk looks great in this game, everything else not so much. There's plenty of room to explore in New York City it's just to bad that everything looks very familiar and quite ugly. For example the billboards in the game are all fuzzy and hard to look at, not to mention there all shameless plugs of other Sega franchises. Open World games have always had graphical problems but more recently they've been improving, but with the Incredible Hulk it really does feel like one step forwards and two steps back. The pop-in is terrible and the frame rate plays up a little too often. Not to mention the game just completely froze multiple times during my play through. It's these things that really make the game feel 'Cheap'.The story of the Incredible Hulk is split into two main storylines. The Hulk's dealings with the Army, and his trying to fight off an alien like group called 'The Enclave' with newfound friend Rick Jones. Both of these are very dull and very disjointed. You can skip all the cut scenes and it wouldn't make a difference.The sound is very plain and just not well done. It seems very rushed. For example if I were to throw a car into a building it would make the same sound as me throwing a small person into the same building. Some of the movies voice actors reprised there respected roles in the game but that doesn't make it any good. The dialogue is very poor quality and it stutters sometimes.\\xa0The Incredible Hulk is a game that was clearly rushed and only made to rake in the cash. At the very most this game warrants a rent. The first hour or two of playing is surprisingly fun. But once you get to the point where you realise that you've experienced all the game has to offer in such a short time you just want to put it down.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"When compared to Xbox Live Arcade, the Playstation Network has kind of been a bit lackluster. Games like Echochrome, fl0w, and Calling all Cars can be fun, but apart from a few exceptions, the online service doesn't have much in the way of awesome games. Thankfully, Super Stardust HD is one of those few exceptions. The Amiga series has translated to the Playstation 3 beautifully, and many (including myself) will likely declare it their favorite dual-stick shooter of all time.While Geometry Wars looked pretty, Super Stardust HD blows it out of the water. The developers have done an amazing job with the technical graphics and the art direction. Visually, this is the best looking game on the Playstation Network, and with great-looking games like Warhawk to compete against, that's a great feat to accomplish. The sound direction is also very memorable, with unique and catchy songs for each of the games five planets. Overall, the team at Housemarque have created a game that's endlessly fun to play. For $10, this is a fantastic deal. With high score tables and trophies, you'll definitely get your money's worth, and more. Super Stardust HD is the must-own title on the Playstation Network. While it won't move any systems, it's one of the best values, and games, this generation.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Way back in the middle of the SNES days Nintendo introduced the FX chip in a number of its cartridges. As per the usual naming conventions started with the Super Nintendo and putting 'Super' in front of half the game titles and later continued with the Nintendo 64 and putting '64' after half the game titles, FX games were denoted with the FX. Star Fox FX was the first of its kind, sporting flat-shaded polygonal graphics roughly on par with what Sega's 32X would later produce. They certainly weren't impressive by any measure, but had the good fortune of being the only real 3D graphics produced on the console. A handful of other games used the chip, but to more subtle effect (as in Yoshi's Island, which used the FX chip for scaling and rotating sprites). The other big 3D FX game that very closely resembled Star Fox was Stunt Race FX, a purely 3D racing game featuring vehicles with eyeballs.  Stunt Race FX is organized in typical racing fashion, featuring a number of circuits - including one locked one - and your usual assortment of time trials. The stunt courses differ slightly, but we'll get to them later.  The vehicle roster includes three standard vehicles that sacrifice one thing for another - on the low end is a sturdy monster truck with massive tires, featuring high acceleration and low top speed and the ability to drive straight through patches of water without losing speed. In the middle, a little yellow coupe with average abilities all around; and on the end, a misshapen and flimsy red formula one style car with mediocre acceration but frightening top speed. Each car is affixed with eyeballs planted roughly where the headlights would be - and we're not just talking static eyebally fixed in the grille of the vehicle, but large floating eyeballs that blink and look around while the car is driving and periodically engage in a disturbing 360 rotation as if to make sure you're still paying attention. In all honesty, those eyeballs are kind of cute and help establish the silly sort of feel that Stunt Race FX has.  Also present is one unlockable super-vehicle (hey, it might as well be, as it's vastly superior to every other vehicle, albeit a bit too fast for its own good) and one particularly unwieldly one that's driven in a bonus level in the middle of championships. The unlockable vehicle is a motorcycle - it features great acceleration, high top speed, and has massive tires just like the monster truck. It outclasses all the other cars to an almost ridiculous degree, although it can become difficult to drive as a result. The bonus vehicle is a huge semi-trailer that's driven from a fixed 3/4 perspective. It's as slow and clunky as you'd expect, which is fine given its purpose - all you have to do is finish a lap or two in order to increase the number of restarts you have for a given championship.  The three championships are broken up into four races with a bonus level inserted between the second and third. These function in typical fashion although instead of points being distributed the best accumulated time wins.  The courses are divided up into a number of areas - there is the sunny meadow setting, a mountaneous area, marine backdrop, snow level, and cityscape. They are filled with elevation changes and the occasional hazard (such as falling rocks or crossing deer on the mountain levels). The more devious segments of the tracks involve halfpipes, which are more than willing to send your car sailing over the edge of the course if you lose control. A few of the more evil halfpipes have pieces cut out of them, requiring you to ride the side for fear of falling to your doom.  Boost and damage meters are your only gauges of interest during a race. Boost functions as you'd expect, and can be refilled by running over blue crystals that appear at intervals of the track. Damage fills up by ramming into walls and other cars and course hazards, and can be reduced by running over appropriately coloured red crystals. Damage isn't without penalty, either, as your car can only take so much damage before exploding into little pieces and eyeballs, forcing you to restart the level.  The controls are simple enough - you have your gas, brake, and d-pad for steering. The shoulder buttons act as an analog facsimile, engaging a tighter turn. The 90 degree corners require careful use of this. There is also a boost button and a bizarre horn/jump button. This sounds your horn and pops the chassis of your car up in the air for a couple of seconds. It sounds useless, but on tight segments of courses where you want to pass the opposition, launching your car up will let you drive right over them.  Sounds good enough? It gets better. One of the most amusing parts of Stunt Race FX involves the stunt tracks. There are four of them, each starting you in the back of a semi and requiring you to run through each segment of the arena collecting stars. They are placed on a whole host of obstacles, from simple mounds poking up from the ground to long jumps and elevated platforms. You have to collect them all in each segment of the course to unlock the door to the next, and all of this also has to be completed before the timer counts down. Some of the courses can be quite tricky, as portions almost require you to be traveling at a certain speed in order to make a jump onto an otherwise unreachable platform.  The cream of the stunt tracks is a little RC arena where the goal is to ram into the other three cars and blow them to pieces, with the fastest time being recorded. These take place from the same sort of fixed view as the truck bonus levels and add a remote-control feeling to the proceedings. Skidding your vehicle around while chasing down the erratically driving opposition is a lot of fun, and makes the explosions that much more satisfying.  Where the game has few faults in the gameplay, the same can't be said about the presentation. Hobbled in a way by the FX chip itself, the game is unable to produce its 3D graphics at anything more than roughly 15 frames per second (if that). You get used to it, but given the somewhat sparse nature of simple shaded polygons, the game can seem a bit bare at times. It also has a side effect of making turns a bit hard to judge, as you have to adjust a bit to compensate for the crude framerate. Also dragging it down is the actual viewing area, which is roughly half of the full TV screen. Two-player mode is present, but the viewing areas are even smaller and the already atrocious framerate drops further.  Sound is decent enough. It and the music aren't particularly offensive, which is probably the best thing that can be said about them. They don't excel, but they don't ruin the experience either.  Overall, Stunt Race FX is a blast. The very nature of its format can provide the occasional headache, but the game itself is so full of wacky fun that once you've completed a handful of races, the small viewing area and low framerate won't really bother you. And the image of eyeball-endowed cars won't soon leave your mind.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'When I first heard that Alone in the Dark was being remade, I was all for seeing what they could do with the series and try to compete with the hugely popular Resident Evil series by Capcom. Anyway on with the review.Graphiaclly Alone in the Dark uses it\\'s engines dark and light textures to a good extent, the contrast of the two types are used well in the game creating more of an atmosphere that you are Alone in the Dark. Dynamic lighting in the game is used very well, since that was the main focus of the developer\\'s engine, except fire of course. Fire in the game is a great technical achievement, with it spreading across wooden object like any fire normally would, whilst not making the game engine lag or being graphically deficient. Overall Alone in the Dark\\'s graphics suit the game very well, even though it may suffer from a few graphical glitches from time to time.As for the sound, I found Alone in the Dark to be quite quiet for some reason. I don\\'t know if this was thanks to my speaker setup, but I had to end up turning up the sound louder than I would normally have too. Quality wise however, Alone in the Dark delivers. With each explosion, scream of agony and voice acting sounding great. However, the voice actors I thought could get a little annoying due to the fact that almost every second or third word out of their mouth was a swear word. Overall Alone in the Dark\\'s sound delivers to set an atmosphere, even though the voice acting is annoying at times it\\'s still great overall.The gameplay is the real hero for Alone in the Dark, using the X360 controller to it\\'s full extent it feels refreshing to know that you\\'ll be doing far more than your average, press \"Y\" \"X\" \"A\" \"B\". Also, the real-time inventory is a cool feature, giving it a more real feel than pressing a button to open a separate inventory screen. Combining items is refreshing feature also, rather than \"Here\\'s a gun, go kill stuff.\" Such combinations as a lighter and mosquito spray or a cloth and bottle to form a molotov cocktail can be great fun to execute. The real time inventory is also incorporated into the healing section, with yourself applying bandages and heal sprays to yourself. Also Eden seems to have realised that people can only carry a certain amount of things, for instance when I played Oblivion I could have tonnes of stuff in my \"invisible bag\" and still run around at light speed. Overall Alone in the Dark\\'s gameplay is refreshing, and something that most people should enjoy.The only real concern I have about this game, are the driving sequences. In chapter 2 you will have to go through one of these very sequences, and while it may have been an exciting and cool premise, it\\'s executed very poorly. Due to poor handling and buggy scripts. For instance, I crashed into a car and had to remain stationary for a few moments and the road in which I would have to go over in a few moments collapsed. Now, I know this was not meant to happen as afterwards I went through the same sequence and the road collapsed after I had driven across it.All in all, Alone in the Dark is a refreshing or new experience, which survival horror fans and gamers should enjoy.',\n",

       "  'description': \"I got the first No One Lives Forever game when it came out in late 2000, but thanks to a frustrating series of events, I didn't complete it until six years later. The game ran poorly on my Windows 98 POS computer, and stuttered its way through outdoor environments even at the lowest settings. I didn't advance far before the computer crapped out and I lost my save, and lost my interest for a while. Later we got a new machine, and the game ran perfectly. I got much farther in the game before the hard drive pooped out and I lost my save again. In the Fall of 2005, I got my own computer, which kicked the old one's ass, and checked the game out, but was preoccupied and didn't get around to actually playing through it a year later. Despite this long, painful road to completion, I still saw how good a game it was.It doesn't have the amazing gameplay and physics engine of Half-Life 2, and some of the cinemas seem awkward, but it's quite a good stealth-based shooter. I say stealth-based, but rarely do you actually have to be stealthy, most of the time you can just cap fools as you please. The game's brilliance mostly comes from the writing, which is both hilarious and intelligent for most video games. It creates a fun and self-referential world that's fun to be a female James Bond in. If you never played it, you should look past the now-dated engine and graphics and give it a go.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"The good stuff: - Strong, competitive online community. - Robust mutators and rules allow for very customizable matches. - Warfare offers solid vehicular mayhem, with some strategic depth. - Detailed graphics which scale well on mid-range machines. The bad stuff: - Few changes to the game from past iterations. - A clumsy, cluttered and featureless browser makes it awkward to set up and join matches.  Unreal Tournament 3 once again brings fast-paced, action-packed gameplay in well crafted and highly detailed maps. You've likely played it before, but Unreal Tournament 3 makes it feel fresh again. Fast-paced arena deathmatch shooters aren't as popular as they used to be. But Unreal Tournament 3 manages to thrive with a variety of maps, gameplay modes and a competitive community.  In Unreal Tournament 3, you aim to be the winner by racking up kills. There is a wide range of weapons at your disposal, each of which have two firing modes. Each weapon also feels completely different from one another. You could be holding the link gun which shoots out projectiles of plasma, or can shoot out a continuos stream which is useful for close-range. Alternatively, you can use the flak cannon which shoots out metal shrapnel in rounds, which spread out and can bounce of walls. Of course, there is also the sniper rifle for anyone who wants to hang back.  If you're not up for deathmatch, then you can partake in capture the flag, vehicle capture the flag or warfare. Capture the flag and it's vehicle counterpart are self explanatory. Capture the flag grants you the translocator, which allows you to teleport around the map. Vehicle capture the flag has much bigger maps, and allows you to control vehicles but not carry the flag in them. Instead, you use the hoverboard to go around which also allows you to grapple onto friendly vehicles. If you get hit by a weapon tough, you will fall off and be stunned for three seconds.  The main attraction to the game tough is warfare. Warfare has you split up into two teams, in which you battle across large maps and battling over 'nodes'. Nodes need to be linked together by your team, to capture the next nearest node. Eventually, you will link to the oposing teams core which will make your team victorious when destroyed. This can be done by capturing and holding the nodes, or by using the orb which spawns at your base to instantly capture nodes. There are also countdown nodes, which don't need to be linked to. These usually spawn extra vehicles, or cause damage to the oposing team's core.  There is a wide variety of vehicles, split up into 'Axon' and 'Necris'. Axon has your more conventional vehicles. There's a fast moving but weakly armored hovering vehicle called the 'Manta' which is great for scouting and dealing with infantry. There is also the 'Goliath' which is a very powerful tank, the 'Scorpion' who's projectiles lock onto very light vehicles and can self-destruct causing devastating damage and there is also the 'Raptor' which is a flying vehicle loaded with missiles. The necris vehicles are all very interesting, and are rather unique. The 'Darkwalker' is a huge walking tripod of death with twin lasers (a bit like from 'War of the Worlds'). There is also the 'Scavenger' which can scale walls and roll up into a ball and the 'Nightshade' which is stealthed and can deploy EMP mines, slow volumes and shields.   Unreal Tournament 3 looks great. It isn't a masterpiece, but levels and environments are highly detailed, even far beyond the playing area. What's even more impressive is that the game runs very smoothly, even on mid-range PC's with little graphical sacrifice. Vehicles blow up nicely too. They disintegrate and show damage when loosing health, and does the opposite when being repaired. At times, it's hard to not be distracted by the gorgeous environments.  If you want to play a match with bots, there are tons of customisable options. You can change the time limit, the amount of players, the score to win and you can select from a range of 'Mutators' which can drasticly alter the gameplay. You can set low gravity, the weapons involved, quadruple jumps, no power-ups and even enable the 'Instagib rifle' where one shot kills.  If you're looking for a fast-paced, adrenaline soaked shooter with a variety of customizable options and a strong competitive community, then Unreal Tournament is for you. It doesn't make many changes to the formula from it's predecessors, but it still feels fresh and provides a welcome change of pace.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'More blood, more gore, more guts, that\\'s the difference from the original God of War and that\\'s a good thing too.  The story in God of War 2 is Kratos has been betrayed by Gods of Olympus. They are not releasing him from the torment they put him thorugh in the first game. You start off as the new God of War. Kratos is bored while he is watching his Spartan army get defeated in a war. So he decides he wants to blow s*** up. The Gods will not allow this and now they all want Kratos dead. The opening level is madness. Kratos has Godly powers and no one can stop him. Kratos gets the Blade of Olympus which he has to empty all of his Godly powers in. Zeus has betrayed and killed Kratos but he is rescued by Gaia, the last of the titans, who gives you a task to go to The Sisters of Fate, so he can go back to the time Zeus betrayed and killed him. From this point on you go on a quest filled with puzzels and action you will never forget.  The graphics in the game are astonishing, the best you will ever see in a PS2 game. The attention to detail shows how hard the developers worked on making this the most beautiful game on the PS2. You will see arrows flying in the backround, and other people fighting your enemy\\'s. The hi-res cut scenes look amazing as well. You will be thinking \"How does the PS2 handle this game!\".  Another returning aspect is the great soundtrack that plays at the right time when it\\'s intense action going on you\\'ll hear intence music but when it starts to get more mellow you will hear mellow music. Great orchestral and choir riffs will leave you humming the tunes when you are done playing.   The weapons are also really good, there\\'s the returning Chain Blades that are bound to Kratos\\' wrists. A war hammer that is powerful but slow. A spear that has a really long reach. There are also a few magical powers. A lightning power will stun your enemies and allow you to make a few hits with your weapon. A bow made of magic which can help in a lot of tight situations and boss battles. The titans rage where rocks come bounding out of the eart and onto your enemies. The last and returning magical power is the Medusa\\'s Gaze which lets you freeze your enemies and then break them.  There are a few gliches that made me have to reboot the system because of me getting stuck on ledges, cutscences not activating. That\\'s the only thing keeping it from a perfect score. There are no lag issues surprisingly.  God of War 2 is an extremely enjoyable ride thorughout that you would\\'nt want to miss. This is a great game to close out the PS2\\'s life.',\n",

       "  'description': 'With a name like Gunstar Heroes, it is hard not to at least get a sense of the goings-on in this Wii Virtual Console tribute to a Genesis classic. It follows \"Gunstar Red\" (and Gunstar Blue if you have a friend with whom to play) on a quest to retrieve the Mystical Gems stolen by the evil Colonel Red and his cronies. In other words, this is your standard story of heroes using guns to vanquish evil. It provides some mildly interesting context for your actions, but little else. Gunstar Heroes\\' strength is not its story, it is the gameplay.When you start a game in Gunstar Heroes, you are taken to a screen that allows you to choose your starting weapon. You will have a choice between two shooting styles, one that allows you to walk and shoot, the other that allows you 8-way control of your weapon while standing. The weapon choices seem pretty meager at first, but when the Gunstars grab other weapons in the course of their adventure, they can combine them in different ways to get different weapons -- everything from flames you can move about the screen for several seconds at a time to a laser sword -- and they all have their own upsides and downsides, but chances are you will find a personal favourite, and use it for the majority of the game. Of course, the Gunstars are talented beyond the mutually dependent abilities to run and gun, they are quite acrobatic. The Gunstars can hang-drop of cliffs, shimmy along poles, wall jump, throw one another as well as their enemies, and kick slide; and even the second half of the wall jump is an attack! And in terms of co-operative gameplay, this is the best there is for the Virtual Console at the moment. Of course, there is more to how a video game plays than how the characters play; the enemies play a huge role.And in Gunstar Heroes, the grunt enemies are pretty forgettable, they have your standard array of attacks to avoid, but a large number are thrown at you at once. It makes the gameplay frantic and intense. However, the bosses are the stars of the show. One boss in particular has many different forms it cycles through, and each boss and mini-boss has different sets and sequences of attacks to keep players from the lethargic practice of pattern recognition and breaking that bogs down many other side-scrolling shooters. The bosses\\' patterns break and shift quite often, and for the most part, they challenge (and occasionally frustrate) even the most experienced Metal Sluggers or Contra Killers. However, the game is beatable; especially on the Wii.The Wii automatically saves state whenever you quit (to menu, not turn off) any Virtual Console game. In Gunstar Heroes, a game without saves or passwords but unlimited continues, this feature waters the game down. However, it is this writer\\'s opinion that an absence of save or password features in games made in the last 15 years is an artificial way of increasing difficulty, and as a result of the Wii functionality, Gunstar Heroes is exposed as a short game, even for an old-school shooter. Having said all this, the content that is there is eminently enjoyable and challenging, so much so that it is worth playing multiple times.A big part of the total package, even of Genesis-era games, is the audio-visual experience. Gunstar Heroes features imaginative character design, a lively animation style, with a fairly consistent frame rate, however; epileptics should NOT play this game. It features bright, flashing colours and rapid movement; it can give some people headaches, and some others will get far more severe reactions. This is a warning people need to take seriously.The music, when it rises above the din of gunfire and death, has its moments; but does not match the best the era or the genre has to offer. It does the job and little more. The aforementioned sound effects also represent the standard Genesis audio fare.As a whole, Gunstar Heroes is a perfect Genesis port for the Wii Virtual Console and is a fun and affordable co-operative game. If you are waiting for the Contras to come, this game can satiate you and a friend until the day that sweet bounty comes.***Post-Contra-Release Notes***Gunstar Heroes is better than all Contra games on the Virtual Console.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Is it wrong to enjoy raining blood and body parts on the heads of your enemies? Of course, in order to do so you have to land one or two cocktails (or more...nothing wrong with excessive explosions) in their midst and hope the fuse doesn't fail. Then you'll be rewarded with a handful of muffled booms, cries of dismay, and several completely unlucky soldiers bursting at the seams and sending their flesh and entrails spinning high into the air, bouncing down off their comrades' heads, and staining the ground. And to accompany all the wanton carnage, you have your dwarven explosives expert cackling to himself as he watches the enemies ripped into pieces by his handiwork. Then tosses another one down the hill for an even more graphic display as the rest of the already weakened soldiers fly apart and the body parts previously scattered are thrown clear by the second blast.  Height is a key advantage, especially with dwarves. Why are dwarves mentioned so much? Well, because they're the most useful character and result in the most glorious carnage. On one snow level your forces are placed at the top of a gentle rise that leads down to a wide open plain. You could stay there and fight a fair fight against the enemies, or you could run down a narrow valley to one side, put your dwarves around and up at the top of the valley, line your archers near the end, and cluster your soldiers right by the last walled part of the valley. The subsequent mess (and it is a mess) is both glorious and satisfying, as wave after wave of enemies cram themselves into the valley and are rewarded with dwarven molotov cocktails and the chance to paint the oh-so-white snow red. By the time the assault has stopped (a few lucky ones might actually manage to make it to your soldiers in time to be massacred lovingly by hand) the snowy valley is red with blood and black with explosions, and weapons and pieces of armor are lying everywhere with only a few body parts remaining...the series of explosions have done nothing but disintigrate them. Tips of the higher cliff along one side will have red streaks from the occasional flying arm that struck it and rolled down. And your dwarves will be even more psychotic than before, with dozens more messy kills under their belt.  The combat is unparalleled in a real-time strategy game, as Bungie's I-ain't-dealing-with-no-stinking-base-and-resources attitude carries over in full force. You get a handful of units at the start of the quest, and other than a few rare occasions where you find more, that's all you get. Don't get them all killed. And definitely don't let them run down an embankment towards your foes only to have your dwarf lob a cocktail in their midst. Your men won't like that very much, even if your dwarf will.  It provides a challenge without being mind-numbingly hard, and is infinitely more strategic than something like Starcraft, where the easiest way to get things accomplished is to amass a huge force and just send them all in at once. If you try that in Myth, it may work, but that next battle in the level will be even harder seeing as you stupidly sacrificed some of your soldiers on a frontal assault.  The graphics were good, even with all the units rendered as 2D sprites. The sound fit well, from the narrator to unit cries and laughter, and music. It improved on the first game's unit management, especially with regards to formations and pointing your troops in a certain direction. Outdoor levels received buildings and interactive pieces, and indoor levels were added (though they're arguably not as good as the wide-open outdoor levels). There really isn't much one could complain about Myth II, unless you're one of the folks who isn't completely happy unless you have a group of resource gathering units milling around and a base to micromanage. Micromanaging units is so much more fun, and causing complete bloody mayhem while doing so is even more fun.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'As we all know british developer infinity ward managed to create something which was able to combat with EA\\'s WWII title, Medal of Honour. For 3 games we have been travelling through the same old recycled battles of WII: D-Day, Moscow etc. And it became tediously dull and boring for most of us. That was until Call of Duty 4 came along.I.F. (Infinity Ward) released a BETA of the games MP to Xbox 360 to certain gamertags, however the BETA was leaked onto a massive scale and everyone began playing it. This was probably a good thing for I.F. for it gave them a chance to show almost every gamer in the world what the games MP would be like. I doubt it would be as popular if most of XBL ( Xbox Live )hadn\\'t played the BETA.The graphics of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare are simply stunning to look at, with a strong framerate of around 60-70 FPS (Frames Per Second) it makes the game feel as well as look the part of a true battleground. Since CoD4 has such a strong framerate you may come back to such games as Rainbow Six Vegas and think, \"Wow, why is the FPS so low?!\" Some people however may aruge that CoD4 looks slightly cartoonyish... I think this is because they have played such games as Crysis on full spec. The I.W. 3 Engine does a truly remarkable job of presenting the game in huge graphical detail in both SP and MP.The sound of Call of Duty 4 is at the same level as the graphics, you can tell that I.W. spent alot of money on getting all the sounds for the guns just right. Also the voice acting in the SP is outstanding, making you feel for the characters throughout the storyline until the end. I played Call of Duty 4 on a 5.1 surround sound system and too say the least, I am blown away!The storyline of Call of Duty 4 is short but great too play. I played the game first time on Veteran difficulty and too say the least, I felt like chucking my 360 out of the window it was so difficult :) You play as 2 sides, The United States Marine Corp and the British S.A.S. Throughout the SP you will switch between the two sides but most of the story is based around the S.A.S. operative Soap. Overall the storyline could\\'ve been a bit longer on the less harder difficulties but switch it up to Veteran or Hardened difficulty and the game will last you a lot longer.The MP of Call of Duty 4 is very addicting and immersive. With the addition of the leveling system which was featured in Rainbow Six Vegas and Perks, players will always be competing for the highest rank. And too make sure the MP lasts you for a long time, I.F. have stuck in the \"Prestige Mode\" feature. When you have hit level 55 (Top Level) you have the choice of going through Prestige Mode. Prestige Mode wil set your level back to 1 and all your equipment and perks etc. will be gone. Now, there is a rumor surrounding the 10 times you must go around prestige mode, when you hit level 55 you would expect to unlock everything right? Wrong. There are 2 perks which are still unlockable, the rumor is once you have completed every challenge and gone round 10 times in Prestige you will unlock these perks.Overall Call of Duty 4 has set the bar for Online FPS games, and it is a definate purcahse for people who have access to XBL.',\n",

       "  'description': \"New Super Mario Bros. brings Mario away from 3D worlds and into the classic formula of side-scrolling. If you've played previous Mario side-scrollers, you'll probably be thinking this is all of the same - you're wrong. New Super Mario Bros. refreshes the Mario series and brings it up to date with a bang.There are a total of eight worlds in the game but you can finish the game by taking secret short cuts and only completing six worlds. You'll obviously want to go back and play the final two worlds if only for the fact to see the stunning level designs. The main worlds are split up into different levels and you direct Mario to which level you want to play and then select it. Along the way there are also optional 'toll gates' in which you can pay five stars to access more levels or to enter a mushroom house which will give you a new power-up or lives. The level select world is simple yet effective and as it is one of the first things you'll see, you get the feeling this is going to be a great game.The levels are designed fantastically. You can get undersea levels, ice levels, desert levels, grass levels... there are plenty of different styles so you won't get bored of the landscapes at all. Mario of course comes with his basic moves and power-ups, but there are new ones chucked in to make things a little different. Mario is controlled by the D-Pad and he can jump, butt slam on enemy's heads, wall jump and so on. Mario's power-ups feature things such as the fireball, mega mushroom which sees you turning massive and stomping your way through the level for a limited time, mini mushroom which makes you tiny and allows you to access areas you couldn't previously, along with all the usual power-ups.A downside to New Super Mario Bros. is the fact that it is incredibly short and you get the feeling it is over too quickly. Saying this though, there are a few levels that will have you frustrated as you keep dying at the same point over and over. There are mini-games such as those included in Super Mario 64 DS but these don't add much to the games total game time, nor does the multiplayer feature which sees you collecting stars against your opponent. Luckily, there are three stars to collect in each level and some people may want to go back and collect all of the stars which adds a lot of play time to the game.New Super Mario Bros. is a definite hit and no DS owner can go without this game. People who may have been around when the first Mario Bros. came out will still enjoy this game as much as people who have never played a side-scrolling Mario. A real thrill all round.\",\n",

Frontlines is one of those games that you love because it offers an experience you can\\'t get anywhere else on a console. When I first sat down with Frontlines I honestly wasn\\'t sure what to expect, I had played very little of the Battlefield series so I wasn\\'t sure if I would even like the game style. However when I began playing the single player portion of Frontlines it quickly came to me that that this is a game that values how the player looks at a situation. In the first mission your character, Mr. Western \"Good Guy\" Capitalist, helicopter is shot down and you must scramble around the map capturing \"control points\" to push back the other teams frontline. Now that is basically the outline of the games formula, you go to area, you kill people in that area, and you capture area. As bland as that sounds it works, I don\\'t know why but it does. The game tries hard to be cinematic and throw as many \"Holy crap what was that!\" moments at you and it does it with reasonable succes. The single player really shines when it gives you multiple ways to do a given objective. During one mission I had to clear a house, now my original intention was to go in with my squad and fight room-to-room, however I instead began launching remote control drones into the house and taking out the baddies from the safety of a control point, that was awesome. So to sum things up Fronlines offers a decent single player game that has a compelling story and solid game play. Now it\\'s time for some multiplayer! Frontlines transfers that compelling single-player game and replaces all those bots with real people, up to 50 people. Now as awesome as that sounds there are a few problems. 1) Lag, with up to 50 people in a game some matches have a severe case of 30-seconds-ago. 2) The game has no true penalty for people who don\\'t play as a team, therefore eliminating some of the strategy. 3)Deploying..., after accepting your class, specialty, and spawn-point, you are given a bleak \"Deploying...\" screen that takes up the screen until you spawn.',\n",

The cover system takes a little getting used to, but it works very well, by the end it was rare for me to end up in a spot I didn't want to be in. My problem is that I wasn't huge on the pacing, there wasn't much of a rise and fall in action. There were quieter moments and slightly bigger scenes, but it seemed to have an intensity level a little too consistent.

The customization is very similar to The Elder Scrolls IV : Oblivion, as it goes into so much depth almost any character that a player creates will be unique. Even though I know this is a great feature, I found it somewhat over-whelming. During the customization you select your characters backstory, this ranges from: Earth Civillian, Colonial Survivor or A Descendant of former Militarians. You also can select the kind of person your character is, A Cruel Tyrant, A War Hero or A Survivor. These minor backstories won't affect the game much, but will influence dialog which is spoken in the game.The story in Mass Effect is based around a huge universe, which players must travel across to find information and complete missions in order to advance the story. Getting around from planet to planet is done without much hassle, as it's automated which means no annoying Zelda-like boat trips... It is a huge story with lots of mini backstories for you to explore as well, which means you will get many, many hours of gameplay.]The gameplay of Mass Effect is at a par, due to the fact of it's slightly broken combat.It has used the style of Rainbow Six : Vegas' cover system, although this does spice up the combat, it just doesn't feel as intense as say Call of Duty 4's combat. However the interaction between characters and the environment is great, and this almost but not quite saves Mass Effect's gameplay.Sound-wise Mass Effect sounds great. The sound of ship engines roaring or rifles firing, and the composition of music. All contribute to make the game feel alot more life-like.Graphically, Mass Effect looks spectacular however it is hindered by some graphical glitches. At some points during conversations with other characters their eyes would go skewed and the shadows would fall over the face unrealisticly. However looking at the detail of the ships and environments around you is spectacular.Overall Mass Effect is a very in-depth RPG and is one not to be missed by RPG fans. This game is definately worth the money, as it is beautiful to listen see and play. And with over 100+ hours of gameplay minimum you will be playing this game for a very long time.\",\n",

Kid plans on replacing cow’s milk with goat's milk and there is only one person, or fox, that can save the day.You play the game as Spy Fox, controlling him with your mouse only. You must speak to people around the Greek island of Acidophilus in hope of finding a way to stop Kid's plans. Along the way you will be using special gadgets given to you by Professor Quack such as putty that copies paper or a toothbrush that really destroys metal.The artistic style of the game is beautiful and is drawn in a really unique way, which complements the brilliant game play. Due to the cartoony way the game is drawn the graphics do not look dated at all (bar the fact if you have a high resolution monitor it'll be stretched out) and you wouldn't be able to guess this was made way back in 1997.The voice acting is superb, especially Spy Fox. When Mr. Udderly is telling the story of his capture you will be laughing your head off as he talks about how he fights off his kidnappers or when you beat smug Mr. BigPig in a game of Go Fish.As mentioned just then, there are a number of side games. Go Fish is the best one as you play against Mr. BigPig who starts sweating and panicking when you have more sets than him. There is also a small easel with paper on which you can use to draw on. Finally there is Happy Fun Sub which can be accessed from Spy Fox's watch. In this game you control the Spycraft, collecting things like satellites, buoys, and submersibles.Spy Fox in Dry Cereals also has alternative routes to play the game, meaning you'd have to play the game at least three times through to cover all the different changes in the storyline and the different weapons you use - this is a genius feature and it'll really make you want to go back and play again.Humongous Entertainment really didn't get enough credit for this game as they perhaps should have. Although meant to be a kid’s game, older gamers really could get some sneaky enjoyment out of this brilliant gaming experience.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Devil May Cry 4 is an action-packed beat em up game by Capcom for the Playstaion  3 and Xbox 360. The PS3 version utilizes the power of blu-ray and HDD space as  it is uploaded to the hard drive. The major downside to the game is the install  time as you will probably be waiting about 25 minutes for it to complete before  you can begin and will become tired of the main theme song when you finally do  start. Other than that, the game is simply breathe taking.It features  Nero, a new protagonist in the series, as well as the charismatic son of Sparta  Dante. You begin as Nero who with the power of his demonic arm, is assigned to  find and confront the mysterious Dante by the religious sect The Order of the  Sword. Throughout the first few levels Nero begins to discover some hidden  motives by the organization and eventually learns their true agenda. Along the  way Dante tells Nero that the organization cannot be trusted and that his  possible suspicions could be accurate. But can he be trusted? Of course he can!  Nero then determines whom his true foe is once someone whom he values most  dearly is abducted. Without going into detail half way through the game you  control Dante and continue with the main story arc. Throughout your  adventure you gain certain color-coded orbs to purchase special moves and items  to help you dispose of foes with ease. The moves that Nero and Dante pull off  are absolutely amazing and animated very well as there is no dip in frame rate  at all. You will perform acrobatic, sword-slashing, gun-toting, demon-possessed  moves and will not be disappointed. Graphically the game looks great as facial  animations and environments are modeled really well. Character models will not  disappoint as the Bosses are huge (making battles feel epic), Nero and Dante are  fluid with all their movements and the fem fatale will catch everybody's eye (to  say the least).The audio leaves a little more to be desired, but this  has always been common to the series. Every time a foe is present you'll begin to  hear the same battle-themed rock music and know it's time to decapitate  somebody. The gameplay mechanics are sound as you will pull off all moves at  your disposal easily and with little to no trouble at all. There are two  difficulty settings (human and devil hunter) and can complete the game within 11  hours.DMC4 is a good follow up to DMC3 and will provide for difficult  moments, but not to the point where you're ready to throw the game out the  window. It's leagues better than DMC2 but not as good as the original (which is  common for most things). If you enjoyed any of the first three installments or  like pulling of stylish combo moves that are great to look at, then I strongly  recommend Devil May Cry 4. \",\n",

       "  'description': 'Long held as a stalwart on the PC, Sid Meier\\'s long-running Civilization series has never had a true and faithful built for consoles version.\\xa0 That is *dramatic pause* until now!\\xa0 Yes, built from the ground up, Firaxis and it\\'s head man Sid Meier bring to PS3 and Xbox 360 the incredibly stream-lined Civilization Revolution.\\xa0 Though fans of the PC games may not see much reason to delve into a seemingly stripped down version of the complex series, those who have never played a Civ game, or those just looking for a fun and fast-playing strategy game would do good to throw their support behind this revolution. In a nutshell, think of the Civilization as a very complex tabletop board game.\\xa0 There is no true campaign for single-player, but each \"game\" is considered a random conflict in and of itself.\\xa0 Other than that, one player options include a list of scenarios or the \"Game of the Week\", a specially designed map that will post your results on a Firaxis leader board to show your mastery of the game to all who will dare look.\\xa0 There are also online matches that pit four Civ players against one another on a randomized map, but these seem to suffer from some of the \"long deliberations\" that can come with this type of turn-based strategy game.\\xa0 Though the single-player may seem a bit stunted, it begs to be played again and again.\\xa0 The strength of this franchise seems to be, and continues to be, it\\'s addicting gameplay. Like was mentioned before, the gameplay revolves around a turn-based almost board game-like style of play.\\xa0 You\\'ll begin each map choosing one of 16 \"Civs\" to play as, each with unique talents and units to help you on your way to one of the game\\'s four methods of victory.\\xa0 Once in the game, you\\'ll be taking turns building cities, forming armies, attacking/negotiating with other Civs, developing technology, and basically doing anything that\\'ll move your chosen Civ towards a victory against the others inhabiting the map.\\xa0 This can be done Technologically buy building a space vessel to find the world of Alpha Centauri, Culturally by gathering 20 great people, converted cities, and World Wonders and building the UN, Domination-wise by simply capturing all the other Civs capitals, and Economically by gathering 20,000 in gold revenues and building the World Bank.  With all these options for victory and the different Civs to play as, the game might have a boost in replay value, but it also has a considerable learning curve for those unfamiliar with this type of gameplay.\\xa0 It\\'s nothing too severe, and certainly this is the easiest Civ game available.\\xa0 Still, it is there, and it can turn off some gamers before they even get into the good meat of the game. As for the visuals, the cartoonish style definitely makes up for the lack of polygons here and there.\\xa0 Leaders and advisors that pop into the foreground during gameplay are nicely detailed and animate great, and the troop battles and city building are definitely a joy to watch, but a few textures here and there seem to be poorly detailed, especially on the map itself.\\xa0 The vibrant colors used certainly help mask it a bit, but for the most part, some of the mountains and unique map resources could have used a bit more detail. As for the sound design, the score used within is definitely fun, simple, yet manages to be stirring and complex in places.\\xa0 It\\'s certainly the highlight of the sound design, along with battle effects.\\xa0 However, something that\\'s a love it or hate it issue is the \"babble\" that both advisors and leaders speak.\\xa0 I find it personally amusing, but others might think otherwise. Civ Rev isn\\'t a game that\\'ll appeal to all audiences, which might be the reason that it hasn\\'t been on consoles in so long.\\xa0 However, if you\\'ve ever wanted to run one of the great Civs from the stone age to the space age and clash in some strategic warfare, Civilization Revolution might be right up alley.',\n",

The simple use of textures on creatures to walls make you feel as though, you were actually there. The design DK uses helps set the humourous side of the game, it will make you chuckle when you see an imp runnning away from an enemy giant! 10/10Gameplay: Is great fun, you can literally just have fun clicking on a wall and watch your imps dig for you! Training creatures, mining gold, researching spells it\\'s all a huge pile of fun fun. There are also many other things you can do in Dugeon Keeper 2, but I won\\'t give out spoilers! The game difficulty is just right, apart from one level where it just leaps up like a frog on steroids, and then comes down again to where it once came. (I think it\\'s mission 14) 9.5/10Sound: Fantastic, it sets the mood just right for an underground smelly, dark and dank dungeon in which you have control over. Hearing the occasional drop of water, padding of creature\\'s feet or even the farts of a Bile Demon all give the game great sound. Also the helper, (Horny) , has a rather good taste in black humour and as well as keeping you informed, he will also keep you entertained with his heart warming jokes.Story: It\\'s quite basic but gets to the point very well. Simplicity in the story allows you to have more fun, then having to keep on remembering things and then associating them with whats happening now. However some people may want a more complex story, than DK2 has to offer. 8.5/10Overall, Dungeon Keeper 2 in my opinion, is possibly the best and most unique RTS to date. Pick up a copy if you ever see one. This game gets my \"MUST BUY!\" ',\n",

Johnny Klebitz, VP of The Lost The Lost and Damned stars Johnny Klebitz, the Vice-President of a Liberty  City biker gang, The Lost.\\xa0 The story picks up when the president of the gang, Bill y, is released from therapy and is ready to stir up some trouble.\\xa0 However, Johnny has star  ted leaning towards this silly little feeling called \"maturity\" and is un willing to simply go in guns blazing for everything.\\xa0 Billy plays the \"Lost Brothers forever!\" card on Johnny to make him follow Billy, and the story and the gang itself unravels from there.\\xa0 Overall, it seems like the whole gang is kind of washed up and tired, as shown by the frustation that is caused by the in-gang fighting and the talk of starting a family or slowing down.\\xa0 The story, while not being  as deep as Niko Bellic\\'s tale, is still very interesting and fun to play through.\\xa0 While Johnny  is smart and makes wise desicions, there is something about him that just doesn\\'t make him that likeable.\\xa0 He doesn\\'t have much of an interesting history, and the story is not as fun as a deep tale of vengence and revenge.\\xa0 Either way, Rockstar\\'s hilarious, fun, but deep way of storytelling is evident throughtout the whole game and is fun from start to finish.In addition to the new story and characters, there is a new central hub,\\xa0 The Lost clubhouse.\\xa0 This acts as your apartment like in GTA IV, complete with a stripper, bar, pool table, arm wrestling matches, and a poker table with people playing a Johnny riding with his Hexorlittle Hi-Low.\\xa0 Along with these new activites, there are more races and gang wars.\\xa0 Races are straight out of Road Rash and could not be more fun.\\xa0 The races are now raced on only motorcylces and everyone is equipped with baseball bats.\\xa0 Now, for some people who have played GTA IV and shudder at the words \"motorcycle races\" and are reminded of GTA IV\\'s not so great motorcylce handling, fear not.\\xa0 The bikes now have improved handling and control much smoother than GTA IV\\'s bikes.\\xa0 Along with the super-fun new races, some brand new shiny bikes have been added.\\xa0 One of the new bikes is Johnny\\'s special Hexor.\\xa0 It\\'s a chopper that is always at The Lost clubhouse and can be delivered by calling Clay, along with any other bikes you have found.\\xa0 All in all, there are a whopping 18 new motorcycles added to the game.Along with the new motorcycles, the aresnal of weapons has increased.\\xa0 The 6 new weapons, including a gernade launcher, double barrel shotgun, automatic pistol, and (my favorite) the combat shotgun.\\xa0 Just like in GTA IV, all guns will be available by calling up a friend and can be purchased in the back a van.\\xa0 While all the original guns and weapons are still able to be used, these new weapons add to the unique, gritty personality of the Lost and Damned.There are a handful of new competitive multiplayer modes in TLAD as well.\\xa0 Included in these modes are Witness Protection, Chopper vs. Chopper, Lone Wolf Biker, and updated motorcycle race modes.\\xa0 Witness protection involves one team being the cops and one team being The Lost.\\xa0 The cops are trying to protect the witness bus while the Lost are simply trying to blow up the armored bus.\\xa0 Chopper vs. Chopper is a fun and interesting mode.\\xa0 One person is on a motorcyle passing checkpoints throughout Liberty City, while another person is in an attack helicopter that is trying to take down the person on the motorcycle.\\xa0 Lone Wolf Biker involves one poor sap as a biker while everyone is simply trying to take down the biker.\\xa0 The race mode is now all motorcycle races, not to mention that everyone has baseball bats.\\xa0 The Lost and Damned could probably be sold as an entirely brand new packaged game.\\xa0 The story probably take anyone from 10-12 hours, and that\\'s without doing gang wars or any other side missions.\\xa0 In addition to a new story, new guns, motorycles, characters, side missions, and multiplayer modes are all included into one, simple $20 download pack.\\xa0 Rockstar has changed the definition of DLC.\\xa0 While most DLC is simply a couple new missions, cars, or maps, Rockstar went all out and completly expanded on a game that was already without faults.\\xa0 Either way, TLAD is quite the enjoyable ride for newcomers and veterans of GTA IV.KA-BOOOOM!',\n",

       "  'description': \"Animal Crossing: Wild World will have you in many different stages throughout its lifetime. First you will have to make the leap to buy the game after getting over the fact the game looks a tad childish, you'll then put the cartridge in and play for hours thinking this is the best game ever. Finally, after about a year or so, you'll realise the game is getting a tad tedious and a chore to play.At the start of the game you are riding in a taxi and the driver is questioning you on things such as your gender and what you want your town name to be called. It's a nice introduction which really captures the character of the game and gives you a nice first impression. You will then be dropped off in your town. Everyone's town is different (although they all have the same buildings), right down to the placing of the trees and your house - this is great as when you visit other towns you don't get bored of the repetition.So, you have your town and your character. Now what? First you will be hired by Tom Nook, the local shopkeeper, to do a few tasks such as delivering packages. Once you have done these he will build your house which can be upgraded every time you pay off your ever increasing loan. Tom Nook's store starts of as a cheap shack and finally, after shopping there a lot, turns into a grand supermarket. In Tom Nook's store you can buy furniture for your house (and put it wherever you want) and buy tools such as spades and bug nets.In the game you can catch bugs which change depending on the season or you can go dig up fossils to either sell at the store for Bells (the town's currency) or donate to the museum in hope of collecting them all. The town will change daylight and season to match that of the settings in your DS. If it is winter in real life, you will see snow on the floor of your town that you can roll up and make a big snowman!You are not the only person in the town. There are about seven other people living in your town (excluding people in the public buildings such as Tom Nook) that you can interact with and talk to. You can send them presents on their birthday or be really mean to them so they move town. You can receive mail from these 'friends' although most of the stuff they send you is really random, although funny.The game also has some nice features such as being able to make your own star constellations or going down to the museum's cafe and listening to KK Slider's songs with a mug of coffee, which you can take home and play in your house's CD player. Your house will also get rated from time to time depending on your collection of furniture.A main attraction of Animal Crossing: Wild World is the fact you can take it online and visit your friend's towns. This may seem good on paper, but in reality all you can do is go to their shops and houses, steal their fruit that grows on the trees and chat to them. There are no special Wi-Fi games built in, unless you feel imaginative enough to make up your own - but then there are no official rules set in place stopping people cheating. Wild World online is a bit of a letdown in some places, but it can be good for a while.Graphically the game is good for the DS but it isn't showing off what the DS can really do. The sound isn't exactly stunning and it just limited to the typical tunes of the DS, so don't expect a bestselling soundtrack coming out any time soon.The main letdown of the game is a big one. After a while catching bugs and fish won’t seem as fun as it used to and catching up with all your friends around the town will seem like another thing to add to your long list of daily, repetitive chores. It really is a fun game while it lasts and you should still buy it, but some people may find it gathering dust on their shelves after a year or so.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"I wasn't sure about this one for a lot of the time I was playing it. Most of the new gameplay features add depth but detract from the fun, in my opinion. Limited inventory space, having to use camoflage, feed yourself, and mend your wounds and breaks sounds cool and realistic, but it just adds a ton of menu navigation to the normal gameplay experience. I don't think it really enhanced my experience needing to change my uniform when I move from the jungle to the inside of a building or click on a few different items to stop me from bleeding away any more health in a tight spot.I was also concerned about the story, I was one of many who was fed up by the direction MGS2's story went by the end, but since then I've come to appreciate it more, and MGS3's tale didn't seem as twisty and interesting, perhaps in response to that backlash. MGS3 has more of a focus on character and emotion than political quadruple-crosses, and ends up being the most satisfying and best story in the series, in my opinion. And let's be honest here, thanks to the series' deep but increasingly dated and clumsy gameplay engine, the story is why we play Metal Gear. I don't have to tell you the visuals are amazing, and the sound is quite good too, well acted as always, and with some good music and maybe the best use of a classic theme I've ever seen near the end.Subsistence also has some great special features, especially the inclusion of the first two games from the MSX (this being the first time MG2 is available legally in the US) and the hilarious Secret Theater.\",\n",

I did not play the game once it had arrived, I merely placed into the disc drive to see if it worked. After 1000 gamerscoring Cod4, I was looking at my games collection to see what SP game to play next. And so I chose Blue Dragon.The beginning of the game began very slowly, like an astmathic old lady with some heavy shopping, after about 20-30 minutes or so I gained the power of my shadows. After that the game started to get good, using all the powers of the elements with my characters was very cool. Also the game is 3 discs long so it has quite a long storyline, I have yet to finish the game so I do not know if I am satisfied with the story.The character design of the N/PCs, (Non/Playable Characters), were done by the famous Akira Toriyama, who is known for his work in the Dragonball series. The NPCs such as creatures and merchants are very unique and add to the weirdness and wonderful to look at visuals, that Blue Dragon has. However the character designs seem to have almost jumped from DBZ, Shu looks like Teen Gohan, Kluke looks like a young Bulma and Marumaro looks like the pig (can\\'t remember his name). The graphic style of Blue Dragon is pleasent to look at and suits the style of gameplay very well.The music is probably one of the most stunning points of Blue Dragon, composed by the famous FF composer, Nobuo Uematso. You cannot help but love this music, it\\'s even better than the end of portal \"Still Alive\" song. The music sets the mood well and can be enjoyed by many ages. The voice acting for the English translation jumps from awful to above mediocre during the story. GET SOME REAL ACTORS TO DO VOICE OVERS FOR JAPANESE RPGS AND ANIME, heck get the guys from FF to send some actors over.The gameplay itself is fun, but can get annoying at times. I have not been much of a fan of turn-based games, but Blue Dragon is an exception, the animation and uniqueness of each creature or characters spells or special abilities, make up for the FF gameplay which Blue Dragon uses.Overall Blue Dragon is a fun game which can be enjoyed by most ages.',\n",

       "  'description': \"In late 2007, Sony's PS3 was still lagging way behind Microsoft and Nintendo in terms of both sales and good games. Naughty Dog's Uncharted: Drake's Fortune looked to turn that around and deliver PS3 owners with a cinematic yarn that delivered the goods like a big summer blockbuster. Luckily, what they set out to do was successful and their game turned out to be one of the best PS3 games of 2007. The first thing that pops out at you (no pun intended), is the beautiful look of the game. While the graphics are hurt somewhat by the pop-in problems, the game still stands out as one of the best looking on the system. The bright, jungle environments are a relief and are quite refreshing, seeing as most games' color palate consists of about three colors: brown, green, and gray. The environments don't get repetitive thanks to slight variations in the landscape, such as including castle, ruin, and cave levels. The game can look great, but if it don't play well then there's no reason to play it. Uncharted, plays great, so there are no worries. If you want an idea of the controls, think of Gears of War in a jungle. You are allowed to carry two weapons, one large and one smaller, along with grenades. You use the circle button to latch onto cover. From there you can peak out and shoot the tons of dudes that are there to kill you. There are also some driving levels, along with one or two on a jetski (which has become the butt of many jokes), but I think these additions help round out the game. There are a few problems, however, as the camera can get in the way of things, as well as the platforming elements being a bit frustrating, as judging your next landing can be a little screwy. The gameplay delivers pretty much what you'd expect, but if it weren't for the story, this would just be a decent adventure game. The story really drives you to finish the game, which isn't that short, but not that long either. The characters, including protagonist Nathan Drake, are some of the best and most lovable in video game history. As I said before, the story plays out much like a summer blockbuster and is paced in just that way. Towards the end of the game, the players are thrown an amazing twist that is only hinted at in the beginning. It's coupled with a new gameplay style that may seem a little weird at first, but it works perfectly in shocking the gamer. Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is a damn good game, one that I would recommend to any PS3 owner who hasn't touched it yet. Whether you rent it or buy it, you won't be disappointed. \",\n",

You compete against seven other computer-controlled racers in two separate Grand Prixs, each consisting of four cups, and each cup consisting of four tracks. That's thirty two tracks in total. The first Grand Prix, Nitro GP, has sixteen never-before-seen tracks while Retro GP contains sixteen tracks seen before in previous Mario Kart instalments. There are three difficulty classes to pick from: 50cc, 100cc and 150cc. You can also unlock a 150cc mirror mode which, hence the name, mirrors the tracks and makes it that bit harder. When you complete a cup you get awarded a trophy based on how well you did. Scoring high in the cups can unlock new characters and karts.A second mode is entitled Battle Mode which is split into two different games: Balloon Battle and Shine Runners. In Balloon Battle the main objective is to knock out other players by popping their balloons (hitting them with a weapon) or stealing them for yourself (mushroom at them). This game makes use of the DS' microphone as you have to blow into it to make your balloons inflate. Shine Runners has you trying to collect the most amount of shines from around the course or stealing them from other players, in hope of becoming the player with the most shines at the end of the round. Both of these games feature five unique courses not seen in the Grand Prix.There is also a mission mode which has you completing missions such as going through the gates in order or picking up all the coins. When you complete each mission it will rate how well you did out of three (stars). If you get one star or more on each mission it will unlock six more, previously hidden missions. Time Trial mode also features which is just you racing alone trying to beat the best time set on that course.Obviously the DS has two screens and Mario Kart makes good use of both. The top screen shows the race in full 3D. The graphics are some of the best on the DS, which is always a good thing. The bottom screen shows the whole course (birds-eye view, 2D) and where everyone is on it or you can change the display to show a close up (still birds-eye view and in 2D) of your player and the weapons and course nearby.A big part of Mario Kart is the weapons and the DS version doesn't disappoint. There is the banana skin that you can fire and try and make another racer slip up on it, the red shell which you can fire to take out the person in front of you, the blue shell which takes out the person in first place, Bullet Bill which turns you into just that and gives you a limited time to race around as him, knocking people out of your path.... the list goes on. The weapons are picked up in question mark boxes and whatever weapon you get depends on your characters stats and your position in the race.There are thirteen characters in the game, three of them new the series. All the usual characters return such as Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi and so on. Three new characters are Dry Bones, R.O.B. and Shy Guy (who is only playable via DS Download Play). Daisy, Waluigi, Dry Bones and R.O.B. have to be unlocked, however.As mentioned earlier, Mario Kart DS is the first of the series to have online capabilities. If you are with up to eight mates you can play all the courses in the game or you can race on eight tracks using DS Download Play if some people don't have the cartridge. Sadly, the eight tracks aren't the best ones of the game and you'll be happier if everyone has the game.If you aren't with any of your friends, you can play via the Wi-Fi connection. Up to four players can play at once on twenty of the tracks (some aren't playable due to high animation, which is a shame) and you will get awarded with a win or loss after each race. The game hardly, if ever, lags which gives you great, seamless kart racing experience! Mario Kart DS is easily the best Mario Kart so far due to the fact it has online play, new weapons and characters and the fact it is just downright fun. A must-have for all DS owners, whatever the gender or age.\",\n",

       "  'description': \" After Call of Duty 2, Infinity Ward handed Call of Duty 3 over to a different publisher Treyarch which did a decent job. After awhile, they announced they are ditching the World War 2 story and going Modern and what a great choice. Now Infinity Ward has released there next game Call of Duty 4 and may have been the best game of 2007.   Throughout Call of Duty 4's story you will go through many exciting battles. Sometimes you will be with a squad of soldiers and sometimes just one other teammate. The game will change things up in about every mission. Some missions rely on stealth and sniping. Some others involve you in a plane shooting enemies below to help your men. The game has many different missions and give's you more option's then the previous games.  The Campaign mostly has you saving the world from a nuclear war. You will fight and stop the missile and more to save the world. The interaction with you and your squad is amazing and the allies of your have very good AI and aren't stupid and know what to do. They will even warn you to duck and they will help you take down a target or take the target down themselves. The Downside to the Campaign is that it end's. The story of this game is super short and can be beaten in less than 5 hours.   The Story has very great gunplay but the game has very cinematic and movie like cutscenes. The game feel's like a superb movie basically with real great gameplay.  The Weapons have improved greatly from the last games in the series. You Have Assault Rifles, LMG's, Sniper's, Shotgun's, and many more. You can man a turrent to knock out the enemies ever faster. You can play some Claymores and C4's to take your enemies down without a approach.   After beating the game, you may ask, now what? Well now you can play COD4's amazingly great online multiplayer mode. The best thing may be in this game you rank up by getting XP which is experience points. This is a great thing for a online game, you feel like you actully play the game and earn stuff. You feel like you never wasted your time. The Online Multiplayer may be the greatest thing in this game.  You earn XP by killing an enemy and unlocking and doing challenges. You can rank up to level 55 which is Commander. You may think It's all over there, well it's not, You can go onto Prestige and earn yourself a nice shiny badge. You can go on Prestige for a total of 10 times and this is a way to keep you hooked to the superb multiplayer this game hold's in store for you.  There's many game modes for you to chose from. I'll List a Few to show you what I mean.  Team Deathmatch: Eliminate the other team. Domination: Capture Flag's A, B, and C and Defend them from enemies. Sabotage: Fight the other team for the bomb to plant it. Search and Destroy: Plant the Bomb and defend the bomb and eliminate enemy players. (No Respawn's)  Ground War: Huge Team's, Mixture of game types. Team Tactical: Random Game Type. Kill Other Team. Old School Free For All: Pick up your weapons, no custom classes and kill everyone. Free For All: Kill Everyone  As you see, In Call of Duty 4 you alway's have a wide and big choice on what to do. In all these mode's, making it a great online game.  Overall, this game is very much the best game in the series. It's rewarding and fun and will keep you coming back. Infinity Ward has done a amazing job at making this game and you can see all the effort. Making one of the best games of 2007. It's 2009 and I still play the Multiplayer, 2 years, now that is long lasting!    \",\n",

       "  'description': \"If you have a PS2 and don't play Okami, you're a bad person. It's simply a fantastic game. The graphics are stunning - I don't care about the GE Force 8800 or the new current generation of high definition systems, Okami is the best looking game I've seen, thanks to the great art style and amazing cel-shading technology that makes it look like a living watercolor painting. This is an opinion of course, if you'd rather look at super high-def ruins in Gears of War, that's just fine. The game also has great music, although I can't say all the audio is good. Okami's main flaw is the voice acting - it's text based, and instead of silence or some beeps, you get garbled snippets of voice (like Banjo-Kazooie) that's tolerable at first but gets very annoying after long bouts of extended exposition.It's not just great because of its aesthetic qualities though, it IS a video game, and a good one. I can say without doubt it is the best Zelda-style action adventure that isn't actually a Zelda game I've played. It's easy, but still fun, thanks to the Celestial Brush, which you use to draw your special attacks and tools instead of having to sort through an inventory. The different brush powers are all easy to learn and remember, and they give Okami a unique flair to the traditional exploring and combat. The dungeons are more focused on using your powers to advance forward, the puzzles are less Zelda-style solving something to open a door and more using your techniques and platforming skills to reach that door. The combat is a little simple, but still cool thanks to slick attacks, a variety of weapons, the use of the brush techniques, and interesting enemy design.The story should also be mentioned, I wasn't expecting a lot, but it's actually quite good. The character development is great and there are some cool twists and turns, and it's all enriched by the Japanese mythology that surrounds it. Overall, Okami is a cohesive, beautiful work of art and it's a damn shame no one is playing it.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'The first \"true\" sequel to the revelutionary Grand Theft Auto III, GTA IV throws gamers back into the crime-ridden streets of Liberty City for another spree of sex, violence, humor, and drama.\\xa0 However, the only thing gamers will recognize from the original GTA III is the same signature free-roaming sand box gameplay that put Rockstar\\'s game franchise on the map.\\xa0 Though things have been added, its what GTA IV removes from the picture of past experiences, the way it streamlines gameplay and adds the smallest fiber of detail to create a living city combined with a superbly written story that makes GTA IV a near perfect experience from top to bottom. The story this time around puts you in the shoes of slavic refugee Niko Bellic.\\xa0 Now Niko has gotten in some trouble in his east European home, his role in the Bosnian War leaving him a shell of a man forced to criminal activity to just make ends meet.\\xa0 When Niko gets in a bit of trouble, he decides to make a break for US shores, and what better place to make port than Liberty City, where his cousin Roman has reportedly hit it rich and is living in a mansion with fast cars and loose women.\\xa0 However, once reaching dry land, the picture starts to unravel for Niko, discovering Roman\\'s legendary bullshit skills are still as keen as ever.\\xa0 Roman is in debt, his mansion is a crappy Broker (Liberty City\\'s analogue for Brooklyn) apartment, the fast cars are cabs that Roman drives, and the loose women are only really loose for pay.\\xa0 Still, Niko loves his cousin and has a few more agendas in Liberty City than he lets on at first, so he sets out to just make a living in this strange land.\\xa0 The story escalates into a crime drama of revenge, memorable characters, and even more memorable story scenes that really satirize the idea of the American Dream as nothing more than a selfish culture of consumerism and sin.\\xa0 Powerful stuff.  But that all doesn\\'t mean shit if the game plays... well... like shit.\\xa0 Ok ok, maybe even if the game wasn\\'t the greatest triumph of the series, the story would still be worth checking out.\\xa0 Luckily, this year\\'s installment IS the pinnacle of GTA\\'s playability, taking the classic formula, stripping away all unecessary mechanics and adding new ones that either help immensely or at the very least, do not hinder.\\xa0 Anyone unfamiliar with the franchise, the biggest boon to GTA\\'s popularity was its freedom of gameplay.\\xa0 You are dropped into a living city where there are a number of missions and activities that you CAN take part in to advance the story or boost your in-game fundage, but that has never been necessary for you to do to enjoy the Grand Theft Auto experience, as it is open to freestyle gameplay.\\xa0 The majority of this gameplay has always been driven by well... driving, and this year\\'s driving might be the most realistic of the series, with vehicle physics being most impressive as you zip around the streets of the huge five burroughed Liberty City.\\xa0 Where once the shooting was one of the weakest elements of the game, this year\\'s installment sees a revamp that adds not only a cover system to make your protagonist a much more deadly fighting force, but also a new targeting system that not only supports lock on targeting, but free-aim as well. One of the more interesting additions to the mix this year is that of a veritable \"social life\" for our hero Niko.\\xa0 Throughout the game, you\\'ll meet various characters who will be added to your in-game cell phone.\\xa0 Eventually, you\\'ll be able to call them to just hang out and try out some of the city\\'s activities (darts, bowling, strip clubs, etc.) and if they get to like you enough, they\\'ll even offer you a service on occasion.\\xa0 This adds a brand new element to the game, as you\\'ll have to balance friendships and story progression, or just choose to use these friends as a break from the daily grind of theft and police evasion, and overall, this is perhaps the most surprisingly well-done features of the game.\\xa0 On the minor side, the gym, barber, and diet elements from San Andreas have been removed (though you can still shop for clothes) and you can now use any of Liberty City\\'s public transportations, be they trains or cabs, to zip across the lengthy landscape.  Grand Theft Auto has never been a pretty game, well, that is until this new installment.\\xa0 For once, GTA looks like it belongs with the other games of the current generations library.\\xa0 Though some textures don\\'t exactly hold up to close scrutiny, character models look and animate great and there is just so goddamn much going on at any given time that if the graphical quality of the game sagged a tad (which it can, at least as far as frame-rate and pop in) one couldn\\'t blame it.\\xa0 Overall, the scope of the world with top notch visuals make this easily the most graphically impressive Grand Theft Auto to date. In the end, GTA IV didn\\'t need any kind of critical approval to be one of the biggest games of all time, but it certainly did enough to reinvent and better itself to deserve the reviews it inevitably recieved from critics.',\n",

From it's dynamic story to its' high production values it boils down to the fact that you need to get this game regardless of if you own a ps3 or not. The online isn't as strong as its single player counterpart, mainly to do with the controls not working for an online multiplayer game. However if you treat the online as a third person shooter rather than a tactical game you'll have hours of fun with the game.

       "  'description': \"Being new to the Burnout franchise I went into this latest iteration of the series oblivious as to what to really expect from the title. While an arcade racer in nature, a run of the mill driving experience ala PGR, Forza, Sega Rally or NFS it certainly isn't. A welcome change for a machine not exactly dry on racing titles. The big selling point of this title compared to it's predecessors is its new open world aspect, the same you would find in say a GTA or Driver game.You start driving around the games city, aptly named 'Paradise City' in a shabby wreck of a car. At your own free will you can participate in a significant number of events which are located at every crossroad and junction you pass through. While overwhelming at first, it doesn't take too long for you to acquaint yourself with the city and it's adjoining surroundings. Soon enough you'll be driving from place to place taking various shortcuts you've discovered on your travels just like it was your own local neighbourhood. The events you'll find in Paradise city can vary between straight forward street races, point A-B survival runs with AI cars trying to force you off the road and stunt runs in which the cities natural and artificially placed obstacles or ramps can be used to string together a ludicrous score in the same way you'd link together a combo in the Devil May Cry series by following one outrageous trick after another.  In and out of these events in the games form of a free roam mode named 'freeburn' you're encouraged to crash your other computer controlled rivals off the street into what's termed a 'takedown'. By doing this you're treated to a slow motion scene of the opponents car (or indeed your own if you mess up) flipping over and breaking into a satisfying collection of pieces and wreckage. As an added incentive you also claim this taken down car to boot, adding it to the selection of cars available to drive from various junkyards around the city (which base as your garage). The crashes all happen in real time and don't interrupt the flow of action with various parts and pieces all crumpling ,breaking and shattering themselves realistically and believably. As well as completing the games set events there's also a great deal of exploration to perform in the city. There's finding super jumps which are as the name suggests extreme versions of normal sized jumps and also billboards which usually take experimentation or plain luck to find out how to break by driving or flying straight through them. The cars you drive while fictional in make and design all handle like real life counterparts and all of which look stunning. In no time you'll be able to flat spin, barrel roll off ramps, power-park or perform hand-break turns with quite considerable ease. All the 75 cars available to you come in one of three classes; speed, stunt and aggression. A slight turn of strategy is involved by the player deciding which car is better suited for each event in which they partake. Obviously a stunt car will make racking up a huge combo score easier for a stunt run, but put that same car into a takedown race where all the AI cars are gunning to impale you on the nearest building and it won't survive a mere gentle shunt let alone a head on collision. Fun as the single player experience is the real meat of the game is in it's online mode. It's here that up-to 8 people via XBL can join in the same city and either engage in races, challenge events in which a task is laid out for all the drivers to complete or just simply enjoying cruising around trying to outdo each others scores in various Burnout disciplines such as who can drift the furthest or drive the longest in oncoming traffic. A neat added extra in the multi-player is the inclusion of camera support which will upload a snapshot of yourself following a take-down to your smug assailant as he drives away. It's a very clever and novel way of making use of the 360's so far under-used camera attachment and almost worth a purchase for the feature alone. Despite Burnouts many admirable qualities there is also a handful of bad points along with the good. The camera view while low to give the game a sense of speed can sometimes obscure proceedings and more often than not you'll find yourself wrecking by misjudging a turn or vehicle pass by the smallest of possible margins. The lack of a retry feature on race & time trial events often means you'll have to spend more time driving to and from failed attempts then actually racing itself. While not game breaking it certainly adds a degree of annoyance to making any progress within the game. It could be argued that this forced attempt to make you drive from location to location makes you investigate the route and it's surroundings but I feel it should have been the players choice whether to do this or not.  Another problem is the cars. While some vehicles are obviously better than others during the course of the game, a great deal of them stutter around the mediocre mark with very little difference between any of them. Finally the game's direction indicator can be very hard to follow, especially during a race. Whilst the game encourages you to find your own route to a given location, for the first couple of hours as you're learning the city layout just getting from point A to B can be an exercise in frustration as you constantly over-run turnings that you were supposedly meant to take. The soundtrack is also the usual hash of the EA marketing machine at work with Disturbed and Avril making their umpteenth appearance in a video game. Driving music it certainly isn't. It should be noted that Adam Ant & Faith No More was a welcome (if not bizarre) inclusion however.If you're a fan of driving games but feel after playing Forza for the simulation side and PGR for arcade thrills that there's very else left to choose from in-between. Burnout is defiantly worth a look-in for an altogether different driving experience.  While some aspects of the game could certainly do with some tweaks or alterations to lower the end users annoyance factor, overall it's an enjoyable ride well worth taking a spin. Good: Impressive visuals, novel game-play, longevity, fun multi-player.  Bad: Occasional bad game-play design, repetition, troublesome camera views.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Game Title: Hang OnRelease Date: 1985Developer: Sega (Yu Suzuki)Platform: Sega Master SystemGenre/Type: Motorcycle RacingGame Rating: [IV/V] The winning combination of appealing aesthetics and solid game play make this game a great experience overall… Sega made the move to try and make the dream of the arcade at home experience come true. Their was a considerable number of arcade game conversions made exclusively to the master system as well as other home platforms. The success of these conversions come up with mixed results. However, it works out and works out well with Hang On.Hang On was released in 1986 by Sega of America under its initial design by Yu Suzuki. The game has a simple premise which is to race down a long stretch of open road toward the finish line and get there before time runs out. If you run out of time then your game is over. Getting into high speed crashes and struggling on sharp turns will be the two biggest things that will slow you down.Hang On has three main difficulty settings with the first being the easiest and the third being the most difficult. The first mode is fairly easy going and only has a few sharp turns. The third mode constantly has sharp turns as well as opponents who try to run into you as you attempt to pass them. Having these modes is great for the game because makes the game more accessible to novice and experienced gamers alike. It is just a matter of finding which mode is right for you.Hang On has two main game mechanics to it; the gear changing and the hang on mechanic. Gear changing in Hang On is important not just for achieving top speed, but is also for avoiding crashes on sharp turns. Down shifting to quickly bring your speed down will most likely carry you through tough turns. The title worthy hang on mechanic is needed for weaving in and out between other competitors on turns.As for the music and sound quality, there is no in-game music. The only music there is music on the title screen as well as the victory jingle that plays once you have won a challenge. However, it is not the music that is the memorable part on this game. The sound is essentially where the audio quality is with possibly the best vehicular sound effects in a console video game to date. The game’s overall presentation flourishes with sound of skidding and engines revving. Graphically speaking, the game does not fare well when compared to its arcade counterpart. However that is not meant to imply that the graphics are bad. When compared with other console game it does stand out with its various different environments and give this version of Hang On its own identity. This game pulls some great visuals that are bound to impress.This game manages to do what other arcade game conversions do not achieve. The game play is true enough for arcade goers and the graphical qualities are great as well as the compelling audio. With varying modes and innovative mechanics, any arcade gamer or someone with a home console is bound to enjoy this title.',\n",

       "  'description': 'I recall fondly the days of the N64, and playing the very first Turok: Dinosaur Hunter. In fact, the game may have very well been my first FPS game that I ever played, and despite the foggy visuals and nonexistent story, I enjoyed the heck out of Turok\\'s frenetic shooting and visceral fights with a childhood obsession of mine, Dinosaurs.Now, over a decade later, the beloved franchise, once thought dead, has returned to the next gen consoles in a big big way. Yes, Turok has returned in a well executed manner, full of plenty of ferocious action and tight production values.The story of the game is perhaps the furthest departure from the original series. Here, you\\'ll play as a new \"Son of Stone\" named Joseph Turok, a Native American soldier with a shady past. Apparently, Turok used to be in a ruthless black ops team that went by the name Wolf Pack, whose methods were... less than savory. Long story short, Turok abandons his command and the company leader, Roland Kane, eventually goes rogue, taking his elite team and holing up on a backwater to brew some evil plan involving chemical warfare. The good guys, now using Turok as their insight into Kane\\'s operations, are coming to pick Kane up when their spaceship is shot out of the sky, and the team is either killed or scattered about the planet, which, due to the various experiments taking place there, has a super acclerated eco-system where dinos run wild and giant bugs are all waiting to snap up the unlucky soldiers of Whiskey Company, whose mission has become to simply survive. The story progresses in a nice Hollywood-esque arc that is a combination of Jurassic Park and Predator, and thought not the SMARTEST story, gets the job done well with plenty of action and tough guy moments.As for the presentation and sound, Turok looks and sounds great. The environments are the real star, ranging between sweltering jungles, to futuristic bunkers and claustrophobic caves. The dinos look and animate great, but some awkward transitions can lead to them looking lost from time to time. Player models look appropriately macho and the Unreal engine makes sure everybody flies off appropriately with explosions and blunt force trauma. As for sound, dinosaurs would and weapons sound like you\\'d expect, but the real stellar part of the soundtrack is in the games epic score and the talented voice cast. Turok\\'s voice actor is great, and you\\'ll see stars like Ron Perlman, Timothy Olyphant, and Donnie Wahlberg all provide some spectacular voice and personality to squad members Slade, Cowboy, and Shepherd, and Powers Boothe does an excellent general as Kane himself. \\xa0 As far as gameplay, Turok hits hard in all aspects. Shooting is impactful and satisfying, though their is a conspicuous absense of auto aim, which isn\\'t a problem while you\\'re picking off targets from afar, but can get annoying in close up conflicts. The weapons on hand aren\\'t anything TOO spectacular, but a few are either direct descendents from previous Turok weapons or are expanded to a greater role. You\\'ll get SMGs, shotguns, and RPGs, but you\\'ll also get the series staples Pulse Rifle, and the trusty bow which is funner to use than ever. Overall, these tools all help in getting through the game\\'s treacherous campaign. The dino enemies are great to fight against because of their ferocity and sheer numbers, but human enemies get annoying with cheap tactics and laser guided bullets. Overall, the game has some tense and challenging battles that will literally have you fighting for your life, and the few boss battles in the game are fantastic and over the top.And speaking of over the top, the one weapon I\\'ve failed to mention is the game\\'s knife, which is the single most awesome aspect of the new Turok game. It far surpasses the classic knife in that, it can be used to perform awesome scripted stealth and insta-kills on any enemy up to the size of a raptor, and simply needs for anything bigger than that to be knocked to the floor before you unleash a flurry of stabs to finish them off. The kills all are awesome, and there\\'s just something greatly visceral about sneaking up behind raptor, jumping on it\\'s back and slitting it\\'s throat, or kicking the legs out from a soldier and knifing him in the head before he can get up. It really gives Turok a lot of personality, especially since many of the games sections have you with nothing but the bow and the knife, allowing you to explore Turok\\'s heritage of cold-blooded up-close fighting. It\\'s really something every gamer should experience.Turok\\'s single player campaign is short, but rewarding because of a punishing difficulty. After that, you can replay on higher difficulties, or explore the game\\'s multiplayer suite which includes Co-op. The co-op is a great addition, and although the multiplayer seems pretty rudimentary at first, you\\'ll find some unique modes like \"War Games\", and also, each map has dino inhabitants in them that are basically wild cards who will attack either team and have to be contended with (much like the single player). Also similar to the multiplayer, all the awesome knife kills can be executed on dinos and other players, giving the game a uniquely awesome vicious streak that really just bumps up the fun which is otherwise a standard multiplayer game.Altogether, Turok is a great, if not short and frustrating FPS effort. It\\'s nostalgic effect might not be felt by anyone, but those who are happy to see the dinosaur hunter back will definitely get a kick out of his new adventure. Although the story isn\\'t the best you\\'ll likely see, and the shooting not revolutionary, it\\'s got enough ferocious fun and high production values to keep any FPS fan stabbing dino skulls for the next few months.',\n",

And somehow 3 gang have managed to take over whole islands from the law enforcement. And you have to take 'em back. Even though I vaguley understand the story, it still isn't enough to keep me intrigued. Story 3/10Graphics: An interesting graphics engine, almost cartoony in a way. Which sets the mood a little more, as you seem to come to expect chaos in cartoons. So I think this different look at graphics is good in this case. Explosions look good and generally everything looks good. 8/10Sound: Nothing really stood out. But everything sounds what you'ld expect it to sound like. No ScoreReplay Value: If you haven't maxed out all your skills, then it has some re-play value, but if you don't know anyone with the game it becomes very boring. And there is no point in trying to find all the hidden/agility orbs as that just becomes a pain in the ass. Also street racing is boring. So there isn't much re-play value. 5/10Creativity: It reminds me too much of GTA *spits* except you are law enforcement. The weapons aren't to creative either, except the harpoon gun.However some of the achievements are fairly creatice. 4/10Music: Don't Like R 'N' B or Rap? Then Stay Away From the jukebox. 0/10Overall Crackdown isn't too great, but it's good fun if you know someone with Xbox LIVE and athe game.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"(This review was originally posted on GameSpot.com under the name stevenscott14. It appears here ever-so-slightly edited in order for it to not look like an absolutely unforgivable wall of text) The most creepy thing about my experience with F.E.A.R. wasn't even the silence, the atmosphere, or the spooky little girl that turns out to be much, much more than a Samara ripoff (The Ring, anyone?) The creepy thing was that I actually enjoyed the moments where there wasn't a thousand clones to shoot the hell out of; I relished these moments almost as much as the gratuitous fighting that splattered most areas of the game.  Don't get me wrong, though; that's not to say that F.E.A.R. seriously takes a beating when you're comparing to the most memorable set piece gun battles of, say, Half Life 2, or even Halo - F.E.A.R. doesn't need vehicles; hell, it doesn't even need crowbars. F.E.A.R. compensates for that by including slow motion into a game that is extraordinarily fast paced in nature. Using slow motion takes advantage of your character's superior reflexes to, for lack of a better description, kick the living crap out of any clone soldier that wanders into your path. This tool is quite useful in a couple of the game's larger scale battles, where there might be, say, a full squad of enemies positioned strategically ahead of you at different points. Not only will you be significantly quicker than them, enabling you to peek your head out of your hiding place and sneak in a few shots at a soldier who didn't have the luxury of returning fire quick enough to ensure his survival; but you'll also be able to dodge any slower-moving projectiles coming towards you, which comes in very handy when the game starts throwing heavily armored robots and such at you in the later stages of the campaign.  Slow motion isn't just fun to use, though - at some parts of the game it is positively essential to your survival. Put simply, the AI in F.E.A.R. is some of the best in any first person shooter I've ever played, and I've played a lot of first person shooters. When you hit enemies enough they will retreat back to their insertion point and they'll usually stay there, recuperating while they wait for you to make the first move. They'll also utilize cover far more effectively than in most games - at some points you'll see them duck behind a stack of boxes or something and they'll secretly move to another point of cover and surprise you from springing out from an unexpected place.  And that's not all - slow motion also holds a lot of amusement value. The game uses a brilliant physics engine AND has destructible environments, and these two elements, slowed down, just surmounts to some really beautiful-looking scenes. At many points in the game you'll get to witness flying shards of glass, bullets tearing holes out of walls, exploding bodies, decapitations, random paranormal effects such as swinging lights, hallucinations, and other such like, all in slow motion. I tell you, watching a soldier's body being buffeted with a close range machine gun spurt and then flying down a corridor with the impact is something you've got to experience at least once throughout the course of the game - especially since the game's rather limited arsenal of weapons manage to be extremely satisfying.  Despite all the above elements, its still the parts without all the overblown fight scenes that captivated me in F.E.A.R. The storyline and the few-and-far-between cinematic scenes, for one thing. At the beginning of the game you're just expecting a mildly convoluted psychological-themed ride through a relatively dark facility, much like transplanting Doom 3 with Half Life 2 and then throwing a Samara-esque little girl in there, too. Turns out that F.E.A.R.'s storyline is much more captivating than at first sight - it involves the little girl quite heavily, and the revelations over the course of the game, combined with many intriguingly gruesome hallucination scenes, all build up to an absolutely amazing ending; one of the best endings in gaming ever, in my opinion, and that alone is enough for me to justify buying its expansion Extraction Point, possibly soon.  The portions of the game without dozens of soldiers to shoot at are just as good. The game's atmosphere is literally perfect and for many people, F.E.A.R. will be a game that they will be reluctant to, and eventually refuse to play in the dark. Dimly lit corridors are soaked with silence and the ambient noises that permeate the quiet are usually enough to make you feel genuinely uneasy, and in the sections with no light you'll be telling yourself that you don't want to go down there, you're not going down there... this adds to the game's unpredictability, really. On almost every section where you expect something to happen, it doesn't, and you'll be left with a mingled feeling of relief, disappointment, and shock.\\xa0On the contrary, many of the lighter sections greet you with a nicely unexpected hallucination, whose stark imagery and intriguing climaxes will have you writhing on your seat. But of course, there are moments that involve the two major creeps of the game - the little girl herself, and the psychic cannibal Paxton Fettel, who is linked to every single clone in the entire game. The little girl isn't just some cheap thrill, though - she ends up being more creepy than The Ring's star spook, and she's also got a fair bit of history behind her, and I won't ruin it, but she's also a very central part of the game's amazing ending. Many dark sequences of the game end up being shook up by a skull-crushing ringing sound (this sound precedes every major scare scene in the entire game, and it ends up becoming a telltale sound of complete utter inescapable dread) and then bang, right after that shock of white noise, the girl will appear... or the cannibal... or some innocent guy will be dragged through a ventilation shaft, or a TV will suddenly greet you with a live feed of an antagonist, and various other phenomena along those lines.  The silence and the ambience alone are enough to conjure the best atmosphere I've ever experienced in a video game. The graphics, too, are stunningly well realized - the slow motion is enough to justify that, as the assorted physics-related deaths, the special effects, the explosions... they're all wondrous to behold. The lighting is also used extremely effectively and it works in perfect pairing with the brilliantly freaky audio.  All in all, I think I've mentioned everything that makes F.E.A.R. memorable, and if you really read all the above review, you should be salivating and straight after recommending this, you'll be off to amazon or eBay to buy the game and then play it over the course of a weekend or so, and spend the entire two days shivering in despair and shock. It's difficult to sleep in the dark after playing this game in pitch black and with headphones equipped, I'll tell you that much - and if you're not in it for the psychological fright, then despite the fact that you're missing the point slightly, you won't be disappointed with the overblown firefights you'll trawl through over the game's rather short 9 or 10 hours. Definitely one of the most memorable FPS games of recent times.\",\n",

The graphics are remarkably better considering the game was released only two years later, although it's mostly cosmetic enhancements to a now-seriously dated engine, especially looking at the gravity and other physics.The game itself is mostly solid, with fun, stealthy shooting, but there are a few gripes I have. They added respawning enemies that make it annoying when you're scouring the area for every intelligence item and extra objective you can find and they start looking for you upon finding dead bodies. The flashlight is now an inventory item instead of something you can just turn on while still shooting. I'm just not as big a fan of this game's pacing, it starts off very strong but the formula becomes more transparent as you go on and it seems a bit anticlimactic with the boring final level, and the game's apparent refusal to kill off any characters. The first game saw you infiltrating and causing havoc in various heavily defended fortresses, NOLF 2 spends too much time making you run around India and in abandoned stations in the snow. It's still a good game, just a slight disappointment after the first.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Apollo Justice is the fourth game of the semi-popular 'Phoenix Wright' or 'Gyakuten Saiban' as they are known in Japan.While the original 3 games with the limited exception of the final case in Ace Attorney were ported from the GBA, Apollo Justice is entirely built ground up for the DS system making it a first for Capcoms franchise.Incase you are unaware of the concept of Ace Attorney games, you play as a defense attorney named Phoenix Wright (or in this game) the new rookie Apollo Justice. The main crux of the gameplay is a somewhat updated version of what a point and click adventure would have been 12 years or so ago. Proceedings always start with being introduced to an accused client through your mutual friends who bring with them a complicated back story and an always bizarre unwillingness to tell you what actually happened. You then after a bit of back story proceed to investigate the alleged crime and start piecing together what happened, why it happened and most importantly why your client is innocent.You achieve this goal through pointing out prosecution contradictions and mistruths in a court room setting by pressing witnesses and presenting evidence. This is all done on the DS via the touch screen and using the microphone to yell 'Objection' or 'Hold It' which adds an extra layer of fun to the proceedings.Although the game sounds serious and does indeed deal with various grizzly murders, it's anime style presentation and goofy comedy makes it come across as more of a fun amateur detective romp than any serious CSI style crime drama. That being said though the cases can really grip you and some of the twists can really catch you off guard.Following the conclusion of the 3rd game. Main protagonist Phoenix Wright is no longer an attorney due to losing his license for Perjury. So for this game you play his protege as it were, the oddly named Apollo Justice. This isn't to say Phoenix isn't in the game, infact he's a central character throughout the entire plot, some other characters from previous games make cameo's but for the most part it is an entirely all new cast. This is probably a smart move as a 4th appearance from some of the more annoying cast members (notably Lotta Hart & Larry Butz) would have been borderline tedious at this point in the series.Maya & Pearl are replaced as comic relief tag along partners by Phoenix's adopted step-daughter Trucy Wright. Not that she's any more normal, you're pretty much exchanging some bizarre druid style sisters for a wannabe trainee magician. Still she converses with you and the people you meet, offers advice and proves to be an important part of the overall story.There's 4 cases in the game (the usual amount for the series) and they all end up tying together. Some interesting use of the DS technology is involved during events, some that's been seen before in the additional 5th case for the Ace Attorney with some completely new tools such as an X-Ray machine and a sound mixing board.The games puzzles for the most part are very logical and there's only a few instances of frustration. Notably having to investigate a fairly generic and seemingly unimportant door in a BG to move the game forward and also having to present a specific item of evidence when two pieces in your possession would prove the same point.There is also some rather daft story twists which are a bit /too/ silly for their own good. Such as a panty thief and a noodle stand vendor who talks endlessly about his uhum 'salty broth'. That being said, some of the low-key ingame humour is actually quite amusing. There's a gangster boss who looks the splitting image of Marlon Brando, a prosecutor named Klavier who spouts lines from classic rock tunes at every opportunity and Mr Hat, who really defies all explanation.The game is a good length and will take you at least 15-20 hours to finish. There isn't any replay value with this sort of game however so you should take that into consideration when deciding how much you're willing to pay.For a long time Phoenix Wright fan. This game still has everything you loved about the series since game one. Apollo is an equally endearing protagonist as Phoenix ever was and his own special skill of 'Observation' brings something new just as Psyche-locks did with the second. While some fan-favourite characters such as Miles Edgeworth are MIA references to past ingame material such as the Steel Samurai are still included and worthy of a chuckle when they crop up.For new-comers although the game makes an attempt at putting the previous games into the past, it still really isn't a recommended starting point. The main theme that runs through Apollo Justice is the events of Phoenix Wright in the past and without experiencing his back story it'd be hard to care exactly why he was wronged the way he was.As a DS game the presentation is handled fantastically with clean, well animated characters and snappy expertly penned dialogue. The music isn't quite on par with previous games but as it proves quite vital in a murder at a rock concert during the story it still manages to perform its function. The save at anytime function is still present which makes the game easy to play on the move (albeit a little easy if you want to use it to cheat via trial and error).Overall it's a fantastic game and it'll be interesting to see what direction the Ace Attorney series goes off into next now it's new leading character has been fully established. \\xa0 Good: Gripping story, witty dialogue, top notch presentation.Bad: Lack of replay, adult themes 'kiddified' on occasion, save system lowers overall difficulty.\",\n",

Graphically the game looks a little cartoony but you don't seem to notice this as you will still gasp in awe, at the games environments and the setups that 2K have set for you. Water effects are amazing, as are other elements of the game such as fire, ice, electricity etc. they all look great.The storyline is great to unravel, as there is so many mysteries, twists as well as turns you will just become warped into the game, you will start at 10am and finish at 3am. However the story seems to be slightly cut short, which is a shame as, if 2K could have extended that, the game would become even more perfect.All the sounds in the game are in tune with the environment, you will get echos and such. Nothing in Bioshocks sound bank really stands out it becomes something you expect.The difficulties of Bioshock are to tamed in my opinion, as I managed to get Hard difficulty done without to many problems. And then I attempted Easy which I managed to get through the game in 8 Hours as I just breezed through it like wind.The new ideas of Plasmids and Big Daddies and LIttle Sisters etc. all contribute to make this game, one of the best games of this generation. The real only complaint is no penalty of death. It is a shame there could be no online play as I think they could have done it, it would be nice if 2K realeased an expansion on the Marketplace or Staright to Disc. So that we could have, online play. Here are my ideas for online play:Save The Sister: Team 1: Big Daddies Team 2: SplicersBig Daddies must protect little sister/s from the splicers if all splicers or little sisters are dead opposite team wins.Deathmatch: Free For AllNeed I explain more?Team Deathmatch: Team BasedNeed I explain more?Capture the Adam: AquisitionLike capture the flag only with an ADAM jar.Overall Bioshock is a great game for all those looking for a great storyline as well as features.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Gears of War was released in 2006 for the Xbox 360 and became an instant hit with gamers and critics and can be considered the Xbox equivalent to resident Evil 4 for GameCube, and PS2. Gears starts out with Marcus Fenix in his prison cell, imprisoned for disobeying orders and attempting to save his dad's life. He failed and was sentenced to forty years, but the sentence was cut short as the prison was emptied and the inmates were all recruited to join the C.O.G. army to fight against the Locust Horde, a large army of mole like creatures without the fur and with sharp pointy teeth. The Locust have one goal in mind: the complete anhilation of human life on the planet Sera. The game goes from the prison scenery to several other areas including and underground mining facility, a refugee campsite flooded with Kryll, a bat like ravenous bird that will kill you, fast.  The gameplay in Gears isn't anything special or groundbreaking but it uses a duck and cover system used by going against any flat surface and tapping the space bar. Melee attacks are preformed by either the B of F keys (and if you're smart you'll change it to the left Shift key of some other more comfortable position.) Most weapons have a basic whack your opponent with the side of your gun melee attack, but the lancer assault rifle has a chainsaw bayonet which provides an instant kill. Grenades also have a special melee ability in that they stick to the enemy that is in your sights. The final special attack is the blade on the torque bow but it's the least interesting of the trio.  The game consists of five acts with numerous chapters in each. Roughly 80% of these chapters are the same as the 360 version but the beginning of act five starts off the new chapters which more than doubles the length of the final act which normally could of been completed within an hour. The new chapters are well made and provide closure to the Brumak scene at the end of act four but are by no mean a reason to trade your 360 version in and pick up the PC version. The Brumak boss battle is disappointingly easy for a game with such a high difficulty level, but it is fun to play and shows promise for a large scale conflict with two or three Brumaks in the sequel.  In addition to the new chapters there is also two new multiplayer maps and a new game mode, if you can find anyone to play it with. Seriously, the multiplayer is a whole lot of fun in this game, it's just there aren't enough people playing at once to really get a good game going. And as for the online co-op, forget about it. Very rarely will you find one, thats ONE, co-op game that you can join to try and get the Dom themed achievements.  Dell recently scrapped the dimension line of PCs and have replaced them with the Inspiron series which are the bare basics for Windows Vista PCs. Running on one you can get near Xbox 360 quality gameplay with minor lag (mostly minor) and some jaggies here and there if you just play with it for a while. Be forewarned though, integrated graphics are not your friend. For those who mock those like me with fairly weak PCs, Gears will look beautiful. There are more details in this version than the 360 version although there is still some very minor lag even with the greatest of PCs.  The soundtrack is very atmospheric and moody which works well in its favor. The sound effects are usually dead on with some stuttering during the cut scenes, something Half Life 2 player may know a little bit about.  To do anything in this game requires a Games for Windows LIVE account which is the same service as Xbox LIVE. In fact the only difference between the Windows LIVE service and the Xbox LIVE service is that PC gamers get the benefit of typing on a keyboard in full complete sentences while our console inferiors are stuck with an on screen keyboard. The LIVE multiplayer components require a Gold account, a month of which is free after registering your code online, and achievements for multiplayer (save for the co-op ones) cannot be earned without Gold.  Achievements in this game are not hard to get for the single player experience but the multiplayer achievements require a tedious amount of hours to unlock all of them. The most notable is a required 10,000 kill on a ranked match which requires LIVE Gold. The achievements are separate from the 360 version so buying both will earn you 2 sets of achievements.  All of the controls of the 360 version are available with the use of a 360 controller. All in all the keyboard and mouse add very little to the experience but at the same time take nothing away. This is a very solid port with several glitches, very few of which are game ruining, but can be overcome on nearly all occasions. One moment in my history stands out as I went to walk forward to hug a wall when I was lifted three feet above the ground unable to be moved from my position. On a humorous occasion I was hurled 15 feet directly to the right which worked out as I was headed that way anyways.  Basically it comes down to this: While the LIVE service is a drag for PC gamers it is a good way to keep in touch with friends. If you have any intention of buying a 360 later on this game will make you feel better about buying a years worth of the LIVE service for your console with only one or two games on it. There is also a map editor with all the tool Epic used to create the game, but you have to search the installation process to install it and even then it might not install. Despite the glitches and the occasional lag this is a solid purchase that any PC gamer should be glad to have in their collection.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Lets get one thing straight from the get-go: I am by no means a Super Smash Bros. expert. I’ve played every incarnation of the game, but the series has never held my attention for very long, as I have never had friends around who like playing it regularly. And a Smash Bros. game without multiplayer satisfaction is hardly Smash Bros. at all. So, for now, lets stick to what I do know about this game. The graphics are splendid enough, especially when you consider that the Wii can only output in the aging 480p format. The framerate is smooth and unwaivering, the textures are crisp, and the animations are fluid and believable. The sounds of the game are great, with each character having his own taunts, grunts, and yelps, although most of the sounds seem like they were simply copied over from the last Smash Bros. game. The gameplay is identical to previous versions with a few minor additions. First and foremost is the “Final Smash” ability, which for most characters equates to a screen-wide KO ability that you activate after hitting a floating item a few times, although this doesn’t really add new strategies to matches other than “who can punch the smash ball quicker.” There are a few new items and some notable new characters, but nothing that can be classified as groundbreaking. The biggest addition to the game is the single-player Subspace Emmisary mode, which follows a story that finds you battling a space-dwelling evildoer that shoots arrow-shaped energy beams at protagonists that transform them into miniature statues of themselves. While this storyline may seem absurd, the challenges and gameplay quirks that the mode offer are extremely fun, and by the end of the campaign you’ll have played every character at least once. The other single player modes are knock offs of the previous games’ campaigns, so you won’t find anything shiny and new there. One would think that free online multi player would be the best addition to the franchise, and perhaps that one person would be correct. But in order for Nintendo to keep Brawl a T-rated game, they had to omit all the features that make online multi player a more personal experience. You won’t be able to voice or text chat with players, and you have no choice regarding who you’ll play online. If you have the friend codes of people you know, you can set up a friend match, but you’re still stuck with a silent taunt-less multi player experience. Watching my roommate play his friend online while keeping the cell phone to his ear to talk to his opponent may get a chuckle every now and again, but it merely highlights Nintendo’s need to beef up their online gaming experience. While there doesn’t appear to be anything truly original or revolutionary about Smash Bros. Brawl, it’s still worthy of high praise. Multi player Smash Bros. has always been a top-notch experience, and it’s refreshing to see that Nintendo has maintained, if not exceeded, that experience in Brawl. The game still caters to players of all skill levels, and while amateur button mashers will enjoy the game, they are easily dominated by those who take the time to learn the intricacies of the game mechanics. And while the Subspace Emmisary mode may have given the single-player offering a much-needed shot in the arm, this game continues to be a multi player beat down seminar, and should not be purchased for any other reason.',\n",

Graphically I think its rubbish, cinematics look good but thats only because it is pre-rendered and not using the games engine. Vampires do not seem real as no-one in the right mind runs like that. Sound-wise yeah I think its accurate the guns sound realistic i suppose. Voice acting is okay but could be better. I have no other comments on sound as I stopped playing after the first mission.Story.... **** A city taken over by vampires... GET REAL! Someone should have noticed you don\\'t exactly go \"Oh we lost contact with Los Angeles... oh well!\" The citizens should have known to! \"Oh I can\\'t phone my friend next door and she hasn\\'t been at school and mommy hasn\\'t come back from the shop in days... oh well!\" Vampires cannot run an entire city with absolutley no-one noticing except the special forces. The only thing that really saves vampire rain, is that it is a proper stealth game as you die in 2 slashes. And it is nice to see a realistic health system as you can\\'t take more than 2 shots or even 1 in real life.This game is only for people who love stealth games to bits and neglect anything else except the stealth.',\n",

       "  'description': \"The expansion to the first game doesn't really add much to the experience and seems a bit weak because of it. They added the ability to cook grenades, which is nice but doesn't seem necessary. They added the worst sprint in the history of video games, which takes you out of the realism because of its implementation. The speed boost is only slight, but worse is that it only lasts for about a second before you have to slow down again and let the meter charge back up. One second seems like a reasonable amount of time for a highly-trained, elite soldier to be able to run, doesn't it?The British campaign was probably my favorite part, with a cool change of pace being a gunner in a bomber plane (although the series' penchant for making you do all the real work became horribly exposed when two other gunners were killed and I had to man three positions while performing maintenance as the other survivor stayed stuck to his gun) and then later joining in some covert operations. The other sections are less inspired, as they rely on just throwing huge, overwhelming battles at you, and as fun as it is to shoot nazis, it just gets ridiculous somewhere along the way. It's an enjoyable expansion but doesn't bring much to the table.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Having never played a DMC game prior to this, the fourth installment, I was skeptical about what all the hubbub was. On the surface, the game's a straightforward hack and slasher with some fancy moves, but digging below that, you'll find a game with an intricate fight system, well produced cutscenes, and undeniable charm.You don't have to have played and of the previous Devil May Cry titles to be able to enjoy this game, but it certainly is advantageous to be familiar with the characters and concept. In this game, infamous demon hunter Dante kills the leader of a religious sect that worships the demon Sparda as their God and has recently been up to nefarious no-gooderies such as capturing and experimenting on various dangerous demons. You'll start playing the game as Nero, one of the knights of the Order of the Sword charged with hunting down Dante, but as the plot thickens and gets more complicated, you'll be playing as Dante again until picking up as Nero again for the game's conclusion. Overall, the plot can get convoluted and it's kinda hard to tell what the hell is actually going on in some moments, but it's overall decently written stuff and charming characters such as the sarcastic tough guy Nero, or the hilariously over the top antics of Dante taking front and center in some of the best choreographed and produced cutscenes that manage to hold your attention throughout the game's lengthy campaign.And the campaign best be lengthy, because there isn't anything else to do in Devil May Cry 4. You can replay sections of the campaign on higher difficulties and attempt to get higher scores as well as executing the various bonus missions around the levels, but there's little in the way of replay value. \\xa0  So, it's good that the gameplay you do take part in is rather good. The game's all about chaining sword combos together to pulverize the various demon baddies you take on, coupled with some gun blasting and other abilities. You'll start out playing as Nero who is a very no-frills fighter and has some pretty basic attacks, but his real draw is his possessed right arm known as the Devil Bringer that can grab and slam enemies from long range, and whose skills play in particularly awesomely during boss fights, which overall, makes Nero a very deliberate, yet exciting character to play as.Once control shifts over to Dante, things get complicated, as the demon hunter has a slew of weapons and fighting styles to choose from. You'll also be missing the Devil Bringer at this point, so Dante might seem like a step down at first. However, once you start goofing around with Dante's various fighting styles (such as Swordmaster and Gunslinger) you'll find he's an absolute dynamo with some lightening fast combos and skills to play around with. It's a nice contrast to have, and both characters are a joy to play as, as their personalities are both likeable and skills both apt. It's hard to choose whether it's funner to use the powerhouse Nero, swatting enemies away only to pull them back in and slam them, or the swift Dante, dancing around enemies as he cuts them to ribbons and fills them full of holes.On the presentation front, Devil May Cry is stellar. The cutscenes are easily some of the best looking of this generation, and although the action never gets that hot during actual gameplay, and the visuals will look slightly stunted in game, there is still plenty of slick animations and awesome scenery to feast your eyes on in this game. In the sound department, sound effects of guns blazing, swords clashing, and baddies roaring all sound appropriately over the top, as do the voice actors. Some might accuse the actors of being too cheesy in their delivery, but considering the seriousness that some of these topics could have inherited, such as the occult and hyper violence, it's good to see the game has an excellent sense of humor. It's just something you either get or you don't, and I got it.One thing I COULDN'T get, was that horrible... industrial suckfest music that always plays when you enter combat. Honestly, it's quite grating, and considering the rest of the music is only atmospheric, the sound track takes a considerable hit when this diddy starts playing. Aside from Kyrie's song she sings in the beginning, the rest of the music is forgettable.Overall, DMC 4 is a great hack and slash game with a surprisingly deep fighting system, and some diversity that other games in the genre just don't have. Coupled with a great presentation, and a cheesy, but well delivered story line, you get a solid action title that is easy to recommend to anyone. Just don't ask me to listen to that combat song anymore.\",\n",

However COC does not come without flaws.The graphics in my opinion suit the game perfectly, as using dark textures and using a 1920's film effect, it really sets you in to the scary atmosphere that COC has to offer. Voice acting is not flawed in the slightest, it really makes you feel as though that person is actaully speaking and not the actor him/herself.Gameplay is COCs main flaw, as the thing that scares you the most in the game is... no weapon. As you are defenseless naturally you would begin to become scared if you heard strange noises or mauled faces around you. But as soon as you pick up a firearm the game becomes a stupid shooter and begins to loose its fear factor, bit by bit. Overall COC is a nice looking and great sounding game. And remains a true thriller... to start with. If you didn't get to use a gun so many times this game would have remained a pinnacle... of gaming fear.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"This is the second brain training title from Dr. Kawashima and as you slot in the cartridge and load it up, you'll think you're playing the wrong game. Why? It looks and sounds like the old game, right down to some of the things Dr. Kawashima says. The only thing that is different in this second Brain Training game is the actual training games and the Sudoku puzzles. Is this a bad thing? Not at all - fans of the first game will love this game too; however there is nothing much here to appeal to people who disliked Kawashima's first title.For people who are new to the whole Brain Training scene, here is a brief summary: you hold your DS on its side and you do three games which test your brain. After the three games are completed, you will then be given a brain age ranging from 20-80, the latter being the worst and the one you obviously don't want. You can also select the training option to pick which game you want to practice on.For the actual games, there are the great, good, okay and down-right awful. The best has to be 'Masterpiece Recital' which has a keyboard on the touch screen and a sheet of scrolling music on the left screen. You have to press the corresponding keys on the keyboard as the arrows scroll over it on the music sheet - it's very fun and slightly tricky! A good but annoying game is one which has you drawing out a symbol which corresponds to the number. It sounds boring, but is actually quite fun. There is, however, one downside to this game - a couple of symbols are extremely sensitive on and if you draw a really obvious percentage sign, it still won’t accept it, damaging your score overall. The worst game of the lot has to be where you have to remember which number goes into which square and you have a time limit of two minutes. You just sit there for two minutes remembering numbers. That's it. What a load of fun... or not. There are also lots of other games, but mentioned above are the select few that stand out for their own reasons.Then there is the section for Sudoku puzzles, if that is your kind of thing. If not, you can skip over it without missing out on anything, but it takes your fancy you won’t be disappointed. It is controlled with the touch screen and has you drawing on what numbers you want where. It is very well made and you are getting quite a lot for what is a budget priced game.This game is pretty much the same as the last one, and you can take that as you wish. However, considering it is basically the same game, it gets the exact same score as it did last time. Another decent, quick-to-play Brain Training game.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"After a rather long and frustrating wait, the EU was finally given tickets to Rockband on the 23rd of May. Rockband being EA's prime time foray (after Boom Boom Rocket) into the exciting world of the rhythm game genre. With Guitar Hero being one of the biggest selling games of all time and the necessary guitar peripheral sales bringing tidy amounts of profit it was only a matter of time before EA wanted a slice of that pie, buying out the original creators of Guitar Hero -Harmonix. Rockband at first inspection seems nothing special other than an unimaginative rip-off but aims and succeeds (for the most part) at doing everything in a better and bigger scale. Yes you can play guitar along with tracks as you can in GH, but now you can also sing along just like in Singstar. Still not enough? how about the ultimate selling pitch - drums. Who doesn't at sometime tap along to whatever tune their hearing? Combine these assets along with every song on the disc being a master track, unlike GH's rather dodgy covers. Huge customisation options and a truely endless array of multi player options; online leaderboards, band world tours, score duels. You name it, if you ever wished Guitar Hero could do something it didn't offer chances are Rockband has it. As there is ultimately 3 disciplines in Rockband, it makes sense for me to cover them each seperately. Guitar: If you ever played the Guitar Hero games previously you'll be right at home with how this system works. Using either the game branded Stratocaster (or any of the GH guitars) a fretboard scrolls down your screen with coloured dots indicating which of the corresponding buttons should be held down on your controller and strummed according to the song in question. On easy levels you'll only be using 3 of the 5 buttons and more complicated manoeuvres such as chords, hammer-ons and pull-offs are left well out of reach until you advance towards later difficulty levels. The note lists are constructed well with otherwise quite boring songs being made fun and endearing to play.   Rockband introduces guitar solos and BRE's (big rock endings). In which if you're in possession of the rockband strat you can use the top frets without the need to stum the bar to build your points up with great ease (and posturing).  One major note of criticism however is the games implementation of hammer-ons and pull-offs.Guitar Hero 3 recently made a great improvement to this with lowering the precision needed to perform this technique and as a result improved the playability factor immensely. Here on Rockband however it still feels very loose if it will register correctly. A minor gripe which can be overcome with practise, but it still feels stuck in the past compared to where the GH series is now.   It's also worth pointing out that compared to Guitar Hero 3 the game is quite a big deal easier. While this might be good news to those that struggled even completing medium on that game, to those who finished in the top scores on expert it's a real game shortner. Expert can be compared to Hard and with the exception of some downloadable tracks all but 2 of the 45 standard songs on the disc could be 5 starred on expert first go around. Microphone: Using either the official Rockstar microphone, any USB mic or even the 360 headset. The vocal mode is a great addition to a game of this type. It works almost exactly the same as Sonys 'Singstar'. With the words scrolling alongside pitchbars to which the aim is to sync up as close as possible. Thankfully you don't have to sing in the same key as long as the pitch of the word is correct. Occasionally you also have to strike the microphone in-time with a tambourine or cowbell, although rare they are a fun addition and add to the illusion of being a front man in a rock group.  The problem with the singing option in the game is that as voice recognition isn't exactly at the level of the human ear (if you have ever used naturally speaking on a PC you will fully understand). You can essentially spout any old nonsense and as long as the timing and pitch is correct it will still register as correct. This makes the higher scores on the game leaderboard suspiciously illegit and the truely talented singers using the game might feel a bit cheated as a result.   This doesn't mean that it's easy though, getting high scores on even medium is a real challenge. Expert being near on impossible. In terms of a multiplayer setting, having someone able to sing vocals who might otherwise shy away from drums or guitar is a welcome option.    Drums: The drums for most if not all people are the major selling point for the game. Note patterns fall in a similar fashion to that of the guitar with 4 drumpads and a kick pedal being the equivalent of your coloured buttons on the guitar.  The note patterns are very accurate and realistic (only dismissing very fast kick triplets) and those competent with playing drums in real life should be able to get through medium and hard modes in a breeze. Expert is a whole different story however, there you'll need second by second analysis of what's happening to prevent from failing miserably.   Luckily the practice mode for drums (as well as the other instruments) is incredibly useful with the option to slow the song down in percentages and in real time rather than just slow & slower. Compared to Rockband, it's a great improvement. The huge almost gamebreaking problem with the drums is infact the drums themselves. Obviously with real electronic kits costing upto £1000+ a £70 kit isn't going to be quite as efficient. The problem with Rockbands is that it's downright rubbish. The drum pads are incredibly loud & un-sensitive (going by an EL model - the standard for the EU) and the red pad in particular (which acts as the snare) needs quite severe end user modification to function effectively on any difficulty level past easy or medium. Completing a song with 98-99% notes hit and still scoring only 3/5 stars due to the inability to keep a combo thanks to notes not registering on the kit is about as emotionally draining and annoying as a user experience gets. America apparently have better made kits these days but having tried 3 myself now, it seems all kits being shipped in the EU have this problem. The kick pedal is also very fragile and I personally found that the spring doesn't have enough push back. Playing through on expert it felt like my ankle was doing the work of the spring most the time. Overall it's very disappointing, if your playing in a multiplayer group where getting a perfect score isn't as important as passing then it's still fun to bash around on. But as the solo mode is score-based here it fails miserably. A huge disappointment. Back to the game itself; I touched on the customisation options earlier on. Unlike in Guitar Hero where you had to select from a handful of pre-rendered characters, here you really can create your own rock god/goddess. A rockshop provides the front to decide whether your character is going to be Rock, Metal or Goth and as a result offers haircuts, tattoos (which the user can layer and edit) and clothes to make this person exactly how you envision. You buy and unlock further options by earning money from completing songs in single and multiplayer career modes. The songlist tends to make or break the game and Rockband really pisses all over Guitar Hero in terms of having the original songs on offer rather than cover versions. The online store is also regularly updated every week and has something for everyone on offer at reasonable prices. The only criticism being that although a number of huge bands are represented it never seems to be their most famous hits that are chosen as their game song. While sometimes this is addressed in the additional downloadable track packs why they couldn't have been chosen as the on-disc song comes across a bit miserly. It's also come to the point where 3 guitar hero games previous, alot of 'big' songs have already been done per-se. A handful of tracks on Rockband have already appeared on Guitar Heroes which makes playing through them another umpteenth amount of times somewhat tedious. The multiplayer options are outstanding. Band world tour encourages you to routinely get together with the same people in the aim of increasing fans by performing songs and preset set-lists at different difficulty levels. The only gripe about this is that there isn't an online function to recruit band members as it has to be all done locally. Fine if you have people nearby competent with the game, otherwise (like me) your fucked. There are single player online modes such as 'Score Duel' which has each player competing for the biggest score, and 'Tug Of War' where the person who keeps a combo the longest comes out on top.  Although both fun, a game breaking problem with these is the ability for a player to quit out at any moment. Rather than register as a win for the remaining player it simply just restarts them back to the menu. Therefore. all the sore losers who four minutes through a song see no way of coming back to win simply quit out preventing the other from a victory.  Why this hasn't been patched by now is beyond me considering the amount of time it's been out in the US. Truly shocking. Other than going for achievements it makes you want to avoid these play modes altogether and aim instead at improving you position on the solo scoreboards where other peoples bad sense of sportsmanship won't ruin your game. Overall Rockband is certainly a fun and ambitious game. Despite poor quality and expensive peripherals, easy guitar note charts and a less than stellar song listing, the improvements it still manages to make over Guitar Hero are immense. It's due to these improvements infact that Guitar Hero are now introducing drums into the next iteration of their own franchise as well as mastertracks. Until we can see how that pans out it's more than worth the money if your a fan of rhythm games or music in general to book a gig with Rockband.   Good: Numerous game options, master tracks, addition of vocals & drums to GH formula.Bad: Difficulty swings towards the easy side, poor quality peripherals, no online band tour\",\n",

       "  'description': 'If you enjoy sweet, even sappy, JRPGs where the world shines like a sort of CG animated Candy Land then Eternal Sonata is likely the game for you. However, if you\\'re somewhat ambivalent toward the more emotion heavy JPRGs, or if you require a stiff challenge from your RPGs then there is a good chance that Eternal Sonata isn\\'t the game for you.  Eternal Sonata tells the story of Frederic Chopin\\'s life and final days on his death bed and a world that he may or may not be imagining in his sleep. The game play takes place entirely in Chopin\\'s sort of dream world where mineral powder has recently become very popular amongst the populous as a cure for just about everything. The central mystery of the game revolves around the motives of those selling the mineral powder that as you probably can guess might not be all it is cracked up to be .  The connections between Chopin\\'s world that you are provided glimpses of from time to time and the world you spend your time playing in are symbolic at best, and even it bit disruptive to the flow of the game as you the player are bounced back and forth. The connection between those worlds is largely irrelevant to how much you\\'ll enjoy the game. Fortunately, the characters in the dream world are a bit more interesting than Chopin\\'s own real life story, at least in terms of how they are presented.  The characters that inhabit the world you play in are as bright and spunky and yet manage to provide enough variety amongst them to keep them each interesting in their own way in terms of both character and combat. Along with Chopin himself there is a warm hearted and mysterious girl named Polka, a pair of street urchins in Allegretto and Beat, a crew of rebels and several other characters you will pickup along the way. Depending on what point in the game you\\'re talking about there are up to nine characters you can choose from during your adventures and you can a total of three at a time into battle.  The characters bright personalities are only outshined by the game\\'s graphics. Eternal Sonata is a gorgeous game. While it is a fairly linear game and is somewhat limited in terms of space to explore this gives Eternal Sonata a maliciously crafted feel. Most scenes and spaces are beautifully animated with bright bold colors as if they were an impressionist painting.   Provided you\\'re not overwhelmed by the intense characters and graphics it is hard not to smile or at least stop and admire the view now and then. The only downside being that the characters clothing and weapons do not change visually thru the entire game. You do equip a variety of weapons, clothing, accessories, and armor but sadly they have no impact on your characters outward appearance. With such beautifully crafted characters it takes a bit of fun out of buying new items for them if they never actually change their appearance.  The combat in Eternal Sonata uses an interesting light / dark system. When moving thru the world of Eternal Sonata you can (for the most part) pick and choose what enemy encounters you wish to have and what encounters you wish avoid simply by walking into enemies or maneuvering around them.   Upon encountering an enemy the battlefield will either be predominantly light or predominantly dark with opposite patches in various places. What special attacks are available to you are determined by the spaces light or dark characteristics. Stand in a light patch and you have one set of special attacks, stand in dark and you will have another set of attacks. All characters have different light and dark special attacks and will learn new such attacks as they level up. Additionally some items can cast a light or dark aura around you and even the shadows of enemies can provide dark palaces where you can use the associated attacks.   Each character and enemy takes their turn maneuvering and attacking. Each turn is allotted a set amount of time to attack. During your time you can pull off as many regular and special attacks as you can before time runs out. There is also an \"echo system\" where by a series regular attacks of all the characters are added up and can be used to unleash particularly powerful special attacks.  In addition to your characters leveling up your party can level up too. The result of your party leveling up changes for each level you move up. Each level provides both bonuses and some time limits imposed on the entire party. In general each time your party levels up the combat becomes increasingly fast and furious and the strategies you use will change depending on those levels as well. The result is that the combat remains fresh and exciting thru the entire game.  If there is a downside to the combat it is that the opponents you will fight in Eternal Sonata are almost universally weak and highly repetitive. While your enemies can use the light and dark spaces on the battlefield to go as far as even morph into different creatures the morphing almost seems like a contrivance to keep things fresh in terms of the variety of enemies.   In truth even with morphing enemies your approach to them won\\'t need to change much at all. Also it is disappointing that as you progress thru the latter half of the game you are simply presented identical opponents to those you fought in the first half, and those really aren\\'t that much stronger.   It doesn\\'t help that one character has an ability to take and sell photographs that will provide you with an incredible amount of money. Even if you just dabble in the photography system you\\'ll be able to buy more than enough weapons, armor, and healing items thru the entire game.  Unless you choose to skip a lot of encounters and race thru the game your characters will level up fairly quickly. I am by no means a seasoned RPG player and I was never once killed by any of the standard enemies throughout the entire game. Nor did I feel that I was ever really threatened by them.  The game does provide the option to play thru it again after you complete it the first time at a notably increased difficulty level although that hardly seems to make up for what is a surprisingly easy first run thru. There aren\\'t many optional activities and just about any player should get thru Eternal Sonata in about thirty hours.   Another disappointment is the dialogue throughout Eternal Sonata. While the characters personalities are fun and enjoyable the dialogue can be odd and even grating. It can be odd when a number of times thru the game the characters will have discussion pondering topics like revolution or blind patriotism without seemingly anything initiating the conversation. Of course after the very next plot event later the discussion is suddenly very much on topic. It might be thought of as foreshadowing but it the discussions happen so often, are awfully specific, and it are so heavy handed it ruins many of plot twists thru the whole game. It doesn\\'t help that there aren\\'t many plot twists to begin with.  Additionally the dialogue between characters often seems a bit awkward. The voice acting with different accents is great all around. However, many phrases throughout the game are recycled ad nauseam such as \"suffering from a terminal illness\" in the same discussion by the all characters, even throughout the entire game. Perhaps it was a result of the translation or just a difference between Japanese to English but nobody ever just truncates a phrase like that to \"dying\". It doesn\\'t help that it even goes beyond phrases to where entire sentences (that often seem a bit pretentious and melodramatic to begin with) are repeated word for word as they go around the group and discuss the matter.  One scene that should be particularly poignant involves a five minute discussion between two characters. One character leaves and the other remains behind and reflects on the discussion. The problem being that while character reflects out loud about the conversation they just had they also have a series of flashbacks that covers ever single word of the discussion…. that you were just shown. The result being what feels like someone stretching for time or squeezing every bit of emotional turmoil possible out of the scene that you just saw.  The relationships between characters also come up a little short of expectations if only because at thirty hours the game doesn\\'t have enough time to spend with them. There are subplots, romance, and pasts galore hinted at for many of your characters but sadly some are resolved in a rush and most others loose ends are just left hanging at the end of the game. Additionally some of the predictions and ambitions of one of the characters who plays a key role in the final scenes are never explained at all. This gives the impression that while all well meaning the game feels a bit rushed, but fortunately not incomplete.  Without loose ends is the music in Eternal Sonata. Eternal Sonata has some of the catchiest, and probably some of the most defined music in any game. Understandably this is because much of the music is Chopin\\'s own music. While other games will have vague orchestral themes for various locations Eternal Sonata\\'s themes are recognizable, memorable, and with a sort of definition and clarity that few games have. It is a wonder why more games don\\'t simply adapt great existing classical music.  Despite being of a pushover, and slathered in a fair amount of melodrama Eternal Sonata still plays great, sounds wonderful, and looks outstanding, and the story is a memorable one. If you can handle a bit of a sappy JRPG and are looking for a fairly easy but beautiful stroll thru a quality JRPG Eternal Sonata is at least worth a rental.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Game Title: Super Mario LandRelease Date: 1989Developer: Nintendo (Gunpei Yokoi)Platform: Nintendo Game BoyGenre/Type: 2D Platform Game Rating: [III/V] While Super Mario Land has some good ideas and has some originality, it barely meets the standard for a platform (or a Mario) game\\xa0and doesn’t necessarily break new ground with it… With Nintendo pushing the concept of a portable game system with interchangeable software, the Game Boy has been aching that can define it as a viable platform. This is what Super Mario Land tries to attempt. With what the player will get out of the entire game experience, the key term is “try”.In the main story of Super Mario Land the princess Daisy (not Princess Peach) has been kidnapped by Tatanga, a space creature from a far away land. Rather than taking place in the Mushroom kingdom, Super Mario Land’s setting is in the kingdom of Easton. The player assumes the role of Mario who has the task of rescuing Princess Daisy and bringing Tatanga to justice.Technologically speaking, the game borrows the engine from the First Super Mario Bros. title and re purposes it for Mario’s latest adventure. With that, the game has several worlds of varying environments. Each world consists of a few levels, with the last level ending in a boss fights. The regular levels end and transition to a small bonus stage. The bonus stage is a roulette style mini-game the player randomly hits the A button and hopes for an extra life or a power-up.There have been many changes to the Mario game formula with Super Mario Land for better or worse. One of these changes is that there is no multiplayer mode in the game which takes quite a bit away from the game as far as replay value goes. Another change is the addition of a continue feature. However, you have to be more than halfway through the game for the feature to work and have more than a certain amount of points as well. This new feature more like a headache than a blessing and is practically non-existent for both struggling players and those who excel at this game.A feature that is new to this title is the concept of vehicular combat. There are some level where the player will fly a plane or operate a submarine and can shoot enemies down blast bricks and boxes apart. There are some cases where the vehicles are used in boss fights. Though this concept is new for Mario games, it lacks depth and does not play particularly well. On top of this, vehicular has been done before and to a higher quality in game of years past.Though the graphical limitations of the Game Boy are severe, Super Mario Land makes dew and also manages to differentiate itself from previous Mario game titles when it comes to originality. With the odd environments and new enemies the game’s identity is its own. The sound effects are not particularly special in any way, but the musical soundtrack does not suffer from the same stigma. The music is quirky and adds to the game’s charm.It is unmistakably clear that Super Mario Land is a very different game when compared to the previous Mario games. The changes made to the formula help this game in some areas, but also hurt it in others. Despite these changes, Super Mario Land keeps the\\xa0 mainstays of the previous Mario games which are solid platform game play and balanced level structure. Even if the graphics and sound are not particularly special and the game lacks some standard features, Super Mario Land is a competent 2d platform game. Anyone who is already invested in a Game Boy or is a fan of the previous Mario games should definitely give this title a look.',\n",

Which is why the first day I bought it I played it all day! xD!!! The colourfellness of viva pinata can be a bit blinding but makes the game look nice none the less.The gameplay never seems to cease, there is always a new pinata, a new upgrade or a new pesky ruffian to deal with. You will be kept very busy looking after your pinatas as you; attract them, build them homes, romance them and save them from Dastardos\\'s \"lullaby\". It is also quite fun to dress up your pinatas with accessories of all shapes and sizes, from cowboy boots to a baseball cap. Also depending on what you feed your pinatas they may evolve. ((Feed a Doenut to a Preztail and Wala you have a Mallowolf))The only flaw really of viva pinata is that, after you reach level 50 there isn\\'t really much else you can do. And also they could extend pinata interaction, like the chao garden. In fact this game reminds me alot of the Sonic Adventure Battle 2 Chao Garden, only with candy filled pinatas. LETS PARTY!',\n",

It's just as unrealistic (and even seems a bit more plausible if you don't think about it too much), and works better for the kind of gameplay they're going for, where you have to stay in cover, make your shots, and then move on. If you charge the enemy, you're probably going to die, although it's fun to try.The level design is also a little different. Often you're given multiple objectives at once, and you can tackle them however you want. Usually, you're clearing out buildings, which is fun for a while, but sometimes I would have preferred a little more variety like in the first game. There's enough interesting set pieces to keep you going, and it rarely strays into the annoying territory where it puts you in a weakly fortified position and sends endless waves of enemies at you until the cavalry comes (although it does still happen). It's still fun, although I wonder how much longer it will be.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Well let me start off by saying i love this game and I am a professional online racer with it.So Forza is Microsoft studio\\'s answer to grand turismo. Its an in-depth simulation racer. The game has a few perks over grand turismo. The two most obvious being Xbox LIVE and damage. The Xbox LIVE element is well implimented with the online auction house and the several tracks and modes including series races.In a online career lobby\\xa0 the credits you earn for winning or coming in a close second through 7th depend on the number of competetors and the race length. So its pretty easily hacked to earn the online 1,000,000 credits achievement. BUT for serious competetors like most of the Forza online community its a great system of online play.The auction house is the second online implement i would like to congratulate Turn 10 on implimenting. Based on the WoW auction house users can freely put their cars on the bidding list filled with their own paint jobs and upgrades. The paint job\\'s are what sell though, rarely will you see a manufactured car go for more than 200k.Speaking of the paint job\\'s The \"livery editor\" is the system for painting ur whip. Its based off of shaped and the ability to edit the size, shape, distortion and the ability to layer these. So painting the car is more of a puzzle than it is an actual Paint job. But I cant think of a better way to paint ur car on a console without some sort of art pen.Now for the tracks of Forza Motorsport 2. The tracks vary just like in the Grand Turismo series from one Street Race, alot of real world tracks and a few fantasy tracks. The real world tracks although the top pick from around the world [in my opinion] fault with their numbers. Only 20-ish tracks with little variety within them. And also it is notably to state that the graphics on the track just plain suck. The only notable difference between the last installment and the current are the car graphics and the sky. OH YEAH, the same damn peice of grass popping up from italy\\'s mugello to Laguna Seca. SAME BLADE I SWEAR TO GOD.But graphics dont really matter for the hardcore, [which forza is taylored for] The greatest things about forza are the online mode\\'s and the number of cars. For car lovers or pro racers this is by far the greatest racer on any console.',\n",

It only takes Guybrush seconds after that to completely fall in love with the governor of this island, Elaine Marley, not knowing that some evil ghost pirate has already put his eyes on her. From there you embark on a quest of love and adventure on exotic and mysterious islands... with sword fighting.This is the game that gave the formula for all subsequent LucasArts adventures. And a successful formula that was: gorgeous comic graphics, some of the best digital soundtracks, memorable characters, intelligent and - most importantly - logical puzzles, witty dialogue, stories that are as good as your favorite movie and you couldn\\'t get stuck or die... well, you could die at one point in this game. The only replayvalue lies within the jokes and Monkey Island 2 gave me an overall better experience but this game is an absolute classic and should be played by everybody.

The Half Life series has always had critical acclaim and the sequels HL2, Ep1 and Ep2 are no different. These three games continue the story and the gameplay to one of the best PC FPS series ever created. While there are some minor downsides to the HL2 episodes in that their rather short gameplay length and lack of any new weaponry etc can come across as boring. The emotional story, intense action and constant improvements to the Source engine have caused the series to constantly improve upon itself. You can't call yourself a gamer, and definately a PC gamer, if you don't own the Half Life and Half Life 2 games.Portal is the little gem of this package. Its short single player campaign is a perfect mix of gameplay, puzzle solving and black humour in the form of the games antagonist, GLaDoS. An intuative game with a lot of inovation to make it stand out in a crowd. No other puzzle game has used portals as a method to solve said puzzles and no other game has managed to make such a concept so successfull. Definately a brilliant game and with the possibility of Mods for the PC version its well worth a look.Team Fortress 2 is probably the best piece of the Orange Box because of its online play. PC games are all about the online play and TF2 definately delivers a solid experience. The many classes in the game are well balanced and very unique, no two feel the same, and compliment one another well. Since release Valve have added achievements to both the Medic and Pyro class and intend to continue adding them for the other classes. If your into that sort of thing then TF2 is a big must, a lot of the achievements are challenging and yet highly amusing. Not to mention they in a way force players to try out other classes they may never have played before.Overall the Orange Box is quite possibly the best gaming package to ever be created. Five games for the price of one, five awesome games. If your a PC gamer then i suggest definately buying this as you really cant find a better deal or justify calling yourself a PC gamer when you dont own such an awesome array of games.\",\n",

Three different battle systems party, duel, and army.\\xa0\\xa0All characters have unique weapons which are sharpened at a blacksmith instead of buying new equipment. 108 Characters, most can be used in your party.Cons: Harder to find and costs more than most older games, army Vs army battles are extremely easy, music lacks in dungeons, all good things must eventually come to an end.Come my friends (people who will recommend this review) through my time traveling portal, back to the early days of the Playstation.StoryThe games story is based on a Chinese myth about 108 \"Stars of Destiny\" and how they.....well that\\'s all I remember about the myth. The game has you playing the role of a nameless hero (nameless because you need to name him) who is the son of the Scarlet Moon Empire\\'s greatest general. The game begins with your character following your father to the palace where you will attempt to follow in his footsteps. After taking your first few missions, with the help of a few family friends, your character begins to notice the corruption of the empire that you have come to serve. Events eventually lead you and your party to join a rebellion against the empire,\\xa0a sudden tragedy allows\\xa0you to\\xa0become the leader of the army.\\xa0It is then your job to find a suitable castle, recruit soldiers, and battle your characters own father to shape the destiny of the empire. I won\\'t reveal anymore of the story but it is still one of the best.GameplayOnce you acquire a castle you will travel the land to aid your army, seeking allies and trying to subdue or destroy the forces of the empire. As you gain new allies your castle will increase in size and have new features added to it such as a vault, armory, bath, a mage that can teleport you places you have already visited, and even an elevator as well as many others. You can eventually recruit characters that allow you to gamble your money playing different games. Your party can consist of six characters out of the 108 that you can recruit. Some characters have special \"unite\" attacks where two or more characters will attack together.All characters have a unique weapon that can get increased damage by taking it to a blacksmith to sharpen it or get a rune attached to it so it will have added magic damage. Although you will still have to use shops to buy items and armor. Weapons have different ranges L (Long, bows, thrown weapons) means that the character can attack in the front or back row of your party and can attack whoever he/she wants, M (Mid. Weapons include Staffs, pikes, spears, etc) can attack from anywhere but can only hit front row enemies, S (Short. Swords, axes, etc) can attack only from front row and can only hit front row. Characters can also attach a rune to themselves for magic and special attacks. Besides regular party battles there are also one on one duels that have three ways to attack. Attack which will always do normal damage. Defend which will half all damage or counter a desperate attack. The last is Desperate Attack which does twice as much damage but gets countered by a defend. You have to pay attention to what your opponent says to know what they will do.There are also army battles that all recruited characters take part in. You can use Charge, bow, and magic attacks. Charge beats bow, bow beats magic, and magic beats charge. There are also special things you can do like tell one of your ninjas or thieves to spy on the enemy to see what they will do next or to take a merchant or diplomat to try to get enemy units to change sides during the battle. In army battles recruited characters can get injured or die but if you know what you are doing the chances of that happening are slim to none.GraphicsThe game looks decent, though it never looked great. Remember that this came out over 10 years ago though.SoundThe soundtrack in this game is amazing. Music fits in perfectly with what is going on in cutscenes and story segments, however it seems to be lacking while inside dungeons and towns. ValueThe game is harder to find and might seem pricey if you do but I can assure you that it is worth it. Great story and good length.Personal OpinionSuikoden still stands as one of the best RPGs that I have ever played. ',\n",

As far as the story and other dramatic game elements go it is a straightforward game.However, there are noteworthy innovations to the conventional platform formula that refine the game to degree that defines Saboteur as its own kind of animal. Instead of side scrolling as a way to progress from one area to the next, the backgrounds remain static staying as one “screen”. When the character leaves one screen, he or she transitions onto a new screen. This makes the graphical aspect of the character’s stride seem more stealthy and nimble like one would expect a ninja’s stride to be.The game is graphically competent, but images on screen are not bound to mesmerize the player, as the numbers of colors that appear on screen are severely limited. The reason why this does not cripple the game’s quality is that the graphics are very stylistic in presentation and use the limited colors to complement the scheme. The sprite animations are full of detail and flowing continuity. Overall, Saboteur is above average when it comes to its graphical quality.The music and sound are the two lacking features that take away from the game. The sound effects sound more like they belong on a late 70’s pong 3-in-1 machine. Little effort shows in the short and dull sounds of gunshots, running, and environmental impact. Some aspects of the game, where one would expect a sound effect’s presence, tend to lack sound. Enemy guards who run and walk make no noise and the guard dogs also suffer from the lack of sound. In terms of music, there is no in-game music. There is a musical tune in the game’s main menu, but it isn’t a piece that is compelling nor will it complement the game, as it does not play during the game.The game’s difficulty is varied depending on what difficulty the player chooses. Settings aside, the game can go from easy going to intensely difficult in a few seconds for the main character’s health lessens at a quick pace when you take on damage. To contribute a little flexibility to the game the health system has an incremental regeneration mechanic. If the main character stands idle his or her health will slowly come back. It will not regenerate if you are ducking, running or fighting. The enemies consist of sentry turrets, guards and attack dogs. There are a couple of environmental hazards like water (drowning) and gravity (falling great distances).It is clear-cut that there are a bunch of great ideas in this game and since the game offers some innovative and refreshing game play, you won’t have to dig deep to find them. This game offers a new direction to which future platform adventure games can take as well as new ways to stylistically make games more visually compelling. Though the audio is nothing special, the rest that Saboteur has to offer compensates for that lacking feature. In the end Saboteur is a game experience that is most likely to attract most seasoned retro gamers looking for a good platform game that moves the genre in a different direction.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Order of the Phoenix has brought back the free roam elements that were missing from Goblet of Fire and now lets you roam around Hogwarts, which is fully re-created to include every room and corridor that you have seen in the film. That's all very well, but when the gameplay is mind-numbingly boring and repetitive, it makes you wonder why they bothered.You control all of the game as Harry (excluding the few minutes you play as Fred and George, Sirius and Dumbledore) and Ron and Hermione are just your sidekicks which follow you around and get in your way. As you go around Hogwarts you will encounter more students going about their daily routine (mainly giving Harry a bad reputation), which adds to the more people who can get in your way and sometimes seem to do it on purpose.The controls are configurable, but using the mouse to casts spells feels the most satisfying. To cast a spell you hold down the left button and move it either up, down, left to right and so on. You do the same thing in when in combat, except you hold down the right mouse button. However, controlling Harry is a real pain as he walks really slowly, causing you to hold down shift the whole time to make him run, which makes you wonder why shift wasn't just used for walking. If the camera has a sudden change of position, the key you were holding to move Harry in a certain direction suddenly makes Harry move in another direction, which is frustrating. There are also times where Harry has to slide along ledges, in which he moves extremely slowly on.So, let's go fight people, cast loads of exciting spells in exciting places and have really great fun! Or not. You press TAB to bring up the Marauder’s Map where you have to select someone to find and then do a task for them. This is mainly used for finding members for the DA, which takes up a big chunk of the game. What do you do when you find these people? Do tasks for them. They will have you swamping out courtyards, tipping potions into speakers (six times!), retrieving their cameras, finding Gargoyles or anything else like that. It may sound fun written down, but when you are playing it you will soon grow tired of the lack of excitement and how repetitive the game is coming. The only time you engage in combat (it's rare), it is boring and makes you want it to be over quickly.As you are now able to free roam around Hogwarts, it is superb at first to be in the places you saw in the films or imagined in the books, however you will soon have visited those places countless times and you will be wishing you didn't have to do all this running about. You can also unlock classrooms by doing tasks for the teachers, which although mentally rewarding, offers nothing new to the gameplay.You can earn points throughout the game by repairing statues, discovering trophies, putting paintings back on the wall and such. At a certain amount of points you will unlock rewards which can be found in a special room. The rewards are actually really good and a highlight - they are interviews with the makers of the game and the cast of Harry Potter, presented in a nice Daily Prophet (newspaper) style.There are cutscenes during the game which hold potential, but are put together really poorly. The voices don't match the movements of the mouth and some people in the cutscenes will just be standing there and not doing anything at all. There are also cutscenes for parts of the game you may have been looking forward to playing (flying to the Ministry of Magic, for instance). It's a shame really, because if some more time, effort and thought had been put into them they would have been a nice touch.The sound for this game is one of the good things. The original soundtrack has been used, and it makes you feel at Hogwarts when you hear other students talking or owls hooting in the distance. Quite a few of the original cast from the films have been used, and it's just a shame they couldn't use all of them.Graphically the game is strange. In some places you will be amazed by the detail that has gone into it, but you will mostly be put out by the poorly detailed characters and their clunky movements. It seems the developers got bored halfway through and decided to quickly make some textures and animations to get the job done quickly, especially when characters start vanishing for no apparent reason.To sum up, this game feels as if you are just doing chores for the students and not immersing in any magic or action at all. As I'm a big Harry Potter fan, this game is a real disappointment for anyone of any age. We can only hope that the Half Blood Prince game will turn out better.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'The Call of Duty series has been both at the top of the FPS pile, as well as near the bottom. Several console iterations of the popular WWII shooter have been sub-par to say the least, but console owners finally got a true port of the fantastic Call of Duty 2 back in 2005. The Infinity Ward developed game was then succeeded in 2006 by the dismal Call of Duty 3, this time developed by Treyarch. The poor quality of the game coupled with the saturation of WWII based games on the market was spelling disaster for the Call of Duty series, so despite Infinity Ward being at the helm once again for the 4th installment, I think it\\'s safe to assume that some, including myself, weren\\'t too excited for another sub-par WWII FPS effort.However, the geniuses at Infinity Ward have developed, much like the military itself, and advanced to deal with the changing consumer audience, and have made Call of Duty 4 about modern combat. The story in-game here isn\\'t the re-telling of any historic event, nor is it truly about current issues, but is in fact an act of fiction, while still maintaining a feel like such a story was plausible and all too eerily possible in this day and age.In Call of Duty 4, you\\'ll play as a couple of soldiers (and at least a couple more) in this modern age of combat. As British SAS member \"Soap\" McTavish, you\\'ll be aiding Russian Loyalists against Radicals trying to seize nuclear weapons to aid their allies in the middle east, and that\\'s where the other soldier you play as, US Marine, Paul Jackson, comes in, as a coup has occurred and hostile Opfor insurgents are taking control of the middle east, threatening hostility on the west for past grievances. There are more than a few twists in the games short, but explosive campaign, and though it could\\'ve used a few more missions to extend the experience, the story here is fantastic.The presentation behind this story is equally impressive. The scale and environments displayed in Call of Duty has always been impressive, and the character models and animations here are on par with the rest of the graphical design. Weapons look equally detailed and look nearly photo-realistic when being fired and reloaded, and explosions and gunfire is impactful and impressive looking.  This is accompanied by a soundtrack reminiscent of other Call of Duty efforts, but with a contemporary twang every now and then that really puts one into the mood that, \"hey, this is still a war game like usual, but apparently, war has changed\". Sound effects are spot on and make you feel right on the battlefield, and what voice acting is there, is fantastic and fits the rest of the stellar presentation.Finally, gameplay. This is a Call of Duty game, and is therefore, has some of the most solid shooting in any FPS, but like other Infinity Ward games, also throws in a multitude of varying objectives and means to complete those objectives so you\\'re really not feeling like you\\'re doing the same thing throughout the game\\'s short campaign, as you\\'ll snipe, call in for air support, and even man the guns of an airship at one point or another. It\\'s an FPS, but it\\'s one of the most balanced out FPS\\'s to date, with the right amount of immersion, action, story, and varying objectives to keep the audience riveted. And this doesn\\'t even tough on...Multiplayer. Perhaps the games most surprising and addictive aspect is it\\'s highly competitive multiplayer. Although all the standard FPS modes are here, the solidity of the game shines through to the multiplayer, and unique aspects like the ability to create your own class, customize weapons, and calling in for support during the game\\'s several modes makes it a truly unique experience that sets itself apart while still providing a huge amount of replay value to the game.With a briskly paced campaign and endless replay value entailed in its multiplayer, Call of Duty 4 is a game that is easily recommendable to anybody.\\xa0 Though the 5th installment is looking to be a return to mediocrity, one can only hope the next Infinity Ward offering will be as good, if not better than this.',\n",

       "  'description': \"There are times when a game can transcend the controller and just bring you in to a far away land like no other media can. The epic story, sound and\\xa0scale of Shadow of the Colossus combine to create a one of a kind experience in videogames. This is definetely one game that is worth playing from the Playstation 2 era even in the\\xa0times of HD graphics and online multiplayer. This game's story delivers a beautiful tale, even if the premise seems very ordinary. You are a person who goes to this land at the ends of the Earth to try and convince ancient spirits to resurrect a maiden who was sacrificed. While it never is made clear what connection she has to you, it is probably love, as why else would some one agree to do what you do in this game. The spirits agree to help you but only if you kill the SIXTEEN colossi roaming the land. After you go through the first few colossi, it becomes almost daunting to see this almost ordinary guy climbing these creatures the size of a small skyscraper and killing them just so you can see the girl alive again. I say almost ordinary because not only does he have a special sword that can not only damage the colossi and reflect light to tell you where they are, but something happens to him after each battle that ends up changing him in the end. The colossi are also some of the most inventive enemies in games. The designs\\xa0range from animals to soldiers to even buildings themselves. All of these battles are backed up by a musical score more atmospheric and beautiful than most Hollywood movies. The orchestral music adds emotion to the battles, things like tension, anger and fear. The atmosphere of this game would almost not be there if it weren't for its music. As for gameplay, the controls take some getting used to. That doesn't mean they're bad, but the button placement is different and it can be a little confusing in the first hour or so of the game. Luckily, it becomes second nature very fast. If there was one con that this game had, it would be the graphics. The landscapes and the colossi are ver well designed and have an artistic feeling to them, but because of the scale of the game, smaller parts of the game (your character) look very polygonal. It does seem like a nitpick, but the PS2 has seen better graphics. Graphics issues can be forgiven though because the game does everything else so well. In the end, this game is a must play for adventure fans and fans of games in general. I higly recommend it to anyone wanting an original experience not just from the PS2, but from games in general. 5 stars.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Back in 1993, LucasArts released a game involving a dog and rabbit crime solving duo. With its humour and story, the game was a hit, so imagine fan's delight when LucasArts announced in 2002 that they were releasing a new Sam and Max adventure, this time in 3D. Then imagine the disappointment when LucasArts cancelled the title. In fact, you don't need to imagine it - there was a petition put online that over 32,000 people signed. Luckily Telltale acquired the license and is now bringing out Sam and Max games in an episodic format.The story is that three '70s former child stars called the Soda Poppers seem to have gone into some kind of trance and now worship another former child star, Brady Culture, who has released a video on eye exercising tapes called Eye-Bo. The Soda Poppers love Brady Culture so much that they have taken to spray painting his face on walls and sneaking his videos into the local store. It is now up to Sam and Max to figure out what is going on and what Brady Culture is up to...The interface is fairly simply. You click to where you want Sam and Max to move to and you can interact with someone or something by clicking it. Your inventory is displayed in a cardboard box at the bottom left hand side of the screen. The inventory is fairly simple however, as you cannot mix items together and there is only a limited amount of objects you can have in it. This makes solving the puzzles in the game slightly easier, but this could either be a good or bad thing, depending on how challenging you like your adventure games.There are some hilarious moments in Culture Shock that are really well written, but are given a boost by the excellent voice acting from all the cast. The Soda Popper's voices are really funny and you will be laughing at lines they say which weren't even meant to be jokes. The only downside to the voices is that it isn't great quality and it is a bit rough round the edges at times.Graphically the game isn't the most detailed possible, but it fits the style of the comic book roots Sam and Max came from. The animations on the characters are done well as all of it is smooth with no jumps from one action to another. There is also a jazz soundtrack which fits well to the detective side of the dog and rabbit.Sam and Max Episode 1: Culture Shock is an excellent introduction for what's to come and although the ending wraps up nicely, will have you screaming for more. The game is the first of six downloadable games; however people may not like having to download games, so luckily all six episodes that make up Season 1 are now available on disc. Culture Shock is a great game and is really good value for money so you should really play this game long-time Sam and Max fan or not.\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots',\n",
       "  'description': 'The Metal Gear Solid games have been one of the honored franchise’s in the video game industry. Starting with Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, both for the MSX2, the gameplay was like nothing anyone has ever done. Instead of running left to right, shooting everything in your path, you would try sneak your way through the game killing nothing if you were good. This awesome gameplay was carried through all of the next games in the series like Metal Gear Solid for the Playstation, and the sequels: MGS 2: Sons of Liberty, and MGS 3: Snake Eater for the Playstation 2. Some of the gameplay however, started to become dated by the time of Snake Eater. Every game, though set in different times and locations, all revolve around one core story that becomes more and more confusing as time rolls on. Sadly, the series eventually has to come to a close, and even though it’s as satisfying as ever, you are always sad to see the series have its final chapter. This final chapter is Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of Patriots, and is easily the best Metal Gear Solid game, and one of the best games I have ever played.\\xa0Metal Gear Solid 4 is the exclusive game that Playstation 3 owners have been waiting for. Uncharted was good, and Ratchet and Clank was okay, but Metal Gear Solid 4 just blows both of them away in the production values, the overall feel, and just the game as a whole. There are many elements of the game, more than just the graphics, that will just make your jaw drop in awe. Metal Gear Solid 4 really is the ultimate Metal Gear game, from start ti finish. The sneaking is still here, and made even better with new gameplay elements like the Octocamo, which lets Snake blend into any surface by leaning against it, and the Solid Eye that uses different functions like Night Vision and a Scope. Enemies have also change, and now will sometimes be fighting in a war while you sneak around them. They can still be alerted however, and the game is overall harder to escape when in the alert phase than previous game, making you never wanting to get alerted. There are also new types of enemies. One type are called Haven Troopers, they’re a new enhanced female soldier that can jump and latch onto walls, and jump around like frogs. The other new enemy is the GEKKO, that is like a miniature Metal Gear, but it’s half organic, half synthetic.\\xa0Like past Metal Gear Solid games, you will probably see more cutscenes than actual gameplay, and it’s no different here, and is actually more frequent in MGS4 than in past Metal Gear Solid games. Most of the cutscenes are never boring however, and they usually just throw information at you over and over again, which is pretty awesome, and are sometimes filled with some pretty sweet action sequences. Everything is also rendered in real time, so cutscenes will end unexpectedly when you start playing as Snake while the action is still going on. In Metal Gear Solid 4, there are different acts that take place in different locations. Each location has it’s own mission briefing before the gameplay begins, and this is where the length of the cutscenes come into play. At the end of chapter 3 for example, there’s a 15 to 20 minute cutscene, then a mission briefing that is up to 40 minute long, then another cutscenes at the beginning of the 4th chapter. Sometimes it can feel like the cutscenes are too long, but if a fan of the story, you’ll need to pay attention in order to understand. Cutscenes are also interactive, sometimes a button will flash on the screen like L1 or X to look in first person, or view a flashback. Because the cutscenes are so long, pausing the cutscenes may need to be done, and you can in MGS4 by pressing the start button. Skipping is also done with this method, but you have to select “Skip” on the pause menu in order to do it.\\xa0The story is straight-up concluded in MGS4. Writing about the story for a Metal Gear Solid game in a review is very difficult without giving away any spoilers, so I will keep the story telling to a minimum, but all I can say is that Metal Gear Solid 4 easily has the greatest gaming story I have ever experience. Any confusion about anything in the series is talked about from the origin of Big Boss, to the Les Enfants Terribles Project, to just about every character like Raiden, EVA, Naomi, Ocelot, Meryl, and yes, Otacon. New character are introduced in MGS4 like Sunny, the daughter of Olga from MGS2 and is a whiz at computers and technology, Drebin and his little Monkey friend named Little Gray. Drebin’s an arms dealer that can sell guns to Snake, and can release the lock off certain weapons you collect throughout the game. Each gun you collect has an ID Code attached to it, meaning that only the soldier that was holding it can shoot it. Drebin can get rid of these locks for you, but it can only be done for a small price. You will earn Drebin points by collecting weapons off downed enemies, and once you finish a chapter you will be rewarded with points for killing as many soldiers as possible, or not using any healing items.\\xa0Attacking enemies in past MGS games have usually been a hassle. You either had to see Snake from above, or you would have to aim in first person. In Metal Gear Solid 4, you can now aim over-the-shoulder, and fight your way through enemies this way which a huge step forward in the franchise. You can also do the classic first-person aiming by pressing the triangle button while aiming, but after playing with the shoulder view, the first person mode is only good for sniping. The camera is also manipulative, so you can now see all around you instead of having to aim in first-person to see what’s next. The map is still a necessity however, but while looking at it in the pause menu, you can press the triangle button to see the map in 3D, making the area more accurate.\\xa0Past Metal Gear games have always had memorable boss fights throughout the game, and MGS4, it is no different. Most MGS games have a squad of bosses to fight over the course of the campaign, the squad in Guns of the Patriots is called the Beauty and the Beast Corps consisting of 4 beautiful females that are still tortured from their brutal past. Laughing Octopus, Raging Raven, Crying Wolf, and Screaming Mantis all consist of a trait that they can’t stop to do while they kill. Laughing Octopus laughs while she kills her enemies, Raging Raven kills her enemies with Anger, Crying Wolf cries whiles she tears apart her foes, and Screaming Mantis screams like mad while she controls her opponents with her mind. All of the beauties seem to have a strange resemblance while they fight to old bosses from past Metal Gear games. Screaming Mantis for example, fights extremely similar to Psycho Mantis of FOXHOUND from Metal Gear Solid for the Playstation. All of the boss fights are extremely epic, having you fighting not only the bosses, but also other soldiers and machines at the same time.\\xa0Remember the end of Metal Gear Solid 3, when you’re on EVA’s motorcycle going through the forest killing as many enemies as you can? Yeah, those are in MGS4 too. What the really impressive thing about them however, is the variety, and the fast intense action they possess. One of them for example, has zombie-like soldiers climbing on the vehicle trying to attack you while you’re shooting your way through hoards of GEKKO.\\xa0If you haven’t seen Metal Gear Solid 4 in action, it is a must, because it is easily one of the best looking games ever made. The environments arrange from the Middle East, to the forest areas of South America, to even a nostalgic area for series veterans. All of it looks real. Every building have their own unique look, some with bricks falling off, some decaying from age, and some being eroded by plants. The characters models are some of the best yet, with all of the characters having unique looks with facial features down the the wrinkles on their face, and the strands of hair on their body. The lighting is also top notch, making everything look even nicer, and making the day areas like the Middle East look as real as ever. There are even weather effects, like walking through a snow storm at one point in the game, Snake will have snow build up on his mustache, and seeing through the storm is almost impossible. The frame rate is also flawless, never dropping even in the most intense of moments making the game silky smooth no matter what you’re doing.\\xa0As with everything else in Metal Gear Solid 4, the audio is perfect. From the voice acting, to the incredible sounds of the guns and explosions, to the amazing soundtrack, everything is top of the line. David Hayter does another amazing job of the voice of Snake with all of grunts and screams the series is known for. Don’t worry, all of the other characters like Naomi (Jennifer Hale), Ocelot (Patric Zimmerman), Octacon (Christopher Randolph), Meryl (Debi Mae West) and Raiden (Quinton Flynn) have the same actors and actresses from past games, so no one will sound differently. The soundtrack will again give you chills because it is as epic as ever. Even the ending credits song will make you want to just cry because of the quality and the originality of the music. The overall quality of the audio is really just astonishing, and mixed with the graphics, Metal Gear Solid 4 is one of the best built games of all time.\\xa0Even with everything being as close to perfect as possible, there are still some annoyances worth noting. First of all, before each chapter, the game installs the whole chapter onto your PS3 to reduce the length of load times, so you are going to have wait for it to install instead of changing the disk. It usually doesn’t take very long, mostly around 2 to 3 minutes, but it can get annoying after a while, especially when someone on your PS3 is playing the beginning of the game, and you’re at the end. The controls can also get pretty confusing, especially if you’re at the start of the game, but you usually get used to it after a while. Series vets wont have any problems with the story, but newcomers to the franchise will have no idea what is happening. Other than that, the game is absolutely perfect in every way.\\xa0Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots also comes packed in with the online portion of MGS4: Metal Gear Online. MGO is a squad based, 16-player online game where you can play a regular deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture mission, rescue mission, base mission, and a sneaking mission. The only modes that sway from the norm are Rescue, where one team tries to protect a certain object, while the other team tries to capture it, and Sneaking mission where someone plays as Snake and the Mk. II, and the other two teams fight each other while trying to avoid Snake from killing you. Adding Online to the package wasn’t a necessity, but a great addition none-the-less. The only downside to MGO is actually playing it because playing the same way you play the single player doesn’t go well when playing against actual humans. The set-up is also tedious having you set up two login ID’s for god knows why, and the overall feel of the game is clumsy.\\xa0There’s just so much of the game that revolves around the story still to talk about, but without giving it away, this is the best that can be done. But with that said, I can’t stress it enough: Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots is one of the best games I have ever played, period. Games can tend to have too much hype by the time of release to live up to, but Metal Gear Solid 4 not only lives up to said hype, but absolutely crushes it. Games like Ocarina of Time are remembered for its timeless gameplay and a slick transition into 3D, and some games like Resident Evil 4 are remembered for flipping itself over and starting fresh, but Metal Gear Solid 4 will be remembered for the amazing conclusion to one of the best franchises in the industry, and flat-out being one of the very best games ever produced. It’s simply flawless.',\n",

Although you can play this game by itself, you may not understand a line or two that relates to another episodes. The game also gives the feel that there is going to be one, big interlocking storyline throughout the season, so for the full experience it is probably best to play through in numerical order.In Situation: Comedy Sam and Max have to try and stop a talkshow host called Myra Stump. She has been running her show non-stop for days and wont let her audiance go. It is now up to Sam and Max to drive over to the TV station and stop this. Of course Myra isn't going to let you just barge in there, so you have to get three items which all can be found on the other sets in the TV station. You have to star in a sitcom (which if you don't know where you're meant to be going with it, can get repetitive), trying and nab a recording contract on a singing show (hosted by two of the Soda Poppers and Max) and try and win a million dollars on a gameshow. You can of course still visit Sybil, Bosco and your office to help you solve the puzzles, but the downside here is that a lot of the lines are recycled.The game still goes strong with its genually funny humour and characters, especially Hugh Bliss. The graphics still remain good and the jazzy music (as well as some new stuff for the new sets) remains in the game, which is good to know. Max also has a new voice, but luckily you can hardly notice, if at all. The TV sets are well designed are there are some neat touches here and there which will bring out a smile.The fact this game is recycling characters and locations does knock off a few marks from the overall score, but not enough to make this game not playable, because the fact is you'll be spending more time in the new environments and listening to the new lines anyway. A must buy if you purchased and liked the previous game.\",\n",

You will also be familiar with the things Sam and Max say when you click on objects and you'll be left wondering why some new lines weren't recorded. The fact this is so repetitive detracts from the experience of the game, including the fact The Mole, the Mob and the Meatball is the shortest game so far.The main plot of the game is that a police mole has gone undercover in Ted E. Bear's Mafia and it is up to Sam and Max to figure out what has happened. The humour that you've come to love over the season is still intact and there are some great moments such as the singing bear heads on the wall. Sadly though, there are only a couple new places to visit which means more backtracking and a shorter game which is never a good thing. But don't be put off - this is still a good game.The puzzles in the game remain fairly easy to solve if you are an adventure game veteran, but this doesn't mean it is still an enjoyable experience. You will have fun beating Leonard Steakcharmer at his own game and then questioning him with a series of 'Yo mamma' jokes, as well as setting a bug on people who will then crawl back and tell you what he's heard, complete with that character's voice. Graphically the game is still going strong and the sound is great, especially the singing bears as mentioned.More of the overall plot is now starting to seep through and if you've got this far in the season you should play on, if only to find out what happens at the end. The fact this episode is shorter than the other two is a bit of a letdown, but the games are still good value for money and you obviously shouldn't be expecting a full 40 hour game for what you are paying for. It's just a shame about the recycled lines.\",\n",

This installment is by far the best one I've played. Both the campaign and Multiplayer are superb.   The campaign is very, very short. It only took me about 5 hours to beat the game on the first day I got it. Although the campaign is short, it's so much fun I just couldn't put it down. You'll find yourself playing for hours on end because you just won't get bored of it. Once you finish it you can always try for a harder difficulty and It really makes you play differently, especially on veteran. Although this does make the game a little more frustrating. The Arcade mode is a spin on the campaign as well that adds some re-playability.  The multiplayer is great as well. I've put over 22 hours into it so far. The ranks make you feel like your accomplishing something in every game while still having a lot of fun. It feels similar to being addicted to an RPG. You just want to keep playing because every second not playing is a second wasted.  If you don't have Xbox live then you're probably better off just renting this one. The single player is good enough to have you coming back but it's just too short to make you want to buy it. On the other hand if you have live it could easily be the best multiplayer you've played all year. Making it a must buy. Regardless this is a game you wont want to pass up if your a fan of shooters.\",\n",

But the thing is that you forgive that in this episode because of the best story in season so far, the best locations and... well, the best everything so far! The 'hypnotic' story that lies beneath the season is really coming through now, so fans of the games will want to play through to the finale episode now.The story and locations in this game are the most interesting yet. The president of the United States has gone a bit loopy, with federally mandated group hugs, a pudding embargo and other crazy things. It is now down to Sam and Max to stop the president! But this isn’t' really the main plot of the game, as that is solved pretty early on. Instead, something else happens which is a really nice turn in the story and pieces things together from previous episodes.This episode has you starting off in the White House, but after a bit of exploring and talking to some characters, you'll drive straight back to the office in search for clues to proceed you in the episode. It's nice to be able to start somewhere different for once, but you'll be going back and forth from the two places quite a lot which is tiresome. Luckily the puzzles in the game are harder than before, but still remain possible without having to try really stupid things like some adventure games make you do (which some people find fun, but others find overly frustrating). The voice acting and graphics are still up to high standards and there are some really well done sequences such as the War Song. Abe Lincoln Must Die! has bought the standards up to that of the first game and now that more and more of the story is slowly piecing together, it looks like the games to come and going to be even better.\",\n",

A pair of virtual-reality goggles that lets you into a massively multiplayer online game called Reality 2.0 is the hypnotic device this time around. The enemy? The internet. Reality 2.0 is the best game in the season so far, if only for its genius storyline.The problem with the last two episodes is that the speech and environments were being reused over and over. Telltale have now listened to their fans and have recorded fresh new dialogue for this game when you click on things in places like the office and Bosco's store, which although not exactly the biggest feature, really does make the game more enjoyable to play through.Reality 2.0 is exactly the same as reality (hence the title), but in a digital world. This means you'll get to visit familiar places such as Bosco and Sybil's in reality and in its virtual counterpart. Puzzles have to be solved by getting items from each version of the location, which makes them more interesting. The puzzles are also slightly more challenging then they have been before, which fans have been asking for. You will also meet people you've met in previous games in the virtual reality world, which is neat.This time the humour is at its best. There are some really great nods to certain things, such as when you have to have a fight with some slime or when you find out what Bosco is doing in the virtual world. You have to take your hat off to the voice actors who have retained such brilliance throughout the whole season.Sam and Max: Reality 2.0 is the best game of the season so far and has set a high level to beat for the next episode, which will obviously hold some big secret or revelation regarding the hypnotic storyline. Sam and Max Season 1 has certainly been a good season so far, but Reality 2.0 makes it even better.\",\n",

Using a combination of an amazing Story, addicting game play mechanics And a nice visual presentation, Star Control 2 offers an experience that even today has fans crying out for a sequel.  You begin this game returning to Earth from a distant colony that has been separated from outside news for some amount of years. Upon returning to Earth, you find that the Humans, and the rest of the Alliance of Free Stars, didn\\'t fare so well against the Ur-Quan and they\\'re \"Battle Thralls\". Now behind an Impenetrable Slave Shield, All of humanity (save you and the Starbase in orbit) is trapped on they\\'re own planet. The Goal of the game at first is to free Earth... But that goal will expand later on.  Throughout the game, you\\'ll find yourself mining resources for new ships, making Friends and enemies with the neighboring Aliens and Fighting in Ship to Ship Combat, All while trying to complete your objective of saving the Universe from the Ur-Quan.  The Aliens in this game, while maybe not original or realistic, each have a ton of back-story and play their stereotypes really well. You\\'ll find stereotypes of just about every culture or mindset that immediately comes to mind, and the English voice acting of\\xa0 \"The Ur-Quan Masters\" Remake works very well for all of them.The Ur-quan themselves have got to be one of the greatest villians of any Game... Ever. After you get to know the unique history of they\\'re race, and the motivation that drives them, you find yourself wondering: \"Maybe they are right! maybe we should all be inslaved\" Thankfully, that thought probbaly wont stop you from ripping them to pieces.The Sound and Music in this game are... adequete. Nothing special about it, but everything works well. However, The \"Ur-Quan Masters\" remake that was released includes some good Fanmade remixes of the musical score making for an even greater experience.Combat is a simple addicting Top-Down space shooter. You get a Primary and Secondary weapon for each ship, and have to move around with simplistic space physics. The Opposing AI is prone to some \"cheap\" tactics, as forcing them into colliding with the planet, or using \"Spathi-Fu\" (Just running away and using the Spathi\\'s reverse firing secondary).Eventually, your flagship becomes a little too powerful, and you have no reason to use any of the other ships... definitly a bad point in the balancing of this game.All in all, an excellent game that suffers from a few shortcommings due to the Small staff and presumably small budget.',\n",

Everything you've come to expect from the season is here; funny jokes, interesting storylines and brilliant voice acting. This game wraps up all the loose ends in the story line and does it really well.In the final game you get to find out who has been hypnotising everyone (early on in the game) and you must travel to the moon in your trusty Desoto to stop this evil person!

There are some great new locations (obviously, since you're on the moon!) and the voice acting and graphics remain the high quality you've received through the previous episodes. The puzzles are harder than previous episodes, but not in the way that'll have you slamming your mouse against your desk and screaming for mercy. The final puzzle of the game is frustrating, however. You have a chance to figure out the puzzle, but if you don't figure it out you'll just keep going around in an annoying loop - you'll understand if you play it.Overall, Sam and Max Season 1 has been an enjoyable experience and one that any respectable adventure gamer will not want to miss out on.

       "  'description': 'When Metroid Prime was released in 2002, critics and fans said \"a game like this only comes around every once in a while\". Based on the enormous gap between Super Metroid and Metroid Prime, they had a point. However, Retro Studios has proven that lightning can strike twice, and it can strike quickly. Metroid Prime 2: Echoes improves upon everything at which its predecessor excelled. Namely: atmosphere, music, puzzles, and combat.A hallmark of the Metroid series is the eerie atmosphere in which the games take place, even on rudimentary consoles like the NES and GameBoy, the games conveyed a sense of loneliness and apprehension. The question that the player always asks is \"what\\'s in the next room?\" \"Peril\" is the answer each game provides. Metroid Prime 2: Echoes is no different. The visual fidelity is superb -- especially in progressive scan mode -- there is little aliasing, the textures are rich, the world manages to be colourful and dark at the same time, the creatures move and act believably, and the environments have a nice level of variety. From the surreal view of planet Aether from space at the outset, to the first time Samus steps into the Dark World and beyond, the designers grab you, shake you, and ask \"Are you woman enough to survive?!\"That\\'s right, much like The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Metroid Prime 2 takes place in two worlds: Dark and Light, each being an \"echo\" of the other. This device adds layers of atmosphere, and the differences and similarities between the two are equally palpable. It also adds new gameplay forms with regard to puzzles and combat: The creatures in the Dark World are twisted abominations of those found in the Light World, they\\'re also generally more difficult to defeat. What exactly they are and how they came to be is best left for the well-told story, and unspoiled by your reviewer.Audio continues to be one of the keystones to the success of Metroid games with Echoes\\' soundtrack. New pieces and even more remixes of old favourites omitted from the prequel add to the level of immersion. The music always goes well with the environment and situation it\\'s chosen for, and add tension to the segments that demand it, and add a creepy serenity to the less action-packed parts. The sound effects for Samus\\' weapons and equipment add the necessary punch to fully immerse you in the mysterious world of Aether. Sounds of machinery and equipment collapsing, exploding, colliding, and functioning all sound believable.One of the less noticeable aspects of video games is lighting. Most often, it sticks out when it\\'s bad, and it goes unmentioned when done well. Metroid Prime had great lighting, but once again, Echoes manages to exceed it in every way. From the lights generated by certain creatures, to the absorption of light from dark objects and weapons, the game\\'s lighting is truly outstanding.Metroid Prime 2 has its share of puzzles, and great variety and challenge therein, with new functionality to the boost ball in conjunction with the spider ball, there are many more possibilities, and Retro was sure to exploit most, if not all of them. There are particular puzzles that stand out in this reviewer\\'s mind, but they\\'re even better when they are surprises, so details are being purposely avoided.The same goes for bosses: Every single full boss, and most of the mini-bosses manage to exceed, in terms of inventiveness and difficulty, each of the bosses in every other Metroid game. Metroid games are known for their boss-fights, but they all pale in comparison to those found in Echoes. The game is worth replaying just for the boss-fights!Retro Studios is batting a thousand, both of their games have been top-notch, and they manage to improve upon the things that their first game did extremely well. If you\\'re trying to find the best GameCube game, the best Metroid game, or the best game of this generation; look no further.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Rock Band. Who hasn\\'t heard of it by now? The premise is simple: you and three buddies can get together, and rock out on two fake guitars, a fake drum set, and a USB microphone to over 50 songs included on the disc, most of which are the master tracks. Some people may mock the game, and for good reason; anybody looks like an idiot while trying to windmill the guitar on The Who\\'s \"Won\\'t Get Fooled Again\", or busting into crazy drum fills whenever possible on Iron Maiden\\'s \"Run To The Hills\". But these moments are some of the best in Rock Band; moments where you can have a good laugh with three friends, and just act plain silly while creating Rock Fusion™.If you\\'ve ever played Guitar Hero, another well-made rhythm game, then you should be familiar with Rock Band\\'s guitar and bass gameplay. A stream of notes falls down the screen, divided into three, four, or five different colors, determined by the difficulty level you\\'ve chosen. On Easy, green, red, and yellow notes stream by at a slow pace. You have to hold down the correspondingly-colored buttons on your plastic guitar, and strum the \"strum bar\", which emulates the area where you strum the strings on a real guitar.On Medium, it introduces the blue button, and a faster stream of notes, as well as more notes that you have to play. On Hard and Expert, the orange button comes into play, as well as increasingly-faster note tracks, with more notes to hit.Playing the drums is quite similar to playing guitar or bass, in that you have five different notes to hit: four pads, and a bass pedal for orange lines on the note track. It has been noted by many people that this makes the drums much harder to play than guitar or bass, as you have to use a foot as well as two hands to play them.The singing element in Rock Band is a lot like singing on a karaoke machine; words speed across the screen with a bar indicating the pitch of the word, and you must sing the word while matching the pitch. This can be one of the best or most frustrating parts of Rock Band; singing classics like Deep Purple\\'s \"Highway Star\" and Blue Öyster Cult\\'s \"(Don\\'t Fear) The Reaper\" is amazing, especially if you\\'re doing well. But there\\'s the catch. If you have a deep or otherwise less-than-great voice, then it\\'s hard to match the pitch of some songs, even when it seems like you\\'re singing them like they should be. Rock Band does a good job of offering diverse difficulty levels on this, though, and singing a song on Easy is just as fun as singing it on Expert.So, we\\'ve covered the instruments. But what happens when you\\'re playing as a group?The answer is simple; you play like you would if you were playing a song by yourself, but one to three other people are doing it as well on their own instruments. If Bob is playing guitar, and he misses a note, that note won\\'t be heard, and he\\'ll probably drop down a notch on the bar at the left of the screen, which tells you how well you\\'re doing and how much the crowd is into your song. If Bob decides to suddenly stop playing, then he\\'ll continue to lower the meter until he starts playing again, or he \"fails\" the song, which happens when his own particular symbol in the bar hits the bottom.You could then \"save\" Bob by activating Overdrive, which is another meter, but this time there\\'s one for everybody. You collect Overdrive by hitting sequences of notes(or words, for the vocalist) which then partially fills the meter. After collecting several of these, you can then activate Overdrive, which will \"save\" any \"failed\" bandmate, and also give you a rather nice multiplier, giving you more points per note.Which brings us to the score. Every time a band member hits a note, they gain points for that note, which are then increased by any multiplier they have, and then the points are thrown into a total score for the song. At the end of the song, the total score is displayed, as well as \"stars\", or how well the song was performed.Rock Band doesn\\'t come without faults, though. While the core gameplay is stellar, the interface before you even get into a song is clunky. Any songs that have been unlocked are seemingly linked to the unlocker\\'s profile, so if you don\\'t have that person in your band, you\\'re out of luck. Getting the band set up before playing is a major hassle, and if it were any other game, it would probably break it. But, it\\'s Rock Band, and the fun the comes from playing with three other people more than compensates for the interface.In the end, Rock Band is an excellent game, and well worth the steep price.',\n",

       "  'description': 'There are currently four games made by Nintendo for their systems that are based on training your brain - three for the DS and one for the Wii (this being Big Brain Academy: Wii Degree). Although each title is fun to play, the same problem remains throughout all of them; the game just doesn\\'t last long. You\\'ll play it for a month and then you\\'ll get bored of it and leave it to gather dust.This doesn\\'t mean they aren\\'t fun games. In fact, Big Brain Academy: Wii Degree has to be the best title so far. The game is set in a school environment and makes good use of your Miis. The menu screen is a hallway and it has you Miis wandering about, which you can then press to make them jump. Although it isn\\'t ground breaking stuff, neat touches like this make the game a joy to play.The test is broken down into six categories, each for different parts of the brain. In each category is three games, totalling to eighteen games in total, which isn\\'t very many at all. During the test your Wii Remote speaker will be shouting encouragement at you, such as \"good job!\" or \"keep it up!\". After the test your brain will be weighed, which is determined on how well you did, and you will be given a score.There is also a mode which lets you practice each of the games individually at varying difficulties in which you will be awarded a medal afterwards depending on how well you\\'ve done. Your scores can be sent via the Nintendo WiFi system to all your friends, so you can compare them in hope of having the biggest brain.The game also has three multiplayer activates, but two of these involve passing the remote which is never really a good thing. The game that involves two remotes is probably the best, too - the screen is split down the middle and each player will be given games they have to work their way through, and the person who completes all the games first wins. Other modes involve doing one game at a time and trying to get the highest score and going as long as you can. These two modes feature a few games that aren\\'t in the single player modes, which is a shame because they are quite good.The music and sound effects in the game are nice, and fit into the style of the game. Overall, the game is fun while it lasts and is good to have a quick play on with your friends, but you will get bored of the game within time.',\n",

       " {'deck': 'Wow GTA IV is a masterpiece.... or is it',\n",
       "  'description': \"Well of course it is!. So GTA IV is properly the most hyped game ever but has it lived up to it? Well i can easily answer that with yes. This game is amaing in every way and has successfully done things which other games haven't even tried or been successful at doing. Im not just talking about one thing im talking about a lot things so....GTA IV story. Thats a 10/10. The story is this one is better then other GTA games. You begin as Niko Bellic just coming from easten Europe to America to live the 'Amercian dream' like his cousin Roman. Howveer when he arrives his cousin turns out to be not rich and Niko comes to a grotty apartment. So form here your first few missions are from your cousin seeing as he's the only person you know but then you meet new people and we learn more about why Niko has come to liberty city.... the missions in this game are more varied given mutiple options as to whether you kill someone or not which affects the story later on, the actual missions are longer and more challenging as well. the main part will last you way longer then in other GTA games. One of the biggest additions is the mobile phone which Niko has this can be used to access mutiplayer and call contatcs to get work, whether that be main missions or side missions you can recive texts and even customise your ring tone and other cool stuff. You can also play through a SIXAXIS tutorial which lets you use the control to drive and reload (ha ha 360).the gameplay in GTAIV is amazing. Its like other GTA games except with a hell of a lot of additions which just make it so much better. The mian one been the cover system, which lets Niko blind fire jump put and shoot a bit like Uncharted drakes fortune, howver this can be a bit glitchy at times, keep playing around with it ull see what i mean. on this game you can still have girlfriends and buy new clothes although not as many available in san andreas theres still enough. You can also use internet cafes to go on the internet and check e-mails. Ammunation and pay n sprays are still present but arent as easy to use on this game becuase you can't enter ammunation with a wanted level and to use pay n sprays you have to go in without been spotted by the police. in ammunation instead of side scorlling and aselcting the weapon like in previous games you can walk up to the model and examine it before decing to buy it. The graphics in GTA IV are amaing and look great compared to previous games. liberty city really feels alive with dust bins out on the streets to tramps in allayways. The game looks great close up and far away objects thanks to the PS3 hardware. The NPC's look great with none of them looking similar and all do realistic things such as talk on mobiles eat, and use cash machines. One bad thing about graphics though is the trees. everything looks great excpet the trees they look like rubbish PS1 style graphics. Next time your on the game go up to one and look at one you will see what i mean. The sound on GTA IV again is supurb with the radio stations making a return. There are 14 in this game filled with great and modern tracks, if you listen carefully you can even hear Queen!! The voice acting is brillant and it should be with the amount of dialogue in the game, although one guy (little jacob) i can't actually never understand him. guns and cars sound great just like they should do. sound gets 10/10 as there is nothing wrong with it.The car handling is much more realistic in this game (as are a lot of things) and at first takes some getting used to but when you do its great.the drive by shooting has been imporvbed so instead of shooting directly left or right you can now shoot 360 degrees. You can do various activites such as bowling, pool, and darts which is great to kill some time and fun.GTAIV will last you a heck of a time. The story lasts for ages but if you want to go for 100% well thats even better. there a lot of side missions to do like with previous games Unquie jumps make a return and as for hidden packages there are now 200 pigeons (or 'flying rats') to shoot. Mutiplayer in GTAIV is amazing and can be up to 16 players. the city still looks the same and the gameplay is the same the only thing thats changed it that you in liberty city causing havok with 15 other people. The variety of modes and ranking system make it addictive, you don't have to be blowing the hell out of each other as there are co op style modes as well.To sum up here are the bad points about the game and why it didnt get a perfect 10. The tree graphics just spoils it sometimes. the fact that there are no planes it a letdown. In mutiplayer sometimes there are animation issues. These small things are nothing to the amount of goodness in thsi game but it does stop it from been perfect.Basically though if you do have a next gen console then get this game, you won't be dissappointed trust me...\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Fable is a 3rd person Action/RPG game, set in the fictional\\xa0world of Albion. It's created by English Game producer Lionhead studios, and is part of the Fable franchise. In the game, you control a dynamically morphing player, which depends on whether you do good things (e.g: killing Bandits) or evil things (e.g killing wnadering traders). You never have any direct control of the morphing, but it's not hard to be either good or bad. Eating too\\xa0much will make you fat, whilst not eating will make you shrink. You can also get absolutley wasted, even to the point of vomiting. You do get control of hairstyles and tatoos, though. You gain expirence by killing\\xa0enemies and completing certain tasks, which, in turn, affect your alignment. The experience orbs dropped by enemies can be traded at the Guild of Heroes for either Spells, Skills, or Strength. You see what they did there? It's called alliteration.\\xa0You can also upgrade each criteria up to a maximum of five times.Spells are obviously magical spells, but are divided into two distinct types. There's target spells which usually only effect one enemy, and\\xa0are therefore good assets in a one on one battle. These spells are rather pointless, though,\\xa0when you're up against a lot of enemies. That happens most of the time, actually. The other type\\xa0are called area spells, and, as you may guess, have smaller dammage but affect enemies in your immidiate surroundings.\\xa0Upgrading target spells increace their power, while upgrading area spells increase range. Skills are actually just archery and thieving. Archery is, as you would probably guess, all about bows and crossbows. Increasing your archery skill allows you to shoot faster, and dish out da pain more with each shot. Thieveing lets you... you know. Steal stuff. And be sneaky. Strength lets you deal out more damage with swords and axes, and increase your health. Overall, I think Fable's a awesome experience, but it's not without it's flaws.-Aaox\",\n",

       "  'description': \"\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 During an era where RPG's were played by taking turns and polygons ruled the world, a very well-renowned classic would see its epic story continue in three-dimensions.\\xa0 Chrono Cross is a game developed by a then Squaresoft, who had just brought the gaming world to its knees with the releases of Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII.\\xa0 Chrono Cross, is a quasi-sequel to the original Chrono Trigger that received tremendous success and response from the Nintendo community.\\xa0 Chrono Cross utilizes some of the well developed characters from the original Chrono Trigger although they assume different forms as the games are set in contrasting time-periods (i.e. Glenn and Frog).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The game follows Serge, a seventeen year old boy, who stumbles from his Home World into an alternate universe known as Another World.\\xa0 In this plane of existence, Serge has been dead for 10 years.\\xa0 He is determined to discover the finite details behind his death by embarking on a lengthy journey that spans the time-space continuum.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Throughout the course of this game you will have the opportunity to play as 45-characters, each with a unique set of techs (special abilities).\\xa0 Each character is lovable and fits in to the story (or sub-story) in a different way.\\xa0 A wide variety of characters are available: ranging from your typical heroic knight in Glenn, to your cute little blue alien friend, Starky and everything else in between.\\xa0 There's something for everyone, take Funguy for example, a talking mushroom man who, if the name is any indication of his character, is a real FUN-GUY (yeah I know, what a knee-slapper).\\xa0 Although you may find yourself gravitating to specific characters and not wanting to change your party members it's fun just to watch each individuals set of moves and smirk at the detail put into each character, from the way they attack to the way their text-based speech differs from the rest.\\xa0 (i.e Zoah, one of the four Acacian Dragoons who looks like he came out of the Rocky Horror Picture Show and TALKS LIKE THIS like he has VOICE MODULATION PROBLEMS).\\xa0 The first major thing that comes into mind while playing Chrono Cross is just the sheer scope and vastness of this universe.\\xa0 This game takes a long time to finish and if you love this game like I do, you can easily sink 80-hours into this story.\\xa0 Also the game features something called New Game + which is essentially the ability to start the game again with your original characters at the same levels you left them at.\\xa0 So much detail was placed into the story, characters and setting that you would feel guilty just breezing through this game without soaking in all of the intricacies laced into the disc.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Graphically this game is similar to the other Final Fantasy games of the Playstation but certainly plays well and is fluent enough to enjoy.\\xa0 The environments are lush and vivid.\\xa0 The lands of Home and Another World range from the prehistoric land of dinosaurs and giant mosquitoes to the sweaty and uncomfortable heat of a live volcano.\\xa0 Chrono Cross, like most other Square (Soft/Enix) produced games, uses pre-rendered CG cut scenes which are intensely colourful and smooth.\\xa0 The CG's will make your eyes pop and at the time leave you in awe with their beauty\\xa0 (If only the game played like this, you would ask yourself).\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 At the time of this games release I was quick to discount Chrono Cross as I thought it was just a lame attempt at a Final Fantasy game, but while playing it, there is a very sudden and abrupt moment early in the adventure that shows you just how unique the Chrono experience is.\\xa0 This game is vastly different than its Final Fantasy counterparts and if given the right opportunity is much better (which is a bold claim for me to make seeing as I am a huge Final Fantasy fan).\\xa0 This game is more grown up than Final Fantasy and is also more confusing, which is why most children at the time were too young to grip the concepts of FATE and trans-dimensional travel.\\xa0 Honestly, the game still gets me at times but is always something to question and hypothesize about.\\xa0 This story remains the only game in my expansive library that I wish gets the sequel it rightfully deserves.\\xa0 From the game-play to the story line this is by-far superior to any other Final Fantasy chapter and in my mind is the greatest game ever made.\\xa0 I am no Playstation fanboy, trust me I don't even own a Playstation 3, but this is the one game that would compel me to purchase one at a moments notice.\\xa0 Sony needs to commission Square-Enix to produce a sequel or a remade version of Chrono Cross that remains exclusive.\\xa0 A sequel or remade version would not only convert some of the lost RPG players of the 90's back to their platform but would also attract new players with this stellar piece of video game art. \",\n",

The story is more interesting than previous chapters, which all seemed self-contained and unrelated. Bright Side of the Moon ties everything together and gives it a suitable climax.

I won't go on and mention the similarities to Gears, Tomb Raider, God of War, Firefly or whatever. What really struck me the first time playing was how good everything looked and felt. Not just the graphics like water and jungle, but the presentation and feel. It was perfectly tuned for my tastes. The only complaint I personally can leverage against it was it was somewhat repetitive near the middle to near-end of the game as I do the same routine of walking into a room and taking out all the guys and repeating. The story was actually really interesting and the characters had such charm that it all took me by complete surprise. I bought the game pretty much on a whim with the PS3 and I'm so glad I did.

       "  'description': \"Maybe it's because it was already four years old somehow when I played it, but Max Payne 2 didn't impress me as much as the first game. The core gameplay is basically the same, and there's nothing wrong with it, it's just not as fresh. Bullet Time works a little differently, as Max moves at almost the same speed as he does normally while everyone else is stuck in slow motion, and it's an interesting dynamic. It almost changes Bullet Time to more of a Win Button than a helpful assist, but I didn't overuse it because I find shoot-dodging to be more entertaining. The nightmare levels are back, and they're less annoying while still being interesting breaks in the action. It's also a short game. The first wasn't long either, but I beat this is just a few sessions, none of which were particularly lengthy. It doesn't feel like anything was missing or too rushed, it just seemed like maybe it was a little lacking in value.The graphics are significantly improved for the sequel. Max's face looked silly in the first game, with a digitized face lazily slapped onto a character model. Max Payne 2 actually has facial models, and everything looks much more natural. The comic book style cut-scenes are back, and they're still pretty cool. The dialog is the same stilted, over-dramatic noir stuff, but it's entertaining anyway. The story is all right, but it has a problem with tone. The actual plot is fairly dark in depressing, but there's an awful lot of jokey lines between guards and a stupidly over-the-top whacky mob boss that doesn't really fit. It's a pretty good game, but it holds itself back from greatness.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'I came in with low expectations for Lego Indiana Jones. Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised, as this game is fun that anybody, no matter what age, can enjoy.The clean, cute look of the Lego Star Wars games is here, albeit with less sci-fi and more adventure. The environments are all either recreated or influenced by a scene in the original trilogy of Indiana Jones movies. Either way, they are a lot of fun to navigate around in and players can discern specific movie references here and there. Graphicswise, the game looks excellent on the Xbox 360. It may not be a demo disc for your HD television, but the environments are very well animated and the jungle scenes in particular are pleasant to the eyes. The audio is fine, too. The sound effects aren\\'t going to blow any seasoned gamer away, but they get the job done. However, the music composed by John Williams is, obviously, great and never tires the ears. The only technical problem I can note is some screen-tearing, especially in Barnett College.Speaking of the college, that is where the player will mingle between missions and run around in if he/she wants to. The college is a deeper hub system than Lego Star Wars\\' Cantina or diner. There are secret areas that can be unlocked, and your treasures from missions are put up for proud display. The unlockable characters also walk the halls of the college, and there are many to see and use.However, unlockables and graphics are nice, but how is the actual gameplay? Well, it depends. I enjoyed the Lego Star Wars games for their simple approach to combat, platforming and puzzle solving. Some people didn\\'t. Lego Indiana Jones doesn\\'t change much, but what is there is probably the most refined out of all the Lego games to date. Picking up objects is a new addition, and a fun one at that, as using shovels and wrenches to both dig and fix objects and bash enemies across the head is very entertaining. Indy\\'s whip is not what most players will expect it to be, but it is still a pleasure to use. Instead of combat purposes (which it can do), the whip is primarily used for swinging across chasms and pulling levers, all which are beautifully animated. Most of the other characters are good (Jones Sr., Short Round, Bazooka trooper), but, like Lego Star Wars, there are too many characters in different costumes. I don\\'t want more than five Indiana Jones or an enemy guard for mountains, desert and every place I have gone to, but this move just feels like pushing the number of characters to the largest possible digit. Some puzzles are a little difficult to find out first, but i never had to go to an online forum or FAQ to find out the answers. It honestly is not that hard.Still, unlocking characters and uncovering all of the artifacts has a thrill to it that is remarkable for such a \"kids\" game. No matter what age the player is, they will have a lot of fun seeing the wonderful, hilarious cutscenes portray the movies, and playing as Indy with his trademark Fedora. There are a bunch of easy achievements to get, and reaching the 1000 mark is very possible for the unexperienced Achievement whore. For the few faults it may have, Lego Indiana Jones is a worthwhile investment for any gamer looking for some easy Achievements, great humor, but, most importantly, a lot of fun.',\n",

The campaign is ridiculously streamlined from start to finish, with an unprecedented level of polish rarely seen. Graphically it is superb, but not amazing. By no means amazing. Havok physics are incredible, and the bloom/HDR effects look great, but the textures and models don't compete with games like Gears and COD4.4 player co-op is amazing, and tons of fun.

       "  'description': 'Sonic and the Secret Rings was, to many, Sonic\\'s last chance to redeem himself after the debacles that were \"Shadow the Hedgehog\" and \"Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)\". This game certainly succeeds in that respect, and is easily the best 3D Sonic game since the days of the Dreamcast.We\\'ll start with what feels immediately different from previous entries in the series. First of all, you no longer completely control your forward and backwards movement. You move forward automatically, and can adjust your speed through jumping, stopping, and manipulating your environment. This virtually eliminates camera and perspective problems that have so plagued recent 3D Sonic games. Overall, the controls are responsive and well-done, even though there are a few hiccups.Another addition is the experience system, which essentially allows you to purchase new skills after completing certain tasks. Some of the power-ups feel like they should have been available from the start, but the game feels perfect when you\\'ve got Sonic tweaked just so. I don\\'t think Sonic has ever controlled as beautifully as he did for me towards the end of the game.The music is very inconsistent in this one. Some of the songs are very catchy, while others will have you scrambling for the mute button. Sound effects from the Wii remote are functional, if unimpressive. Sonic\\'s American voice is terrible, but thankfully you have the option to switch to the Japanese and utilize subtitles.At the time of its release, this game was probably the most beautiful to grace the Wii. Everything looks crisp and clear in 480p and 16:9, and it was probably the first game looked like an improvement over the previous console generation. The art styIe is great, with an authentic \"Arabian Nights\" feel.The story is another area where this game falters, which is puzzling since it is nothing more than a retelling of the cIassic \"Arabian Nights\". Once again, however, we are provided with a way around this flaw by having the ability to completely skip story sequences.The game play is varied and consistently good, even if the difficulty is erratic. There are many different types of levels, which serve to break up the monotony of previous games. Just when you start to tire of something, you are presented with an entirely new option. Not being forced to progress through the game in a purely linear fashion is also a major plus. The bosses are very well-done and stand above previous Sonic bosses.One of the worst parts of the previous games was having Sonic\\'s friends shoved down your throat. Fear not, because Sonic\\'s friends are reduced to cheerleaders and multiplayer mini-games. Speaking of multiplayer mini-games, those are decent. They feel very tacked-on, but they can be fun with a small group. Certainly not a showcased feature of the game.Overall, you\\'re looking at a great package with some flaws that keep it from being a truly superb title. If you ever had an interest in the Sonic series, give this one a shot. If you had lost faith because of recent Sonic games, take heart. This one could re-inspire your love for our spiky blue hero.',\n",

It helps if you have followed the MGS storyline up to now but newcomers will fit in here to.The gameplay of MGS PO is amazing considering its on the PSP. You can bult up your own army from getting rival soliders to join your side you can then use them in various Units such as Medical, technical and more. The main units are the sneaking ones who are the ones who actually carry out the mission. You can have spy units whihc you place on various places they then collect info for your squard such as a weapon may be discovered at that location then you can go and get it. Technical unit lets you devlop gadgets such as thermal googles NVG, mine detecors and a load of other stuff and the medical staff help you to heal faster. Your army can be as big as 100 soliders! As well as that you must work together with Roy Campball (should seem familar) whom you meet at the beginning of the game. you can do all the stuff you could on other MGS games like wall hug, jump out shots, crawl, aim and shoot in first person mode, hold up and much more. The famous CQC returns from MGS3 however is a bit tricky to master considering the controls.The gaphics are great for a portable game from the characters to the buildings and environment.

Although the sound is great from footsteps to gun sounds and the good voice acting in the cut scenes, there are places its just doesnt exsist. firstly in the famous CODEC scenes n all other MGS games you can hear the voices now theres dead silence and you have to read everything, thihs is the same for the briefing screen with Roy 'talking' but you actually having to read the text again. Other little bits include when you have someone and are intergating them snake just always says 'talk' and then the hostage scream, but at the bottom of the screen its actually tells you what they meant to says such as 'don't kill me..' instead of them actually saying it. If the sound was more worked on this game would have been excellent.The PSP game comes with online play! A feature which most PSP games don't have i was looking forward to playing MGS online.... it didn't dissapoint with a varity of modes and the works including personal scores and ranking online is very fun and can kill a lot of time, unfortunatly nowa days the servers don't seem very crowed.....Overall this game is great for well anybody, its way better then the other crappy MGS acid games for the psp. If you can afford it get it! The story is very deep and last a while and with reply value for side missions and excellent gameplay it just says 'pick me up before you go go'.\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'Come Along and Kick Ass with Kratos!',\n",
       "  'description': '\"Holy ****, this game kicks ***!\" will likely be the first thing that comes out of your mouth when you pop God of War in your Playstation 2. The first game in the premiere franchise, GoW casts you in the role of Kratos, a Spartan warrior on a mission of vengeance against the war god Ares. Kratos is your stereotypical sort of anti-hero. He\\'s big, scowly, unforgiving, and is only out to kill Ares for his own selfish reasons. It just happens that the gods want Ares dead, too, so Kratos agrees to help them. While you may not really need much backstory to get you motivated to kill everything in Greece, as you discover the gruesome history between Kratos and Ares you\\'ll find yourself wanting to kill Ares more and more.Third person action games live and die by their battle mechanics. GoW\\'s combat is not only spectacular, but it also introduces some new gameplay elements that set it apart from other similar games. You begin GoW with the devastating chainblades. They\\'re a bit of a cross between a sword and a whip, and Kratos makes full use of their abilities. For instance, you\\'ll be able to fling your enemies into the air and throw them back to the ground. You\\'ll unleash a whirlwind attack that cuts through the baddies like butter. You’ll drop the enemy to their backs and stab out their hearts. As if that\\'s not enough, Kratos is granted additional weapons by the gods, including a heavy sword that\\'s just perfect for decapitation, a Medusa head that petrifies your enemies, and Zeus\\' lightning bolts. Each weapon has its uses, but the chainblades get the job done most of the time and are, by far, the most fun weapons to use.In a nice touch of twitch gameplay, an icon representing the PS2\\'s buttons and analog controls will appear over an enemy\\'s head once you wear them down. Pressing the corresponding button sequence executes a finishing move that will give Kratos more experience, magic power, or life. Each finishing move is unique to the enemy type, and they all are totally gross. It\\'s the kind of gross that\\'s just awesome, like ripping the head off of medusa, stabbing the crap out of a cyclops\\' eye, or tearing the wings off of a harpy. As you can tell by now, overkill is definitely the theme of combat in GoW. GoW is unrelentingly nasty, and just gets more and more over-the-top as the game wears on. At no point will you feel the slightest bit of remorse for what you\\'ve done to your enemies. You\\'ll find that they all deserve to die the most painful death they can by Kratos\\' cold and uncaring hands.Obviously, the presentation in this game needs to be good to keep up with the brutality. As heads go flying, soldiers burn to a crisp, and hydras get swords jabbed into their faces, you\\'ll be amazed at the high level of graphical polish and vicious-sounding audio. Nowhere is this more evidenced than the few, but incredible, boss fights. The bosses take up the entire screen, and are complete with dripping fangs, dark gleaming eyes, and thunderous roars of pain as you sink your chainblades into them. Kratos looks especially badass and is animated very well, especially when he\\'s putting a major hurting on his enemies. As you execute combos, the really powerful finishing attacks slow the entire game down for a split second, sort of like bullet time from the Matrix, so you can see that Kratos is about to put his enemies to rest, permanently. Kratos has a deep, dark voice and he sounds almost haunted by his pain. The voiceover work is excellent from every character, though you won\\'t recognize any familiar voices.Make no mistake, GoW is unapologetically mature. There\\'s cursing, sex, blood, decapitation, disembowelment, and human sacrifice. Amazingly, each element fits well; it\\'s not just about gratuitous violence. The entire story is about one man\\'s desire to kill the god that ruined him. The brutality of the game serves to show you how far one man can fall. Could GoW been toned down and gotten its point across? Sure, but the maturity of the game serves the theme without overshadowing it and brings more punch to the story.Having amazing fighting, great graphics and sound, and tons of blood doesn\\'t mean that GoW is perfect, however. First, the combat is exciting, but the bad guys are very repetitive. You’ll face off against maybe 10 or so enemies repeatedly throughout the game.\\xa0 Once you figure out how to take them down quickly, they become nothing more than cannon fodder to your blades. When you do wipe the floor with the baddies, you’ll find that you may do quite a bit of backtracking through the current area in order to solve the puzzles. The enemies don’t respawn, so you don’t waste a lot of time slogging through the same area, but it is a bit boring to go through the same room over and over again. Lastly, although the game is great from beginning to end, it does end rather quickly, and there’s no real replayability.\\xa0 Once you kill everything, you’ll wrap up the story and move onto another game.God of War is a fantastic game and is certainly on a short list of “must-have” PS2 games. There are few games that risk this kind of mature content, and fewer still that justify it like GoW. This short game is worth your time. Just make sure that you put the kids to bed before firing it up.',\n",

       " {'deck': 'The Longest Journey',\n",
       "  'description': \"I'm annoyed whenever I spend more on stuff than it turns out I have to.  It happens sometimes with games.  I bought Shadow of the Colossus at full price, and before I got around to playing it, it was re-released as a Greatest Hits title, so I essentially paid $20 for non-hideous packaging. Does anyone think that red color looks good? What happened with the Longest Journey games wasn't as bad but it was still annoying. Dreamfall: The Longest Journey was put on Steam for $30 and I jumped on a 10% discount because I was interested in it. A couple months later, my hopes to play the prequel were made easier by its own release on Steam, but it was in a deal with Dreamfall for $25 total, so I ended up paying much more than I had to if I just waited a bit. Oh well, it happens some times.Being a point-and-click adventure game, The Longest Journey focuses on storytelling over gameplay. There's a lot of running around, discussions, and puzzle solving. As I gave an example of in an earlier post, a lot of puzzles involve bizarre leaps of logic and item hunting, but it's all fun when you figure it out. Usually the game is good about letting you know what to do next, but sometimes it either doesn't make it clear enough or just doesn't tell you, which can lead to confusion. You know what your next goal is, but before it gets triggered you have to go somewhere or do something else, and it can lead to wasted time going back and forth.The graphics are strange in their duality. The backgrounds and environments are a mixture of photographs, hand drawings, and pre-rendered computer images, and look generally very nice. The real-time character models however, are terrible. They're extremely low resolution, are usually poorly animated, and don't interact with each other or the environment well. This is forgivable for three reasons, though. The game was originally released seven years ago, when most games looked bad; it's not an action game that requires accurate interactions to work; and the art direction and visual design are strong enough that you can appreciate it anyway.The story and writing are really very good. What's quickly noticeable is how funny the game is. Dreamfall had a few wise-cracking characters (mostly who were introduced here), but it was a mostly serious game that focused on its dramatic story. April Ryan is a much more quirky and light-hearted heroine than Zoe or her future, hardened self from Dreamfall. Her grounded sense of humor permeates the whole game, and the epic story doesn't seem worse for it. Speaking of the storyline, it's quite interesting, telling the tale of a world with two opposite halves, one a vision of earth in the future, the other a land of fantasy. A new group has come to disrupt the delicate balance, and April has to explore both worlds to find what she needs to stop them. The pacing is generally very good - like Dreamfall did, it starts a bit slow but can grab you and pull you forward until it ends before you know it. I only had one problem. Near the end, the pace has been accelerating for a while and you can feel it coming to a climax soon, but you end up having to dawdle around on a space station for a while before you get to the last area. Despite that and a few other hiccups, The Longest Journey is one of the better experiences you'll have with an engrossing story in a game. I'm looking forward to the episodic conclusion to the whole saga that was announced in May.\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'Sonic Rush',\n",
       "  'description': 'Sonic Rush is everything that made the Genesis classics great and more. You\\'ve got your sense of speed, great boss fights, and you don\\'t have any superfluous characters being shoved down your throat.The game looks and sounds great. This is Sonic in a 2.5D adventure; a first for the series. The character models are in 3D, and the levels and backgrounds are all in brilliantly colored 2D. You couldn\\'t ask anything more from a DS title. The music is catchy and always seems to suit the situation. As the gameplay speeds up, the music does too. If your time limit is running down, the music gets a panicky feel to it, and it really gets your heart going.The gameplay is a fresh take on a classic formula. You\\'ve got your standard \"press right to win\" going on, but things are complicated (in a good way) by the two screens of the DS. You\\'ll be running and end up going from one screen straight over to the other depending on your direction and momentum. You\\'ve also got a speed burst, activated by pressing a button. Your speed burst is good for two things: killing enemies and making quick escapes. You build up your burst meter by doing tricks in the air, which amounts to nothing more than pressing a few buttons as you fall. If you happen to fill your meter completely before using your speed burst, you gain invincibility for a short time. What this game does really well, as the name would imply, is maintain its sense of speed. Sonic is about going fast, and you\\'ll do just that in this title.The boss fights are very well-done. You all know the drill: Robotnik jumps into a giant robot and tries to squash you. You\\'ll be chasing sea dragons, jumping over steam-rollers, jumping on heads, and spin dashing all over the place. Hard to find any issues there.We also get to meet Blaze the Cat in this game. The story of this title revolves around her. The story is incredibly simple, but I think that\\'s what a Sonic fan wants. You aren\\'t going to find yourself skipping through endless menus trying to get to the action. Here\\'s the gist of it: There are two dimensions. Sonic is from one, Blaze is from the other. Each has its own version of Robotnik, and they\\'ve met up because the universes somehow came together. Playing as either Sonic or Blaze, you progress through the levels in an effort to stop them. Everything controls as it should, and you don\\'t suffer from \"cheap deaths\" like you might in some other Sonic games from running too fast and finding an unexpected cliff.The multiplayer is what you might expect: you race your friend to the end of the level. You only need one cart to play with a friend, and you can also send a demo of the game to them. It\\'s a fun distraction, but ultimately not the focus of the game.There are a few faults with the game, but nothing major. Sonic veterans may find it a little easy at first, but some of the later zones and boss fights can be quite the challenge. The story is cheesy and shallow, but that could be a good or bad thing for a Sonic fan, depending on who you ask. Without a doubt, the largest issue with this game is the length. It is in-arguably too short, but the replay value is high with fun multiplayer, two difficulty levels, and two characters.Overall, this is one of the better handheld Sonic packages out there. It is essentially an extension of the excellent Sonic Advance series, and it manages to improve upon the previous games in every way. It\\'s an incredible deal for the price, and you owe it to yourself if you like Sonic or 2D platforming games in general.',\n",

       "  'description': \"The answer to all them questions is yes!Burnout paradise is the first burnout game for next gen consoles. It goes in a different direction to the series because unlike the other arcade racing burnouts this has gone for the free roaming part. You are in paradise city which has tons to do in it, you start of as a rubbish driver which a learners permit and must win events to get better driving liences. Paradise city itself is huge with 250 miles of road to drive on (don't know why some people complain about its size?!) and at each junction with traffic lights you can start an event by doing a burnout in total there are 120 events to try and complete, event types include race. Now at first i found the races REALLY hard to do compared to other burnout games coz there is only a brief street sign flash when you must turn a corner and i always missed it but you do get used to it. There is the return of road rage where you must takedown other drivers. burnout routes are where you go from point a to b in a certain amount of time and win an upgrade for the car you do it in (ecah burning route requires a different car). Marked man which is where you must get from point a to b without getting wrecked, and finally stunt run where you do awsome stunts to score points!.Dont think it stops at events though ooooo no no no they is a whole bunch of stuff to do in paradise city. Every road in paradise city has to be 'ruled' which means betting its time and crashing on it which is done by steering your wreck into cars to get more boost which allows you to carry on rolling (this is an attempy to replace the much loved crash mode but ts still good) Then there are 50 jumps to jump, 120 billbords to smash and 400 smashes to smash, each rewarding a car for your hard efforts, they are drivethroughs to find, rewards to earn and more! you gotta work hard to get 100%!Graphically the game is amazing and shows why we all love next gen consoles. You can see shadopws of trees and mountains in the background and all the cars look and sound great which brings me too...Sound! The games sound is amazing which each car making their engine roar! ..... right now we get the vice acting, The DJ in the game is VERY GOOD! No one likes him (not even gamespot) but i do his voice acting is great and he always talks to you giving you hints and tips or other ramdom cool info. Now the music which EA has put in is again great (even though i seem to be the only one who thinks so...) There are quality tracks from burnout 1,2 and 3 how cool is that (ahh burnout 1 memory lane) and other tracks which are great.Gamplay does kinda get boring sometimes when you are far into the game (same type of events to do to get that elite licence), but is still great,As getting confused at the beginning of the game, this is true... but you soon get the hang of it.Online play... WOW. It is great no more lobbies just instanly freeburn with people and friends with no load times!!! You can compete to try and get the best drifts, oncoming, near misses ect, race and the best bit team up to complete 350 online challenges!This game is by far THE BEST RACING GAME EVER and is well worth racing fans money, heck even if you dont like racing games you will like this one! Only bad thing is it will get boring and hard when you have spent a LONG time on it. Dont let that put you of though, EXCELLENT GAME!!\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'God of War II',\n",
       "  'description': \"The first God of War was exciting and ambitious, but flawed. Its sequel doesn't fix all of its problems, but it is still an improvement on the formula and in most ways the better game. A lot of people will always like the original more because it was new, it was fresh, and all that. But I appreciate it when a sequel builds on the predecessor, refining what makes it great and dropping what didn't work, while making sure to keep it interesting and maybe taking it to the next level. They certainly do that with the scale and brutality in this game. At times it seems almost too epic, like when you leap from the back of a Pegasus onto a Griffin while flying thousands of feet in the air, slice off its wings and spike it to the earth below. The massive temple environments are extremely impressive, and the scale of your journey is just so much larger. A quest of vengeance against Ares seems pedestrian next to the goal of changing the course of time to defeat Zeus himself. The end sets up a third game to end the story arc brilliantly, and the sequel on PS3 has the potential to be amazing.They added a lot more boss fights this time around, although a lot of them aren't as impressive as the ones in the first game. Fighting gigantic statues and sea creatures is awesome, but a lot are against people more your size and less interesting mechanically. None of them are bad though, and it's interesting how the game depicts you as killing off various famous Greek heroes and icons like the Colossus of Rhodes brought to life. Oh, so an angry dude took it down, not an earthquake. The combat was refined a little, and it was nice to see the inclusion of some new weapons, although none of them handled as well or as enjoyably as the classic chain blades. They added some new context sensitive maneuvers and platforming elements which mostly integrated well into the gameplay. I still think the inclusion of puzzle and adventure elements is what really makes God of War more enjoyable than the average button-mashing action game, and it's still a lot of fun. Unfortunately, they haven't run out of truly annoying ideas that make you want to grab the designer by the throat and ask him what the hell he was thinking. Combat is fun, but not when you have to do it to give yourself time to rotate a lever or something, and failing to do so quickly enough results in your death. It's not more exciting, it's just irritating, frustrating garbage. At least that stuff is limited to a much smaller role than in the first game. What they were able to still do with the PS2 hardware is incredible, and it's a terrific finale for the console.\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'A Fantastic Deviation',\n",
       "  'description': \" Nintendo is a company of franchises. Quality franchises no doubt, but Nintendo thrives on it's few killer properties. Zelda. Mario. Metroid. These games are all longstanding series, and whenever a new iteration is released, it includes some minor gameplay tweaks, graphical updates, and a new story; but the core experience generally changes very little. While these experiences are always solid, sometimes the same ol' same ol' gets stale. Enter The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. Nintendo threw tradition out the door with Majoras Mask, and the results are phenomenal.  The previous Zelda game on the Nintendo 64 was Ocarina of Time, the first 3-D Zelda game. That's a hard act to follow, and Nintendo, smartly, didn't make Majora's Mask a direct competitor with Ocarina of Time. Majora's mask keeps the controls from Ocarina, but completely revamps the gameplay. Majoras Mask takes place in the land of Termina; most specifically, Clock Town and the surrounding lands. Entering Termina on a personal journey in search of a beloved friend, Link's journey is quickly interrupted when he encounters the devious, masked Skull Kid. Skull Kid attacks Link, and takes his takes precious Ocarina of Time. Link gives chase, intent on retrieving his treasure, but upon confronting Skull Kid, Link finds himself outmatched, and ends up cursed, encased in a body of a Deku Scrub. After befriending a new fairy, Link sets out into Clock town, where he quickly learns the source of all this trouble. A mask. More specifically, the titular Majora's Mask, whose powers Skull Kid is using to bring destruction to Clock Town. Skull Kid's plans will be completed in three days, giving Link little time to stop him. The length of a day in Majora's Mask has been increased to close to twenty minutes, from the measly 2 or three it took to complete a full day/night cycle in Ocarina. But one hour won't cut it to defeat Skull Kid, and after reclaiming his Ocarina, Link can travel back to the dawn of the first day, or slow the flow of time, so time isn't generally much of a factor. When traveling back in time, the citizens of Skull town forget Link, and he loses minor items, but keeps major ones, such as heart pieces or masks.  Masks are a major factor in Majora's Mask. There are many masks for you to collect, scattered through the game, with functions as varied as allowing you to create a marching band full of animals, to helping you inquire as to the location of a missing boy. There are three main masks that Majora's Mask utilizes prominently. These masks allow you to change form from your normal human shape, to that of another race, such as the Deku Scrub. These new forms have new abilities and weaknesses, and help spruce up the gameplay. Playing in these forms isn't a chore as you might expect, but instead very entertaining and rewarding. Zipping around the Goron racetrack while curled up into a ball is a exhilarating experience, and there are certainly more like it within Majora's Mask.  Majora's Mask features less than half the dungeons found in Ocarina of Time, yet you'll probably still squeeze about the same amount of play time from both. How is this? As has already been mentioned, the central hub of Majora's Mask is Clock Town. Since it is a TOWN, there are many denizens whom you may interact with. And here, we come to what is undoubtedly, the single thing most important aspect of Majora's Mask.  The NPCs all feel real. They have their own schedules, they have their own interactions and motivations. They move about the town doing what they need to do. They comment on the weather. Shops close at night, and shady characters emerge. Majora's Mask achieves what no game has ever done: it breathes life into EVERY. SINGLE. CHARACTER. It's truly something that you must see for yourself to comprehend, but it's an amazing feat, and one which makes the game just amazing to play.  So of course, you'll want to interact with these amazing characters right? And here we encounter the other important thing about the game. Majora's Mask is mostly built around side-quests. You'll unearth these quests by talking to the right person at the right time, or listening to a noteworthy exchange between two NPCs. This is going to be a love it or hate it sort of thing, but Majora is packed full of side-quests for the adventurous soul. Of course, you CAN play the game just for it's dungeons, but your enjoyment and value is going to be severely reduced, since the game only features four dungeons and a smattering of required non-dungeon play.  Majora runs on the same engine that powered Ocarina, and it holds up well. Incremental improvements have been made to keep the game from feeling dated, and they do a good job of it. Majora sports higher-res textures, larger environments, slightly enhanced music, and a large world. And thats not even taking into account that the game must keep track of the whereabouts of 30+ NPCs while you're off gallivanting through the mountains. Sadly, you'll see many of the character models from Ocarina repeated here, one of the few corners Nintendo cut on this ambitious sequel.  As amazing as Zelda is, occasionally the game gets a bit too ambitious. You'll notice some frame-rate drops when the screen gets a bit too crowded, and the sound doesn't match up to the epic score contained in Ocarina of Time. Only occasionally will you run into camera problems, but it will pop up as a problem once or twice. Zelda is a spectacular game, but sometimes a wee bit too ambitious for it's own good.  So, in closing, Zelda: Majora's Mask is an ambitious game, and a game that manages to deliver on nearly all fronts. Amazing characters, great new mechanics, updated presentation, Zelda does not disappoint. While some of the close-minded may not appreciate this game, for those who can accept something new, this is a masterpiece, and undoubtedly one of the greatest games of all time. It's a new level of immersion, and a worthy brother to Ocarina of Time. Play it now. Remember it forever. \",\n",

       " {'deck': \"Rusty's StarCraft Review\",\n",
       "  'description': \"There are many games out there who have been awarded the, “Greatest Game of All Time,” title, but I don't think any other game deserves it as much as StarCraft. It practically birthed competitive gaming, and took it to the extremes; countries like South Korea have TV channels dedicated to people playing StarCraft. With the release of StarCraft 2 in a few months (hopefully) time, I decided to let you guys know my opinion on this wonderful game. The story is spread out over 3 campaigns, each of which follow the 3 factions in the game. Each campaign has 10 missions, which range from about 20 minutes to one hour plus play times each. The first campaign follows the Terrans, which are humans. The Terrans are the most convoluted of factions in this game; even with fighting off the Zerg and Protoss, they are fighting civil wars amongst themselves. You have control of Jim Raynor, a Marshall under the Confederacy, who doesn't like the way the Confederates do stuff, so he joins up with the rebel group known as the Sons of Korhal, who want to bring down the Confederates. They eventually do, but Raynor isn't that happy with how things went down, so he leaves the Sons of Korhal and starts his own group, Raynor's Raiders.   Now the second campaign starts, which lets you control the Zerg. In the first few missions you have to protect a chrysalis which contains one of the series key characters. During those missions, you start getting the idea that the Zerg want to be the best race around, so they start attacking others, particularly the Protoss; the Zerg want to take over the Protoss' main planet, Aiur. After that you get to control the Protoss in the last campaign. I won't say much about this since it wraps up the story pretty damn well. The game controls like any other RTS game. You start out with a fairly small base, and a few builder units to help build it up. Most of the time you will be telling your worker units to harvest you some Minerals and Vespene Gas, those being the resources you use in the game. You use the resources to build buildings and train units at the various buildings you may use. Of course, with your growing army, you will need something to support them. Terrans use Supply Depots, Zerg use Overlords, and Protoss use Pylons. The Terran Supply Depot just sits there; the Zerg Overlord is an air unit that you can use to transport other units, and the Protoss Pylon have to be placed strategically over your base, because the Protoss buildings have to be in the vicinity of your Pylon, as the Pylon powers your settlement. Each race also has drastically different worker units; the Terran sport SCVs, which are guys in suits that build stuff, they build buildings; the Zerg use drones, which have to mutate into different buildings, which means sacrificing your drone for a building; and the Protoss use drones, which can warp in buildings and go harvest some resources while the building is warping in.  With 3 factions, each one has different strategies. The Terrans usually use lots of Siege Tanks, accompanied by a few Battlecruisers to take care of any air units they may find in their way of ownage. The Zerg will defeat enemies by sheer number of units, usually in the opening rush of the match. If that match fails however, Mutalisks and Guardians with some Ultralisks on the ground usually do the job done in the following stages of the match. The Protoss are probably the most strategic of the 3 factions. They will most likely use a group of Dragoons to find the enemy base, then move in Carriers with Reavers in them, which deal massive damage if micro-d properly. Mission structure consists of usually, destroying everything on the map. Destroying everything is also the main premise of the multiplayer mode. Once or twice in a campaign you will have a linear mission in which you control a small group of units and take them through the map, eventually finding more units to join them. StarCraft looked good, when it came out that is. It uses sprites, and is on a fixed, isometric view. Each of the factions are easily distinguishable amongst each other; the Terran's are gray and robotic, the Zerg are browish and slimy, and the Protoss have their signature yellow armor, and definitely look like guys you shouldn't be messing with. The backgrounds look nice, although organized; the game uses a grid system where your buildings take up a certain amount of squares on the grid. The same system is also applied in the Campaign Editor which comes with the game, which lets users create their own maps. StarCraft also had really good looking CG cutscenes, which raised the bar for cutscenes in game. Audio in this game is outstanding. Every single unit has different sayings and different voice talents. Eventually if you keep clicking on one unit long enough, he'll say something weird, like the Siege Tank singing Ode to Joy. The soundtrack is also really well done. Each faction has its own unique musical score; the Terrans have a rock-like music, the Zerg have dark-techno, and the Protoss have just ambient music. After many years in development, and first being regarded as, “Warcraft in space,” StarCraft made a really deep impact on PC gaming and gaming in general. With the impending release of StarCraft 2, players will still be playing StarCraft before and after the sequels release. It is really a gem that shouldn't be missed by anyone, and since it has been 10 years since the games original release, it will run on mostly every computer.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Nintendo's internal developers (namely Nintendo Tokyo, Sora, and Retro Studios) have created some impressive works of visual art, but third party developers are still struggling to take advantage of the (comparitively weak) graphics hardware under the Wii's hood. Enter Grasshopper Manufacture and their not-quite-ready-for-primetime lead designer Gouichi Suda who, in No More Heroes, has created a game which accentuates the shortcomings of the Wii to create an altogether bizarre place called Santa Destroy. It features an art style that mixes the cel-shading of Killer7 with the downright ugliness of the original Playstation, and throws in some surprisingly cool lighting and shading for a very schizophrenic effect.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0And schizophrenic is probably the best word to describe the game's mechanics, layout, and plot as well.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0No More Heroes opens with our protagonist standing on a motel balcony, and it might take you a second to realize you have control of his movement. Don't fret, however, as soon as you approach the steps, a cinematic is triggered that introduces the plot and the (totally fucked up) tone of the game. At which point you are given the option of playing a tutorial, which introduces the basic mechanics of the game. I have found that the amount of tutorial scenarios one has the patience to sit through is equal to the amount of enjoyment one has with the game. At first it would seem there is only one thing to do, combat-wise: which is run up to dudes, lock on to them with Z, and slice them with your “beam katana” with A. In other words, the first blush is that of a button-masher, not even a waggler which is supposed to be the Wii's equivalent! However, the tutorials also obviate some advanced techniques which involve both use of the other buttons on the controller and different motions. Suffice it to say that by the middle of the game, Travis will have a considerable suite of moves that combine both swashbuckling and grappling for some intensely savage (and satisfying) kills. Once past this tutorial, and through the introductory level, you'll be back at your motel with not much to do.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Despite an opening level that feels very linear, the game plays out in an open-world setting that at first seems sparsely populated. Santa Destroy is full of seemingly abandoned buildings, civillians you cannot kill, vehicles you cannot hijack or demolish, a coconut stand, a video store, and that's it – at first. As you complete main story missions, you'll unlock more “sidejobs” (which are basically minigames), which, once completed will pave the way for new assassination side missions. These assassination missions give you different conditions for killing different groups of dudes in different familiar (read: previously-completed) settings and test your skills and earn you the money that will allow you to unlock the next level. The more levels you complete, the more buildings will open up. Eventually a clothing store, a weapon upgrade facility, a training centre, and a man who wants you to run about the city collecting his namesake balls (don't laugh) will open their doors to you.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Of course you don't have to run around, despite the absence of hijackable vehicles, there is a way to get around relatively quickly. The Speltiger (best pronounced “SHPEL-tee-guh”) is awkward to handle at first, but is capable of some pretty interesting manouvres once you get to do some experimenting. There is no penalty for doing so as the Speltiger is indestructible, as there is no significant police presence in the city of Santa Destroy.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0This is not the Wii-equivalent of Grand Theft Auto. The game's emphasis is on melee combat and the open-world element is just to tie the disparate elements together (plus, ordering badass teeshirts online is too newschool for this game). And with respect to melee combat, the further you advance, the more fun it becomes. You can equip Travis with some awesome throws and grabs (which are performed by moving both your hands in different directions based on on-screen prompts) that will transform your enemies into a fountain of blood and coins just as efficiently as mashing the A button does in the beginning, but the AI improves with each level, and you will soon be forced into defend-and-counter positions by the amount of enemies thrown at you; button mashing quickly becomes useless.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Each level is basically the same formula: superficial dungeon-crawling elements (seeking collectible Wrestling cards) and a crapload of identical dudes, and then a totally crazy boss. Thankfully the skins of the identical dudes differ from level to level (everything from Crazy-88 style suits to baseball uniforms, and some pretty hilarious stuff in between). While the bosses precipitate story-unfolding cinematics which contain the kind of cheesy dialogue you've come to expect from Suda 51 and some excellent variety and challenge from level to level.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0The plot and characterization feature some instant-classic (and vulgar) one-liners and some truly gory eviscerations, all in all, the kinds of things people thought they would never see on the Wii. Suda51 weaves a story that will make you wish there were more developers with the audacity he has, while poking fun at the ludicrous superficiality of many popular contributions to this medium.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0In addition to the so-bad-it's-good voice-acting, and the awesome lo-fi sound effects, there are some really great, allbeit rudamentary, tunes in the game that cover Latin pop, (cheesy-as-all-hell) technopop, and some super-funky Atariesque music. In sum, thanks to its surprising mechanical depth, charmingly ugly art style, excellent (if low-key) music, memorable boss fights, and jaw-droppingly crazy story, No More Heroes stands up as this reviewer's favourite Wii game thusfar.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Resistance was one of the lauch titles for the PS3 in 2006, and a great title it is.Resistance is all about 'aliens' called chimera. they were humans but have been infected and have been muted into chimera using conversion centres. In just two months the chimera took over all of Europe and have arrived at England. Which is where the game kicks of...You play as Hale a solider who is trying to defeat the chimera with the rest of humanity. Right at the beginning of the game he gets infected but nothing happens... So this makes you want to play the game through to see how that works out....Resistance has good graphics for a first person shooter but considering its on a PS3 i cant shake the feeling that they could have been better (even some PS2 shooters look better). However graphics are still great from the AI teamates and all the different types of chimera and the environment and explosions look cool too.Sound is great with each gun making a different sound and the growls of the chimera and shouting and footsteps ect. What doesnt impress me however is the storyline and voice acting as Hale never says anything and there is proper cool lenghly cut scenes just a crappy (most of the time) black and white image or map with that woman talking.Gamplay is the best part of reistance, wherever you are in the game you will always be in an intence shootout with very good AI (which use cover and flank you). Resistance also has brillant online play which when played you can unlock loads of goodies (which i love) including ribbons, medals and even go up ranks and customise what your online character looks like.Replay value is here as hidden weapons can be found when you play the game through again and you can play through it again anyway to get even more goodies (skill points).There is a co op mode which is fun but isnt online which is kinds disappointing.resistance at times can be quite a scary game (i know i jumped when i was in a tight corrider and chimera jump out right in front of you and respawn behind you!!!)Overall reistance is a good quality game but it would have scored higher only if the story was more developed, if it had online co op and lastly i just cant shake the feeling more could be improved in this game...\",\n",

       "  'description': 'This is the fifth GTA game I\\'ve played on the PS2 using the same engine, and I have to admit I\\'m pretty glad to admit it\\'s the last. A new GTA game used to be an event, and the new games were always impressive in their scope and what they added to the series. But the gameplay has gotten tiring, and these ports of PSP titles don\\'t do much to stay fresh. A lot of the allure of the \"Stories\" PSP games is that you get to play GTA on a portable system. When you put the same game on PS2, that allure is gone. Liberty City Stories had the same problem, but it wasn\\'t as long, and so it didn\\'t wear out its welcome as much as this does. There\\'s nothing that really makes Vice City Stories inferior to LCS, it just feels even more played out. The city is familiar and Lance Vance is as irritating as ever. He\\'s seriously one of the worst game characters in existence. He has no redeeming qualities. He\\'s an idiot, not funny, and doesn\\'t help. All he usually does to a mission is make it harder than it needs to be. His brother, the guy you play is, is better, but not by much. As a person he\\'s not unlikable, but his motivations are a little messed up and it\\'s hard to care knowing he\\'s going to die in a couple years. That\\'s a big problem with both Stories games - finding the will to try when half the characters you\\'re protecting are going to get killed anyway. The biggest problem was right in the game - an extremely frustrating mission, the entire point of which is to save someone, which results in that character dying anyway. Gee, great.VCS does offer some stuff the original game doesn\\'t. Helpful additions like swimming, trip skip, being able to buy back confiscated weapons, et cetera make the experience less frustrating. Despite some shitty characters, the story is pretty decent and well-written, the radio stations are still hilarious, and they\\'re filled with lots of great 80\\'s songs. Visually, it\\'s improved a bit, with nice draw distances and lighting, plus the blur effect they introduced in San Andreas that happens when you\\'re going extremely fast. The load times are much better than the original games, but I wish they could have taken out the load between parts of the city. If they can stream all of San Andreas, they should be able to stream all of Vice City. There are some creative missions, but as usual, as it goes on it all devolves into a lot of shooting and exploding. The targeting continues to be terrible, and it\\'s just disgusting to see the final battles always playing out with you sprinting away a little bit to protect yourself and just holding down target and fire. I can\\'t wait for Grand Theft Auto IV, which looks to be more realistic, and hopefully will have a decent combat system. VCS is annoying sometimes, but it\\'s definitely not a bad game for $20.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Bone: Out From Boneville is based on the first volume of the Bone comic series by Jeff Smith and follows the adventures of Fone Bone and his two cousins, and is the first Bone game to be released by Telltale Games, with more to be released in episodic format. It is very rare that you will see a point-and-click game on the market, but Bone: Out From Boneville is just that. The main difference between this game and old games from the adventure game genre is that Bone takes point-and-click into full 3D and pulls it off very well.To move about you simply click to where you want to go and your character will move there. If you can walk somewhere your cursor will represent feet, eyes if it is to look at something and a pointing hand if you can interact with something in some way. Your inventory (with not much space in it) is represented by a backpack in the bottom left of your screen, which you can open simply by clicking on it. The fact that the way you control the character is very simple will appeal to all gamers, new or old.Of course, an adventure game is nothing without a decent plot, so you'll be happy to hear that Out From Boneville has one. At the beginning of the game you find out that Fone Bone (the character you control the most), Phoney Bone and Smiley Bone have been run out of their hometown Boneville due to Phoney Bone and his schemes to try and make money. The trio are lost in the desert and only have a badly drawn map to find out just where they are. However, the cousins are separated when a swarm of locusts comes up and attacks them. You are now in control of Fone Bone and you must now try and find your two cousins by talking too many lovable characters and visiting different locations.During the game you will meet many different characters - Thorn, Ted, a red dragon and more. But a main part about adventure games is the script and voice acting, due to the fact that you'll encounter a lot of it - so, is the script and voice acting any good? You bet it is. It is some of the best voice acting in recent games, especially from the likes of Ted and the rat monsters. The script is also funny and will actually have you laughing aloud at some points.The graphics in this Bone adventure are really smooth and represent the comic world nicely, which the game can get away with. The animations are also well done and nicely used throughout the game. There was only one minor problem during the game, where the heads of the characters were jumping about a lot, but this only happened about twice and doesn't remove from overall enjoyment of the game. The music is also superb, and that isn't said lightly. This is really some great music.There are two main playable characters in the game (ignoring when you control people like Ted for one minute) and they are Fone Bone and Phoney Bone. The game will have you play as Fone Bone to start with, meeting all the characters and getting to the desired location, and you'll then switch over to Phoney Bone and meet all the same characters your cousin did, with different reactions from them due to Phoney's behaviour. It's a nice feature to be able to go back and visit the places from a different point of view, and it surprisingly doesn't feel repetitive (because you don't have to spend as long as Fone Bone did in the places).The biggest letdown to the whole game is the fact it is just too short. Although you are only paying £6.50 for the game (which is a pretty good deal), you just feel as if the game should have gone on for a bit longer, probably double what it was (two hours). However, if you are looking for a good, quick game then Bone: Out From Boneville will be just fine.Bone: Out From Boneville is a brilliant first game from Telltale and the Bone series, and hopefully the game will retain its charm throughout the games to come. The only suggestion to improve the game is of course the length of it, which needs to be improved on quite a lot. Apart from that, Out From Boneville is a funny, solid game.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"In 2004 we saw the release of 3 major story driven games; Halo 2, Half Life 2, and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. While Halo 2 disappointed in the story department, Half Life 2 and GTA had amazing stories that cannot, I stress, CANNOT, be missed by any gamer, quite possibly ever. GTA did not have my favorite story out of the 2, but I have recently went back and finally finished it. The story in GTA is by far the best thing found in the game. Besides it being an incredibly fun game to play, having an amazing soundtrack and voice overs, I found most fun following the story, and I think I would have still enjoyed it more then those aspects if I was watching someone plow through the story. You play as Carl “CJ” Johnson, a man who escaped the troubles of street life by moving to Liberty City. He comes back 5 years later, because his mother has gotten killed. Once he arrives, he realizes his surroundings are more messed up then he thought of them to be. There are many twists in the story that will make you want to come back and play more. Mission structure also helps with the story. You will never (almost never) find yourself doing things twice. Mission's range from high speed Go-Kart chases, to bank heists.  There are 3 main cities in San Andreas; Los Santos, San Fierro and Las Venturas which represent Los Angeles, San Francisco and Las Vegas, respectively. They faithfully recreate whichever city they represent. You will see the all the major landmarks found in each of the cities, such as the Las Vegas Strip, which is represented as the Las Venturas Strip. All the cities will also have the districts found in their real life counterparts. You start the game in Ganton, which represents Compton in Los Angeles. The music in the game is superb. Like in the past GTA games, there are radio stations that you listen to in a vehicle. The radios range from rock of the early 90's rock and soul, to reggae and house. Whilst San Andreas' soundtrack isn't the best out of the previous titles, it definitely has a good one. GTA's voice overs are probably the best part about the audio. Many stars like Samuel L. Jackson, David Cross, Ice T, and Axl Rose being a DJ of the classic rock station make an appearance. It is really well written, and preformed even better. Gameplay in San Andreas is the same you'd expect from any GTA game. You run around, do missions, and when you're bored, you probably set yourself weird tasks like plowing through pedestrians, or using that really awesome bunny hop cheat that makes CJ go like 100 feet in the air on a bicycle. There have been a few things added to this formula, like RPG-esque stat building. You can work out at the different gyms in the game (although they are all the same) and build up your stamina by running on the treadmill or riding the stationary bike, and building up your muscle from the weights.By having higher stamina you can sprint farther, pedal longer on the bicycle, and swim at higher speeds longer. This time around, you can create custom outfits for your characters, unlike in the past games, where you had a preset outfit. “Pimping” out your car also makes an appearance in the game. You can drive to the Trans-Fender and you can choose what color you want on it, or what paint job you want done. You can put hydraulics on it, different wheels, and stuff alike. Be careful not to flip your car over though, the spontaneous combustion of flipped cars makes a return. Speaking of vehicles, there is a plethora of them in this game. There are nearly 200 vehicles, which is a big jump compared to Grand Theft Auto's approximated 85. They range from sports cars, to combine harvesters, to jet planes, to bicycles. Graphics in the Grand Theft Auto series have never been one of the series best features, and this game shows it. With games like Half Life 2 that came out in the same year, this game just looks like ass. The animations in the cinematic's look pretty spectacular, since they were motion captured, but the animations inside the actual game don't stand up so great. All the pedestrians walk the same way, only some of them differently. \\tI am running a low mid-ranged system in today's terms, and I was getting a good 35 – 40 frames per second. In conclusion, I think that Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is an amazing achievement in storytelling and gameplay, but could've used more polish in the graphics. I definitely consider this one of my favorite games of 2004.\",\n",

       "  'description': '\"The last one was fun, don\\'t get me wrong, but it was too short.\" is the first thing that\\'ll you hear spoken in the game, and for those of you clued in, you\\'ll realise that this is basically poking fun at the last game. Fans asked for a longer game, and Telltale has given us just that. Not only is the game almost double the previous episode, it also introduces some great new characters and locations.You\\'ll start off the game as Phoney Bone in a bar. As you wander around, you\\'ll discover that by a big coincidence, Smiley Bone is the bartender. All the Bone cousins get reunited; Fone Bone heads off to the Great Cow Race fair, while Phoney and Smiley Bone stay back at the bar as they have to work off a tab (Phoney has no eggs to pay with). At the fair Fone Bone must try and impress Thorn, while back at the bar Phoney Bone is plotting a scheme with Smiley to try and swindle the people of the town out of their eggs. Throughout the whole game there will be little cut scenes at random times, involving the Rat Creatures and a Grim Reaper-like character. It works really well, and it\\'s really cool to see the plot slowly unravel as the story goes along and more details are explained.A great feature of the game is the ability to switch between all three Bone cousins and play the different parts of the game with them. As Fone Bone you\\'ll be wandering around the fair and talking to the store owners while at the same time trying to impress Thorn, as Phoney Bone you\\'ll be trying to persuade the townspeople that they should definitely bet on a mystery cow, while Smiley Bone is busy making a cow costume. It\\'s neat to be able to play as who you want, when you want, and it feels really smooth as all three of their stories link together.A downside to the Sam and Max series was that many locations were repeated because of the episodic format of the series. Luckily, the second Bone game takes place in an entirely new place and so none of the environments are repeated, which really makes The Great Cow Race a refreshing experience and you won\\'t feel like you\\'ve seen it all before.Speaking of downsides, a small problem with Out From Boneville was that you couldn\\'t click on things and get a small comment from your character, like in adventure games \\'back in the day\\'. In The Great Cow Race you can click on other things than objects you can pick up, and your Bone character will make a comment about it - the best having to be Fone Bone exclaiming \"I think that\\'s the second biggest Pot O\\' Soup I\\'ve ever seen\".There is really nothing wrong with this Bone game, apart from the fact it is a tad easy for adventure game veterans due to the limited inventory and the pretty straightforward puzzles. This doesn\\'t mean you won\\'t be able to have fun playing the game. Whether the simplicity of the puzzles is a good or bad thing it\\'s really your preference.The last episode set high standards in the graphics and sound, and this episode retains that quality you expect and love. There are some new characters and with them come some great new voices. Luckily Ted the Bug is still in the game, because he\\'s such a quality character (the icons in the menu are based on him)!You can\\'t go wrong with this game. It\\'s good, it\\'s well priced and it\\'s simply fun to play. It improves on Out From Boneville in every single way and makes the Bone series a definite buy for all adventure gamers. The story is slowly building up and becoming more interesting, so let\\'s just hope the third game keeps up the good work!',\n",

       "  'description': 'Any fears I had about this game being pared down were unwarranted. Yes, the  developers had to cut a few corners to fit the PSP, but its still God of War  through and through. On the PSP. To a fan of the series, nothing more needs to  be said; don\\'t think, just buy. The graphics are top-notch and look great on the  small screen, easily the best looking PSP game to date. My previous complaint  about the backgrounds looking slightly plain are unfounded. I don\\'t know if it  was just the demo version or what, but the full game has great backgrounds that  give the same sense of scope and believability as its big brothers on the PS2.  The sound is equally amazing, and with headphones on, you get completely sucked  into the world. And the gameplay is just as gory and brutal as you could hope.  The atmosphere that is created with all three of these makes you feel like such  a frickin badass that it easily holds your interest the whole way through, even  if the story this time is a little less interesting.Being a prequel,  this game feels more like \"the further adventures of Kratos\" than anything else.  Which isn\\'t a bad thing, but the story doesn\\'t really get interesting until  pretty much the end of the game, where we finally get to the part that focuses  on Kratos\\' daughter. Without saying too much, it is good to get some more  background and insight into Kratos\\' tortured soul and really makes you feel  sorry for him. At the end, you totally understand the Ghost of Sparta\\'s rage and  it makes you want to kick some ass every time you play him.Taken on its  own, this is easily the most fun you\\'ve ever had on the PSP. It\\'s only when  compared to its console counterparts that you start to see the thin cracks and  compromises that were made. While the combat itself is satisfying, the controls  and progression are slightly off. The tiny nub of a joystick on the PSP simply  cannot compare to a real analog stick and at first, it is awkward having to hold  both shoulder buttons in order to execute a barrel roll. Once you get used to it  however, it works well, becoming automatic and second nature. Overall, Ready at  Dawn did a surprisingly good job of mapping everything to the PSP\\'s controls and  squeezing in as much of the PS2 game\\'s play mechanics as they possibly could.  Progressing through the game is possibly the weakest link in the chain (sorry,  couldn\\'t resist). Chains of Olympus is even more linear than the first two  adventures and the puzzle elements are extremely easy. I only got stuck once for  more than 20 seconds. Also, there are way, WAY more instances of being blocked  off in a chamber by red force fields and being made to clear the room of enemies  before you are able to proceed. Again, not necessarily a crippling flaw, it just  makes the progression seem a bit forced and controlled. On the plus side, the  second weapon that you eventually get not only has a useful purpose this time  around, but its actually really fun to use! In fact, there are certain enemies,  especially in the Challenge of Hades, that are more easily dealt with using this  additional weapon.The only other negative things would be length and  difficulty. Unless I was careless, I didn\\'t really die all that often. No doubt  my experience with the first two God of War games helped with this, but it still  felt easier. I finished the game in just over 7 hrs on Hero (Medium) difficulty  and got all the hidden chests (which btw, are much less hidden this time  around). I may go back and try to complete the game again on God Mode and finish  the Challenge of Hades, but it probably won\\'t take me much longer than  that.In summary, if you compare Chains of Olympus to the first outings,  it comes off a bit like God of War Lite in a couple aspects. Which, make no  mistake, still isn\\'t bad at all. However, if you take it for what it is on the  PSP, you will see it for what it really is; the most bloody, engrossing, and  downright fun 7 hrs you\\'ll ever spend with a portable game system. If you at all  enjoyed Kratos\\' antics in the past, you should need no more convincing.',\n",

Included with these two characters are two new stages, Green Hill Zone, which any Sonic fan knows and loves, is here; as well as Shadow Moses Island which is a great addition. You might be thinking, how can Nintendo put in a Gun wielding military style fighter to go head-to-head with cute little Kirby? It's a mystery to me, but it works. Also a new addition is the online multiplayer, which is very welcomed. Part of the problem with Super Smash Bros 64 and Melee were that once you didn't have anybody to play with, it became boring. Now that you can connect with worldwide players over Nintendo's Wi-Fi connection. The online play is mostly lag-free, which is remarkable. This game will keep you occupied for a long, long time. What also makes this game so amazing is all of Nintendo's most famous and well known characters being jam packed into one game. Not only does this make more dormant characters in Nintendo's games more popular, but it also makes you want to buy the games for some of those dormant characters as well. In Brawl, each character has a new final smash attack which is activated by a final smash orb. Final smashes can switch the outcome of the game, and keep the game alive and active. To activate your final smash attack, you must run around on the screen chasing the orb frantically trying to knock all the life out of it before your opponents do. What keeps this fresh is if a person gets the final smash but does not activate it, if an opponent hurts you enough, you unintentionally release the orb and try to chase it again. On top of all of this, there is an adventure mode. Nintendo had an adventure mode in Super Smash Bros. Melee, but it was very generic, and redundant. The new adventure mode is called the Subspace Emissary, and Nintendo probably changed the name because once people heard that the Adventure mode from Melee was returning, they might not purchase the game because Melee's adventure sucked so much. The Subspace Emissary is fun for a while, but then it feels like a chore. A long, 8-10 hour chore which becomes really boring if you're trying to play it in one sitting. This mode can be played with a friend, and if it is, it makes it go by a lot quicker. The Subspace Emissary was very hyped up and Nintendo says they put a lot of effort into it, which is mainly only visible by the cutscenes. Where to start with the cutscenes? They're beautiful, compelling, fun, and make you feel like you're watching a movie. The cutscenes provide the best graphics on the Wii to this date, and without them, this adventure would feel like cleaning up your room. However, the cutscenes do not make up for all the wasted potential in the Subspace Emissary. The rest of the mode feels like a average sidescroller with no story (there is no clear story) and lasts too long, except towards the end where it actually feels like a bare plot is included which is actually enjoyable. The only reason I reccomend to play it through is to unlock all of the characters without having to play an insane amount of VS matches. This game has an insane amount of things to unlock. Stickers, trophies, stages, and music make you want to complete this game. If you're one of those people who loves to collect everything in a game, you will be here for a long time. The amounts of stages in this game is ridiculous. There are a few from Melee, and a lot of new stages to keep you occupied. On Smashville, a new stage taken from Animal Crossing, at 8PM on Saturday nights if you play there, Totakeke (K.K. Slider) will make a live performance. Neat, huh? Brawl also has a stage editor. It isn't too fancy, but barely gets the job done. You can put any music you have collected into a custom stage. Every day, Nintendo selects a stage and distributes it throught it's WiiConnect24 service so every user can try it. Keep submitting and maybe you will get lucky! All in all, even though I did bash the Subspace Emissary, Super Smash Bros. Brawl makes your Wii worth the purchase. Before this, only games like Super Mario Galaxy and Metroid Prime: Corruption stopped my Wii from collecting dust. With so many different things to do in this game, it is a must buy for Wii owners. Guess where I'm going to be Saturday night?\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Ok assassins creed is one a game which will be remembered for a long time.Firsly the graphics are amazing, I think its the best graphical game to date, everything from Altair to the massive environment with leaves growing from trees tall buildings which dont lose texture and the many people populating the holy land not many of them copies of each other.The sound in assassins creed is excellent. great voice acting by all the characters, sword fights sound great and realistic, and one cool feature of the game is ramdom people say stuff when they see you running and climbling.Storyline wise is awsome. You actually play as two people, the game is actually set in the future and you are Desmond who is really an assassin 9he doesnt know it) and the main doctor who is experimentinng on him is a templer (the assassins arch rivels). Desmond can go back to his ancester memories which is where most of the game takes place.Gameplay of assassins creed is good. Basically you undergo a mission which turns out badly and you get stripped of your rank and all throughtout the game you are trying to restore it by doing other assassinations throught 3 cities in the holy land. Right the bit why people dont like this game is they say it is repetitive. well it is to some extend but you will want to play the game anyway to see how all the story pans out.The map is HUGE on assassins creed which provides awsome free roming experience where you can just kill guards for fun (which is one of the best features of the game).It doesnt really have any reply value but there is a ton of flags (420) to collect and templers to kill (60).Control wise is does it good job. you can easily climb any climbable surface at will just by holding down one button and the controls used for combat worked well too.Overall assassins creed is the best graphical game to date and it just proves how good next gen consoles are. I would recommand it to anyone. Seriously get this game!! ',\n",

       " {'deck': 'The Darkness',\n",
       "  'description': 'The Darkness is based on a comic by Top Cow Productions, although it seems significantly different in visual style. Starbreeze Studios reworked the concept to work better in a first person shooter, and spent more time with the mafia aspect and World War I setting than the more supernatural stuff. The Darkness comes off of Starbreeze\\'s previous hit, The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay, a prequel to the Vin Diesel movies.The Darkness is a fun game, although the shooting action itself isn\\'t all that good. Apparently that\\'s a quirk of Starbreeze, they make good first person shooters without good shooting. From what I\\'ve gathered, Butcher Bay succeeded because of atmosphere, graphics, and hand-to-hand combat, while The Darkness succeeds because of atmosphere, graphics, and the darkness powers. They just make you feel like a badass and add immensely to the experience. Which scenario sounds cooler?1) A door opens, and a man walks through and shoots the other men inside the room.2) A door opens and a sharp black spike darts in, smashing out all the lights in the room, covering it in shadow. An ominous figure walks in with the appearance of a man, but he has several demonic appendages protruding from him, including two ravenous-looking snake-like creatures. The man dispatches the others in the room with his guns and lashing, impaling tentacles. When it is over, the two creatures greedily consume the hearts of the fallen.Other cool touches include Jackie, the protagonist, merely dropping his pistols and pulling out new ones when they\\'re out of ammo, and the brutal \"execution\" moves he performs when right next to the enemy. The game\\'s not all just violence though. If you want, you can spend time helping out the normal citizens you see around you, and there are plenty of calmer, even tender moments, like going to see Jackie\\'s girlfriend at her new apartment and watching To Kill A Mockingbird together (The PS3 version includes this and other movies, plus some cartoons and music videos, in their entirety on various televisions in the game world). They really try to immerse you in this world, which can help gloss over some of the other flaws and adds to the success of the story.The plot has two main threads, as Jackie deals with his traitorous uncle Paulie and the Darkness inside him that is trying to control him. The two are mixed well, and it moves along with generally good voice acting and presentation. The conclusion is a bit... inconclusive, though not totally unsatisfying. The sound design is pretty good, with nice music and effective sound effects. Some of the textures look bad up close and the people can look a bit weird, but generally the graphics, lighting and overall visual quality are quite good. The game can be a bit glitchy, and the core gameplay isn\\'t quite as solid as you might like, but thanks to the peripheral touches it\\'s a good experience. It\\'s also a very funny game, the main story is very serious (and well, dark), but there are lots of humorous phone messages, posters, and NPC conversations sprinkled throughout. The story might be a bit short, but you should at least try the game if you\\'re interested.',\n",

       " {'deck': \"Rusty's Partners in Time Review\",\n",
       "  'description': \"After 2003's Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga, I didn't really know what to expect from 2005's sequel, Mario & Luigi Partners in Time. I wasn't sure that they could top off my favorite game of 2003, they didn't exactly do that in this sequel, but they did make a really fun and interesting RPG for the DS. The game starts off introducing you to the main bad guys of this game, the Shroobs. The Shroobs are a weird spin off of the Toads. They are small purple beings, with mushroom hats colored purple with white dots. The game introduction takes place in the Mushroom Kingdom past. The Shroobs sought a new home, and they set their gaze on the Mushroom Kingdom. For the first 5 – 10 minutes of the game, you take control of Baby Mario and Luigi, as you get taught how to battle. The first battle in the game pits you against Baby Bowser, who is set to kidnap the Baby Princess Peach. After you defeat him, the Shroobs start attacking the castle. You are then taken to current day Mushroom Kingdom, where you learn that Professor E. Gadd has invented a time machine to run on the Cobalt Star, and Princess Peach being the dummy she that she is, jumps into the time machine and travels to the past. A few moments later, the time machine returns, only to be broken up and instead of containing Princess Peach, it contains a Shroob. So Princess Peach is missing, and you being Mario have to go rescue her.  After traveling through the first time hole to the past, you will find Baby Mario and Baby Luigi, and you will become a team of 4 to rescue the princess. The script was well written, but I do not think that it was as good and funny as the previous game in the series. But its still a good and engaging story that makes you want to keep on going until the final 3 boss battles (ZOMG SPOILAR?) The Mario and Luigi sprites seem recycled from the last game, but all the other sprites look very good. There are a lot of characters in the game, and if they are NPCs, they will not have a repeating look to them. The enemies you fight are repetitive to one area. The backgrounds are done very nice, and suit the environment that they are in. They do repeat themselves throughout the environment that you are in, so it might start to feel stale after a while. The overall look of the game is very nice. The colors are vibrant and no one level feels very dark and Gothic, even the ones that try to look so. The game sounds like a Mario game, which is really great. It doesn't veer off the series sound course, which is the regular happy jingles you've come to know and expect. It can get a bit repetitive in some spots, as it keeps on looping. Its no big deal, you will get used to it. This game is a turn-based RPG, but it is not one one of those, “press and watch” games. There is 1 set of attacks for Mario and Luigi, and there are 2 sets of attacks for Baby Mario and Baby Luigi. Mario and Luigi can jump attack, and Baby Mario and Baby Luigi can jump attack, and hammer attack. There also is another attack they can do, and to do it, they need to have a Bros. Item. These items replaced the Bros. Points from the last game. Bros. Items are items that you can find while playing the game, that make your team of 4 do an attack together. These attacks do more damage than the single attacks, so they are really good when you have hard enemies around you. They start easy, but as you combo up a higher damage rate, they get harder and harder. An easy example of this is the first Bros. Item you get, the Green Shell. Mario and Luigi both kick the shell back and forth, racking up the damage, and the shell gets progressively faster. As with every RPG, your characters progress levels, and they get points to distribute to attributes. The categories available to receive points are Health Points, Power, Speed, Defense, and Stache, which raises your ability to get Lucky hits. After you get your points distributed, you will receive a bonus point raise. You choose the category you want to raise higher, the spinner starts spinning, you stop it on a number, and you get that much bonus. All in all, I really enjoyed this sequel to Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga. The story could use a little bit of work, but it's still a memorable experience. If you have a DS, I recommend you to pick it up, and if you haven't played Superstar Saga, pick that up too.\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'A gem lost in its own time, Final Fantasy V is a stellar RPG.',\n",
       "  'description': 'In the three years between the release of Final Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy VI (known as Final Fantasy II and III in the US), Squaresoft made the decision not to release Final Fantasy V to North America. They felt that the gameplay was too complex and wasn’t accessible enough for the western world. This is a real shame, because the depth of FFV’s character customization is its greatest asset and keeps it from being just an also-ran in the franchise.  Some installments of the Final Fantasy series are revered for their great storytelling. This installment certainly isn’t. The main story uses the all-too-familiar plot involving powerful crystals, worlds colliding, and an ancient evil escaping his prison, with only your ragtag group of adventurers being capable of saving the world. Some of the better games in the series drop a lot of those cliches and at least attempt to be novel or compelling.  This isn\\'t as damning as it sounds. Though the paint-by-numbers story is uninteresting, it provides enough of an impetus for you to traipse around the world map, battling hordes of enemies every three or four steps. Combat is based around the Active Time Battle (ATB) system, which mixes turn-based combat with the need for quick thinking and fast reflexes. During battle, each character has a bar that fills up every couple of seconds. Once full, you can select your attack. At the same time, the enemies lie in wait, their own ATB gauge creeping towards action. If you take too long to choose an action, they’ll pounce. Once you and your enemies attack, the cycle begins anew until your party, or all of the the monsters are dead. The system works very well, and keeps combat brisk despite the downtime of waiting for your characters’ gauges to fill. Why this is so rewarding? After battle, your characters gain the standard experience points and gil, but in this game they also gain a few “ABP.” These precious points are the key to unlocking your party’s true potential.  Previous Final Fantasies had little in the way of character customization. Your characters each had predefined classes, like paladins, white mages, and ninjas. You could only gain new abilities in those classes, and they were simply given to you as you leveled up. FFV, however, rethinks this philosophy by reusing the Job system introduced in FFIII. Rather than the game assigning a specific class to your characters, you can freely change your characters\\' classes, or \"jobs\" as they\\'re called, whenever you want. There are pros and cons to each job, and finding the right mix is a challenge that you’ll face throughout the game. As you might expect, each job has its own abilities. While thieves have incredible agility, can steal items, and keep the party from being ambushed, monks attack twice per round, automatically counterattack when hit, and have an kick that hits all enemies. In most cases, you automatically gain a job\\'s abilities when you equip it. There’s a twist, though, that provides a tremendous amount of depth to the job system. This is where ABP comes in.  Besides your current job’s innate abilities, you also have a spare ability slot that you can fill with any skill that you’ve already learned from any other job. By vanquishing your enemies and collecting ABP, your character learns the equipped job\\'s abilities and can transfer them to his or her other jobs. If you want a white mage that can steal items, you simply equip the thief job, kill a bunch of monsters until you gain 50 ABP, switch to the white mage job, and then equip the \"Steal\" ability.\\xa0 Imagine how complex that system becomes after you master dozens of abilities. By the end of the game, all four characters are capable of attacking eight times per round while using weapons imbued with Flare. They’ll automatically counterattack when hit, have double their normal hit points, and be able to use any equipment in the game. Sure, they’re overpowered. But it hardly feels cheap.\\xa0 You\\'ll have spent a lot of time to build up your characters, so there\\'s a great sense of accomplishment when you can unleash your unstoppable wrecking crew.  The world is generally lush and green, and looks very pretty.\\xa0 Each character is animated nicely, and the enemy sprites are very detailed and are sufficiently scary-looking. You’ll travel through a nice variety of locales, including forests, mountains, caves, fields, deserts, underwater, and finally an alien-looking environment. There’s a variety of background music and sound effects, each of which are fine, but none of which are terribly memorable. The overall presentation is top-notch, true to Square\\'s pedigree, and complements the battle and job systems nicely.  You might take for granted that a FF game is always worth the money you’ll spend on it. After all, these games usually last anywhere between 30 and 40 hours, with plenty of sidequests to beat, items to acquire, and secret places to visit. FFV doesn’t buck any of these trends, but you’ll spend proportionally more time leveling up than you might be used to. Again, this is time well spent as you master your 20-plus jobs. Additionally, the GBA port also includes a secret dungeon that you can complete after beating the game once, as well as four new jobs. The new jobs have some very interesting and unique abilities that you probably haven\\'t seen before, and are definitely worth collecting. The optional dungeon adds quite a bit of content to the game and is worth checking out after beating the main quest.  Despite its relatively weak narrative, Final Fantasy V should have been released to North America during the SNES days. This installment is combat-heavy and focuses a lot of its attention on the job system. Fortunately, both elements are very well developed and provide enough incentive to see this game through to the end. Though this game is 15 years-old, you\\'ll not only enjoy FFV, you\\'ll appreciate how it influenced more recent Final Fantasy installments, like FF Tactics, FFXI, and FFX-2.',\n",

       "  'description': \"I played a few demos in the past, but I never really sat down and played a Tomb Raider game before because I didn't have a PS1 and the first one on PS2 was terrible. But I got a demo disc a while ago with this on it, and found I actually enjoyed it quite a bit. It had some nice Prince of Persia-style platforming and puzzle solving (minus the ability to rewind and slow down time), with some decent shooting, and seemed pretty cool. I didn't end up getting the whole game until recently, but it was definitely worth the low price.I'm not sure why this is, but the supernatural story of the game seems out of place to me. I know the series has always had weird stuff like dinosaurs, it just seems like the fiction they're trying to create doesn't jibe well with all the strange magical crap that happens. It's not a problem if you just decide to accept that there's an extremely ancient and powerful sword that everyone's after and enjoy it. Anyway, Lara's quest has her trekking around the globe looking for pieces to the puzzle. Some places are ancient shrines and caves, others are more modern places of business. The gameplay is largely the same regardless of setting, as you explore the environment, push some blocks, avoid traps, and shoot a lot of bad guys. There are some driving sequences and boss battles, although neither are especially compelling. There are also several button-timing sequences, which have become altogether too common in modern action games. They're really not very interesting any more, and I hope the fad dies down soon. The game's a bit short, although the fact that I didn't want it to end yet suggests the game itself was pretty fun just to play.The game looks and sounds pretty nice, with good character models, impressive environments, and pretty solid voice acting. It makes the game a little better when the protagonist is good. In addition to being nice to look at (for a computer-generated image), Lara is intelligent and witty. The developers made a strong point of trying to make the mystery she's solving relevant to her past, and the end results are a bit amateurish but she's still a strong, sympathic character. The game shouldn't amaze anyone, but it's definitely quite an enjoyable eight hours.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Sam (a shamus canine) and Max (a hyperkinetic rabbity thing) are Freelance Police and are based on the comics created by Steve Purcell. Hit the Road is their toughest case yet as they have been hired to find an escaped Bigfoot from a carnival. You then control Sam and Max as they work their way around locations to find and solve clues to what's happened to Bruno, the escaped Bigfoot.The game interface is a simple one to get the hang of. You click on things to interact with them, but what you do with the objects depends on what action you've selected (look, use, and so on) which you can select by right clicking your mouse to scroll through the options. It is however more easier simply to press the key on the keyboard that corresponds to the action, which will be the first letter of each action. This is a quick and easy way to do things and is easy for people new to adventure games to grasp.The puzzles in the game are hard, and some of them will have you trying to figure out for a while. This game will especially be hard for new adventure game players, because as the veterans know, you must check out every possible object and see if you can pick it up encase it comes in handy later on in the game and you must talk to every character to get as much information as possible. Some of the puzzles will get you frustrated if you aren't sure where you're meant to be heading (the Tunnel of Love for example), but once you've solved the puzzles you're stuck on, it does sort of make sense.Graphically the game isn't exactly a stunner in this day and age, but that doesn't mean this game isn't good looking. As long as you can go into this game not expecting highly detailed graphics and just appreciate the game for the fact it looked superb 'back in the day' The environments are also well designed, such as Bumpusville and the baffling, but brilliant, Mystery Vortex (one room will have you standing on your head!). The game is bursting with witty humour and hilarious comments from Max and dry sarcasm from Sam. There are also some nice 'hidden' jokes such as putting money down the well and making the game supposedly end, and making Sam pick up something that just can't be picked up. The humour is also helped tremendously by the voice acting, which is great for all characters, not just the Freelance Police.Throughout the game you can also pick up items which are actually mini-games. There is a battleships type game, but with cars, there is a game where you can dress up Sam & Max and there is a game which sees you smacking rats when they pop out the holes. Although not exactly an amazing feature, it is a nice distraction from the main game.Sam & Max Hit the Road doesn't really have any downsides at all, unless you just want easy puzzles that you can zoom through and complete the game as quickly as possible. A tiny downside was that if you play with the text on, it is hard to get the speed of the text to go along with the characters, as it'll either go ever so slightly slower, or slightly faster, but this is only when a character is talking for a long time without another character jumping in (which is rare).LucasArts have really made a classic game and sets high standards for all adventure games. The characters, story, humour... everything is really great and it'll just want you to play it again and again to make sure you haven't missed anything out such as any dialogue or jokes. No adventurer gamer is complete without this game on their shelf.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'The original Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic was a landmark RPG for the Xbox and a remarkable game in pretty much every way possible.\\xa0 KOTOR applied Bioware\\'s proven RPG chops to the exciting mythos of the \"galaxy far, far away\" and gave the rabid Star Wars fan base a game that was worthy of the franchise\\'s name. It certainly wasn’t surprising that LucasArts would want to capitalize on that success by releasing a sequel quickly. A scant one year after KOTOR hit shelves, fledgling studio Obsidian Entertainment takes over the reigns of the series and delivers us Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords. While Obsidian’s team had a good RPG pedigree prior to forming their own studio, their first combined effort meets with mixed results. The Sith Lords contains most of the same great elements of the first game, but it\\'s obvious that the sequel was rushed and doesn\\'t have quite the exciting punch of the original.  Shortly after the events of KOTOR, the Jedi ranks are decimated by their war with the Sith, and a new shadowy threat creeps across the galaxy, wiping out the last vestiges of the order. As you awake out of stasis on a strange vessel, you find that you are not only the last living Jedi, you\\'re the last living person on the ship. You\\'re naked and weak; all of your equipment, all of your friends, and even your command of the Force are lost. Your situation is dire; escaping the dead craft is your first step to finding out why your ship was destroyed, why you can’t control the Force, and why it seems like the entire galaxy wants you dead.  Though The Sith Lords\\' story is a bit different than KOTOR, this opening eerily mirrors the beginning of the original. You\\'ll recall that you\\'re awakened in KOTOR, naked and powerless, on a Republic vessel under attack. As you progressed through KOTOR, you unlocked latent Jedi abilities, and your forgotten past, en route to challenging the mighty Sith and ending their war on the Republic. As you progress through The Sith Lords, the story follows a very similar vein. While you don\\'t have amnesia this time around, you do spend much of the game remembering the decisions that brought you to reject the Force and walk away from the Jedi. It\\'s still an interesting story, and the plot is more personal than KOTOR’s, but it just feels like you\\'re replaying the same game again. Ultimately, the game is disappointing as you travel around the galaxy, revisiting the same places that you went, and following the same story that Revan did in the first game.  There is one element of the story which does stand apart and is by far the most interesting piece to the plot\\'s puzzle. Your first companion, an old blind woman named Kreia, is an intriguing character throughout and will give you pause many times to consider the path that you are taking. She is a thinly disguised Jedi, but her allegiance to the Light Side of the Force is tentative at best. While she is far from the best fighter you\\'ll acquire, you might find that you\\'ll keep her in your party to see how she\\'ll react to what you do. She questions your altruistic decisions to fight other people\\'s fights or give a hand out to a beggar. However, she also chastises you for bloodthirsty acts of violence and deception where it isn\\'t called for. As you engage her more and more, you discover a rich history to this woman, and start picking out bits of her sometimes dark past. Kreia is an amazing and deep character and is a breath of fresh air to what is mostly a stale game.  The rest of your companions are less interesting, but serviceable. During the course of the adventure, you\\'ll pick up a group comprised of the standard Star Wars character types. This includes a female bounty hunter, a naive monk-like fighter, a crazed Wookie, a scruffy Han Solo wannabe, a shady criminal boss, and a couple of others. You\\'ll also be reunited with HK-47, the assassin droid from KOTOR, whose villainous demeanor and dismissal of humans as \"meatbags\" is still hilarious; conversations with him are always entertaining. You\\'ll engage each party member in conversation to bring out their pasts, but there\\'s more to the dynamic this time around. KOTOR didn\\'t really reward you for talking to your companions, except for maybe getting an item or some experience. In The Sith Lords, on the other hand, choosing the right conversation path will lead your companions to grow closer to you, which changes their Light Side/Dark Side alignment to match up closer to yours. If you can get these people to bond closely enough with you, you may have the option of converting them to Jedi. By the end of the game, your party will become a Jedi wrecking crew, slicing through all but the strongest enemies. Putting another few lightsabers in the hands of your three man team is incentive enough to speak with your companions, draw out their history, and open their eyes to the Force. Like KOTOR, every character in the game has full voiceover for their dialogue, and the actors\\' skills are very impressive throughout.  Beyond getting to know your companions, you\\'ll spend a lot of time wandering from area to area, talking to people and taking on various quests. They are the standard mix of fetch quests, assassination missions, and a few \"talking quests\" where you\\'ll try to resolve a dispute by getting each person\\'s side and acting as an arbitrator. Like KOTOR, these quests are well done in making you feel that your actions have real consequences. A key battle on Dantooine involves you being recruited to protect a settlement from marauding bandits. You can choose to help the settlement or to let the bandits pay you off to sabotage it. This seemingly random quest is one major milestone that changes a pivotal confrontation you\\'ll have later in the game. Like KOTOR, The Sith Lords is worth a second playthrough, just to see how the story changes when you choose the Light Side or Dark Side.  Combat was an exciting part of KOTOR, so The Sith Lords doesn\\'t mess with its successful formula much. Combat still takes place in a hybrid real-time, turn-based setting. You can pause at any time to give orders to your party, or just sit back and let them wade into the fray and hack away at the enemy. There\\'s a lot of turn taking, number crunching, and hidden dice rolls happening behind the scenes, but combat still looks fluid and dramatic, especially when two lightsaber wielding foes square off. Several different lightsaber styles are added to the mix, and add a bit more depth to saber combat. You\\'ll learn these different styles during your adventure, which offer a number of bonuses and penalties to different categories like parrying, blocking blaster fire, and dealing with multiple enemies. Each style has a couple of new animations to add some visual flourish to your fights. Blasters still feel useless, as many of your enemies carry melee weapons and will close the distance before you get more than a shot or two off. While that\\'s a bit off-putting, you likely won\\'t care since you know it\\'s only a matter of time before you switch to exclusively using lightsabers anyway.  However, combat also exposes The Sith Lords most glaring problem. This game was developed in a very short period of time, and it shows. Where elements were recycled from KOTOR, the game is smooth and looks as good as the original. The pieces that Obsidian added lack a lot of polish. More effects were added to combat to spice up the visuals, but they wind up dragging down the framerate to abysmal levels when multiple attacks, force powers, and grenades are all onscreen.\\xa0 By the end of the game, it feels as though you\\'re trying to play The Sith Lords on an underpowered PC rather than a console. The cutscenes in the game look awful, with jerky animation and a surprising lack of visual and auditory punch. New areas and textures are dull and flat, and some of the new characters simply look ugly. There\\'s also quite a few conversations that infinitely loop where it doesn\\'t make sense, and you\\'ll probably get caught in a conversation that will freeze up the game, forcing you to restart from your last save. These issues are all unfortunate, especially because any of them could have easily been cleared up during testing if given time.  “Rushed but good” is the most accurate description for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords. Throughout most of the game, you follow the same path as you did in KOTOR, more or less, while occasionally running into bugs and technical limitations that could\\'ve been resolved in quality assurance testing.\\xa0 Some of the pieces of the story show glimmers of greatness, but one year isn\\'t enough time for a new developer to start from scratch and recapture the spirit of KOTOR without merely mimicking it. The Sith Lords is still a very good game, but it could\\'ve easily been a great one if Obsidian had more time to make it great.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Episode Two continues the story from the previous games, pushing the narrative forward in ways it hasn't been before. For it's time, the original game was pretty impressive in its immersion but now is very limited and a bit simple. The sequel took huge steps forward in presentation and upped the ante quite a bit with consistent characters, but was still a little basic. The first episodic expansion really raised the bar with its development of Alyx as a believable and likable character, and she's maybe the best ever in a video game. This game takes big steps forward in adding intrigue and surprises to the plot, with more than one shocking moment. It's still not as smooth as a good movie, as plenty of little things can break the illusion, but it's still quite a feat for the medium.What really matters is the gameplay and not the story though, and Half-Life still excels in this area. Valve hasn't added a new weapon since 2, but that's not the only way you can mix things up. They've added a couple new enemies that require brand new combat tactics, including one that's especially interesting, the Hunters. They announce their presence in dramatic fashion and are a very intimidating foe while still being beatable. They do get annoying in the final climax when they prevent you from accomplishing your goal, but are still pretty cool. The balance between combat and puzzle-solving is still fantastic, as you never spend too much time on a specific kind of experience. It's a lot of fun just cruising from location to location in the new vehicle, seeing what there is to see, before the next big battle happens. The Vortigaunts are given a spotlight in the second episode, and they make a pretty effective and intriguing ally. The added achievements maybe caused me to spend too much time playing in a specific way to unlock them, but they still add some satisfaction to your progression. The last big battle is one of the best designed large combat sequences I've ever played, that combines the skills of driving, Hunter combat, gravity gun use, and precise aiming in a way that is exhilarating while maintaining a manageable difficulty. As part of the high-value Orange Box, it's something truly worth seeing.\",\n",

Vice city stories see's the return of many characters including Diaz, Lance and even Umberto who lives in his own house.

Like other GTA games this will take a while to complete 100%, heck even the story missions are quite long compared to other GTA games.If you have anyone to play with the multiplayer modes are fun even with just two people. There are a lot of modes to choose from so there will be something for everyone.Overall this is a must for psp owners and provides a lost chapter in the GTA series!\",\n",

       "  'description': 'If it seems that Sam & Max haven\\'t been gone for long, it\\'s because they haven\\'t. It was only a short while ago that the crime-fighting duo were on the moon, fighting to save the world. Now they are back, and this time Telltale have really sharpened up the game to give off one of their best adventures yet.The game starts off differently than you might expect. Sam is sure that their pet fish is up to something, until it suddenly gets zapped by a laser - as does the wall, creating a hole to see Flint Paper. It turns out a robot is destroying their neighbourhood, and so Sam & Max go out of the office to go talk to him. After solving a quick puzzle the robot dies and the introductory credits start, which have been redesigned for the new season; there is also a small interactive bit in it which sees you shooting a couple of things.The plot is just what you\\'ve come to expect from a Sam & Max game - crazy. Santa is sending inappropriate gifts to children and is holding all his elves at gunpoint, refusing to come out of his room quietly. The overall plot is really well thought out and features one really big twist, just as you think everything is over. Nothing is given away as to what the overall season plot is going to be, but there are enough things to keep you guessing.At the start of the game when the robot was destroying the street, things got chucked around (including Sybil\\'s) which gives the street a whole new look. Bosco\\'s is now right next to the office, and Stinky\\'s (the new diner) is now next to Bosco\\'s. This new street design works really well, but hopefully things will be added to it as the season moves along, otherwise it\\'ll \"get old, fast\".In total the game is going to last you around four to five hours if you go around and explore everything and pick every dialogue option. This length is really solid and really worth your money. The difficulty of the game is spot on, which owes a bit of thanks to the new hint system. You can select five different levels of hints (ranging from none to frequent), in which Max will randomly chirp up with lines slyly suggesting what to do next. It\\'s a good touch for people who don\\'t know what to do.Graphically there are no obvious improvements from last season, except the addition of widescreen support and some really nice animations, which really shine in the cut scenes. You\\'ll be amazed at how smoothly everything runs and the attention to detail on the character\\'s facial and body expressions.The voice acting is just what you\\'ve come to expect from Telltale. All the new characters (Santa, Flint Paper and Stinky to name a few) are well casted and fit their design perfectly. Even speech from all the regulars seems to be better than usual. The only minor downside on the voices is the quality of the recordings, only noticeable on the dominant \\'s\\' sounds in some words - but this is only very minor.Along with this issue, there is also a problem with the driving sequence. When you are driving along the street, with objects such as Tortue-Me-Elmers and other stuff flying at the screen, there is a drop in frame rate on even the high specification systems. It is only a small drop and doesn\\'t make the driving and harder or less enjoyable because of it, but it is small enough to notice.As this is a Christmas game there is lots of Christmas music which has been beautifully crafted. It\\'ll have you standing around in locations not doing anything while you just listen to the music - should there be a soundtrack for this season, you really need to snap it up.There are loads of little touches that just wrap this game up and put a nice bow on it. The COPs settings changer at the start, the mini-games and the easter eggs just to name a few. This is a down-right amazing episode of Sam & Max and is sure to leave you drooling in anticipation for what Telltale have up their sleeve for episode two.',\n",

       "  'description': 'The Darkness is one of those games that no one expects to be THAT good, but I was very suprised when I played it. The game as a whole is very cohesive and well-done, I am suprised by the quality of such a game. The story is you are a member of a modern mafia who gets these \"darkness\" powers on your 21st birthday. A lot of stuff evolves from there, and the story can be very violent and just sick at times. If you have heard about the \"break-up\" between your girlfriend in the game and you, you know what I mean. For those who don\\'t, it was extremely powerful and rivals some of the most intense scenes seen in cinema. It is a very good scene that is well-deserved on Game Informer\\'s \"Top Ten Moments of 2007\" list. Basically, the story is very good and serves as an excellent backdrop to the gameplay. In fact, the story is some of the best of last year, and, unfortunately, games like Mass Effect and BioShock stole the spotlight when award season came for story telling.The gameplay, on the most part, is excellent. Some people have criticized the gunplay, but I feel that the shooting in this game is very realistic and unique for the genre. All guns have laser sights and you use them to aim, and there is a assistive auto-aim that aids with shooting from a distance. The guns in this game are standard fare, but still a lot of fun to shoot. AKs, shotguns, battle rifles, TMPs, and a LOT of pistols are what you shoot for the most part, and it works very well. The whole premise about the game, however, is the Darkness powers, and they are some of the most unique gameplay innovations of last year, portal gun included. There are different powers, like \"Demon Arm\" which is impaling weapon of sorts that can basically spear any enemy in close range (it is awesome). \"Black Hole\" is also pretty cool as it can send a black hole in the middle of an enemy crowd and you can watch as they fly across the room. Still, some of the missions are dull. The first \"act\" (similar to Gears of War) is excellent, then the 2nd one is really boring, and the 3rd one is pretty good, but the 4th one is not much fun. Still, the game\\'s last act is very good, and has a decent ending. I won\\'t say what happens in the 2nd and 4th act because it is quite interesting, but the gameplay is repitive.\\xa0Overall, \"The Darkness\" is an excellent game. I bought this during the summer and I couldn\\'t ask for anything more with a summer game. It really is magnificent. The multiplayer is very mediocre, but the rest of the package is solid. It is extremely violent and sadistic at times, but those elements themselves probably lend toward its excellence.',\n",

       "  'description': \"In 2002 Bethesda softworks released The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. It was a huge imersive RPG experience that unfortunately had some problems that prevented it from worldwide recognition. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblvion fixes all of these problems and could well be named one of the best RPG's of all time.  So not to spoil the main story of the game, this will be brief. The game takes place in a land called Tamriel and in the province of Cyridiil. Accross Cyrodiil Oblivion gates have been popping up everywhere unleashing deadly enemies named Daedra. The story is mainly told and moved along by the characters that you speak to during the game, all of the dialogue is voice acted which is an amazing technical achievement and makes the game ever so more immersive. The story is very lenghty and takes about 20 hours to complete if you don't do any of the games side quests. There are hundreds of side quests that you can undertake to get more items or gain more experience. In Cyrodiil you can join three Guilds, The Mages Guild in which you undertake magic orientated missions. The Fighters Guild allows you to take on battle orientated missions and the Theives Guild lets you learn how to steal. The Guilds missions will also take you about 10 hours to complete each one and that doesnt include the many many quests you pick up from people in the streets.  Oblivion is a first person RPG and although you can change the camera and put it behind you, the first person is always the best. You fight enemies with either a blade, blunt weapon like a mace or a bow. With each of the weapons you fight using the right trigger to swing or fire and the left trigger to either block with the weapon or with a shield. The fighting is very well executed and is never boring since it is up close and in your face. Magic is also very key to the gameplay in which you will use it to heal your self with, fight with and even summon deadly creatures that fight with you. The magic is very well balanced and easy to do. Each of the above skills can be upgraded simply by doing them and theres many more. The games difficulty increases as you gain higher levels, which you do as you increase you major skills. This way the game only gets harder as you get better. When you first sit down to play, everything seems to feel overly complicated. The game doesn't do a very good job at explaining everything, but the manual does it perfect and I highly reccomend looking at all the skills in the manual before you choose them. It also explains other complicated better than the game for example alchemy and magic.  You can either explore Cyrodiil on foot or by horse and even exploring accross the huge land can be extremely fun at times. One of the great new features in Oblivion is now you can fast travel by bringing up your journal and selecting the place you want to go once you have already explored there. The game has frequent load screens but this doesnt hinder the game at all as they are all very short.  The graphics in the game are superb. The interiors are hugely detailed and diverse and the landscapes look amazing. The downside is that when your exploring the countryside it often jutters because of loading textures and details. Although this doesnt really affect the game in any way it could well have been fixed. The hud is great and looks very clear in HD. The weapons and armor are extremely detailed, they all glimmer in the sun and have light reflect off them. The magic effects also look very cool too with great light flashes and fire effects.  The fact that every person in Cyrodiil has a voice is amazing and really makes you feel like your in this living breathing world. The game has an amazing orchestral soundtrack by Jeremy Soule. It may not be as good as the Morrowind soundtrack but it suits the game perfectly.  The main quest will take the average player about 20 hours to complete, after then theres the guild quests which will take about 30 hours to complete. After then there are still other quests that you can undertake from just about anyone in cyridiil. The game is huge and completely open ended. It could well be the best game the xbox 360 will get. Anyone who doesnt have this game is truely missing out on a fantastic videogame experience.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"The PS3 is in desperate need of good games, but help is coming, and has already arrived in the form of the next chapter in the Ratchet and Clank series. There have been two installments since 2004's Up Your Arsenal, but one focused on shooting and multiplayer and the other was on the PSP, so this feels like the first real game in a few years. I'd been looking forward to it, and while it doesn't really take the franchise to new and exciting places, it's still a very satisfying addition. Obviously, the change in system comes with a bump in graphics, and Tools of Destruction is one of the prettiest games there is. Not only is Insomniac incredibly technically efficient with making hardware do what they want, but the visual design is enjoyable and sucks you into the constantly-expanding universe. It can seem a bit too kid-friendly at times, but you can ignore that while you destroy aliens and robots with heavy explosives. There are a few more glitches than we're used to seeing in the series though, like Ratchet not properly staying on terrain that rises and falls, and controls locking up for a few seconds.I was never a huge fan of the online play in the latter PS2 games, but the lack of it in Tools of Destruction could reduce the value if the single-player was too short. Luckily the length was pretty satisfying, as it extended a little past where I expected it to end, and in fact might have been stretching it a bit too much. Some have complained about the difficulty being too easy as well, although I didn't see much to that either. It wasn't frustrating, but it wasn't a cakewalk either, especially if you try to upgrade all the weapons instead of using the best ones over and over. The Ratchet gameplay isn't quite as magical as it used to be. It's still a ton of fun, but we've done this before, so it's really hard to say Tools is as outstanding as previous entries. And there's also the lame tilt controls that get shoe-horned into every PS3 game. You can turn them off, but it disables one of the better weapons against large groups. There's nothing terrible about the uses they've come up with, but they don't add anything to the experience besides occasional annoyance when the alignment messes up. Tools of Destruction has a few small problems that detract from the experience and it's not as original as it used to be, but it's still one of the most purely fun games of this generation.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'An adventure game is a hard thing to pull off. You need to have, above all, a good plot with deeply layered characters, along with clever puzzles and items. Hotel Dusk: Room 215 ticks all the right boxes, although you might encounter a few minor niggles along the way.You play as a former police officer Kyle Hyde, who was let go due to an incident involving his partner, Brian Bradley. At the start of the game you watch a movie showing Hyde sitting in his office and receiving a call about Bradley. Hyde is then on the docks and shoots his beloved friend Bradley, sending his body flying into the river. The body was never discovered, and Hyde has a suspicion that his partner is still alive. Hyde goes to work for a door-to-door sales company, but the boss (his Dad\\'s good friend) uses Hyde as an investigator, unbeknown to most. His current task takes him to Hotel Dusk, a rundown hotel where he must find two items for a client. All the time Hyde is searching for his friend, but at Hotel Dusk, the people there aren\\'t as they might first seem.The game is played by holding the DS sideways, giving the feel that you are actually reading a detective novel. On the touch screen you press and hold where you want to go on a detailed map, and Hyde will start walking to that place. Meanwhile on the other screen, a first person view is displayed of what Hyde would be seeing. If you want to interact with the environment or a person, you simply press the corresponding button on the bottom of the touch screen and you will enter that mode. In the look mode, you will be able to touch things and Hyde will describe the object, or perhaps pick it up. In the talking mode, Hyde will be on the left of the screen and the other person will be shown on the other screen - each of their speech will be displayed at the bottom of their screen. Throughout the game there will be puzzles to solve, such as tapping in a security code or giving mouth to mouth to someone. All of these are completed using clever functions of the DS, such as closing the DS shut or performing an action on the touch screen. These work really well, and it is a good job that the game isn\\'t overcrowded with them, because it\\'s fun when you encounter one. Typical adventure game puzzles also occur, such as having to use a certain object with something else.The bulk of the game is taking up with talking to people and discovering the secrets that lie within their hearts, of which there are many. There is a lot of extremely well written speech for all of the characters, of which there are many different faces and personalities throughout the hotel (Hyde himself is a brilliant character), but some people may get tired of reading it all if they aren\\'t used to the genre. The plot slowly unwraps as you go along, and each character has their own story to tell which will hopefully lead you to your final goal - finding Bradley. As you go along in the game it will keep amazing you how clever and detailed the story is, and just how engrossing it is. You really won\\'t be able to put the game down, just because you want to know what\\'s going to happen next.The difficulty of the game gets progressively harder of the course of the game, but you won\\'t find yourself shouting at your DS to tell it what you have to do next. If you are wandering around for ages not doing anything, Hyde will think something like \"maybe I should go see Dunning\" or \"perhaps I should visit room 217\". There is a minor flaw in picking up objects, in that it sometimes won\\'t let you reach a certain chapter, although this probably helps keep the game challenging.One of the first things you\\'ll notice when playing the game is the wonderful visual style. The characters are all given a hand-drawn look without colour, and certain parts of the character look like they\\'re moving, even when the person is idle. The environments are in full, coloured 3D and they themselves look nice, especially when you get close to an object. It\\'s a weird mix, but it\\'s pulled off extremely well.There is no voice acting in the game, and this itself is a two sided argument. Having voice acting probably wouldn\\'t have been technically possible to fit on the DS cart, but even if it had it would have taken away the imagination of making up your own voices for the characters. On the other hand, due to the sheer amount of text, it may have helped move along the game for some people. The music in the game fits well to that of a detective movie, with jazzy tunes which go perfectly to the situation, such as a shift in mood in a conversation. The music can even be played back to you later in the pub, which is a nice little feature.As with a lot of adventure games, the game is played once and then put on the shelf to collect dust - not Hotel Dusk. The game has six alternative endings, each having their own special requirements to be able to unlock, giving the game real replay value for people who want to know every minor bit of the story. If you\\'re a fan of adventure games, detective and mystery novels or not, you\\'ll still absolutely love this game, unless you have a strong dislike for reading. Hotel Dusk: Room 215 is a stunning game, bursting with clever characters and plot twists. Cing really have a winner on their hands with this game, and a sequel would be welcomed with open arms.',\n",

       "  'description': \"As a pure first-person shooter, Bioshock isn't that great. The variety of weapons isn't bad, and the plasmid and tonic super-powers that give you an edge are fun to play with. There's a lot of enjoyment to be had from sending swarms of bees after your enemies or launching them into the air with a small whirlwind. But the shooting controls are a little off compared to more dedicated games, and it can get tiring fighting the same stupid enemies over and over again. Even Big Daddies, one of the most interesting foes to be introduced to games in a long time, lose their edge after you've spent enough time around them. But while other shooters are good because of the gunplay, Bioshock is good because of everything else.Rapture, the underwater capitalistic utopia that has fallen into chaos, is one of the best realized and most intriguing game settings I've ever seen. Because of something about the design, the game can be a bit mentally taxing to play, but I kept coming back partly because the world is so interesting. It's a hip 1950's society gone wrong, and just surveying all the horrible things that have happened is quite an experience. Scattered everywhere are audio diaries that fill in the ample backstory, while at the same time revealing gameplay hints. A lot of them are cryptic, but if you pay attention you get plenty of information to make the experience more fulfilling. Part of me wishes it was a bit more like Half-Life, introducing you to the world in a normal, peaceful state, and then having it all hit the fan in front of you. But they chose to go a different way and it works well enough. There's a sort of horror vibe with the game, although not much of it is legitimately frightening. It's not like there are failed attempts at scares though, it's just a slightly different tone, being pervasively creepy without going for visceral shocks. There are a few gameplay climaxes with larger scale combat, but in general the pace is a bit stately, with a constant state of semi-tension instead of a repeated rise and fall. This is also reflected in general design, with lots of exploration and encouraged scouring of the environment, with some added RPG elements such as a commerce system and the ability to construct your own supplies. You can also hack the various security systems and supply machines using a minigame that isn't that interesting and doesn't make much sense, but it can provide some fun if you liked Pipe Dream.You can't really talk about Bioshock without talking about the actual story that takes place while you're playing. There's a bit of mystery about who you really are and who's on whose side. There are some stunning twists and revelations that take a while to come about, but add a great deal of satisfaction to the experience. It's very rare for me to really be genuinely surprised by a game story, but they pulled it off. There's one line that will be forever engraved in my memory. The ending depends on a choice you make near the beginning of the game, and the two options are perhaps a bit too simply cut-and-dry for the otherwise very intelligent tale. Still, the plot, both in the content and presentation, is pretty terrific, and a huge reason why Bioshock is one of the best games of the year.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Tons of people in class ask me if this is the next Halo. When I say no, they\\'re dissappointed. Just because it\\'s a First Person Shooter, doesn\\'t mean that it fits in the same class as Halo because BioShock redefines the single-player fun and innovation of the FPS genre and lives up to all its hype. It is set in 1961 in the Atlantic Ocean in which the plane you were in mysteriously crashes. Soon, you come upon the underwater city of Rapture where everyone seems to hate you. The people of Rapture are a little on the crazy side, the reason for that is the over-dosage of plasmids, like steroids except with fire, ice, electricity and minus the tiny marbles. The story is what makes the genius of Bioshock, but so does the awesome gameplay. Plasmids come in different types such as incinerate, electro bolt, winter blast and my personal favorite, telekinesis which allows you to levitate items like barrels, hammers, even dead bodies and then shoot them at your opponents. Most of the weapons are mostly standard (pistol, machine gun, shotgun etc.) but some of them are pretty kick-ass. I don\\'t want to tell you what they are, because I\\'m kind of spoiling already. I\\'ll tell you this though, you can create and use different kinds of ammo for each gun, plus upgrade them at specific stations. The enemies are pretty well balanced, with different classes of the Rapturians called Splicers and the occasional boss. There\\'s about 5 or 6 classes of Splicers, all with their different abilities, strengths and weaknesses. But the scariest of the enemies that you\\'ll be fighting aren\\'t Splicers. The Big Daddy is self explanatory, they\\'re big, smart, and can be the boss of you whenever possible, and I really hope your daddy never beat you, because this will bring back some bad memories. The other kind I think you\\'ve heard what you need to hear about the gameplay.\\xa0Visually, this game is art. I don\\'t care what Roeper says, it\\'s freakin\\' art! The sound is amazing, and the music really sets the creepy mood of the game. The one flaw that everyone likes to point out, however is dieing. You can never die in BioShock, you just get sent to something like a phone booth that gives most of your health back and all your items you had before you \"died.\" It kind of makes the game a little easier than it should be, but if the booths didn\\'t exist, you would be in pain, playing this game. If this game had co-op, it would be a 9.5 for me, but that\\'s still possible to have with the magic of downloadable content. If you\\'re tired of the all-too-similar first person shooters, I highly recommend this game!',\n",

       " {'deck': \"Assassin's Creed\",\n",
       "  'description': \"A spiritual sequel to the Prince of Persia games of the last generation of consoles, Creed has a familiar feel but replaces the linearity with an open world, wall running and time control powers with an awesome free-running system, the fantasy setting with a science fiction one, and the mediocre combat with slightly different mediocre combat. Many have complained about the repetitive mission structure, and they're justified in doing so. There are only about half a dozen types of activities you can do than make up the bulk of the game, leaving the actual assassinating a little too infrequent. But it's not that big of a deal. I wish they could have fleshed out the whole investigating idea, and made it feel more like you were planning a highly delicate operation instead of just repeating some simple tasks before getting to go after your target, but I can't blame them too much when it's so fun just to play around in the world. If you don't like picking pockets and doing all the other assassin's chores, you only have to do some of it. If something's frustrating, you usually can ignore it and still move on with the game. Personally, I did every investigation, rescued every citizen, and climbed every vantage point. The game rewards you for doing so, giving you tips and maps that make the job a little easier and extra means to escape pursuers. I didn't collect all the flags though, because that would be tiresome and completely pointless, as all they unlock is achievements in the 360 version.Other problems people have is with the AI and combat that's all too easy once you learn the counter-kill. I agree that it's pretty ridiculous that you can get away with killing guards right in front of each other if you just pose like a monk while doing it, but once they do start chasing you, I was pretty impressed with how they kept up. Getting away from guards is about as fun a chase as there is in video games. Altair can climb and jump and do anything a human could conceivably do, and it's a unique sort of fun to use your awesome yet believable abilities to evade soldiers who can chase you almost anywhere. It is pretty lame how enemies only attack one at a time, but while it's too easy, I did have fun toying with enemies before dispatching them in a number of satisfying ways. The open space between cities was also a bit of fun to ride around in on a horse, and definitely gave off a Shadow of the Colossus vibe with the look of the environment. It's not really a spoiler to say that this game doesn't take place during the crusades, since it's revealed you're in a simulation during the near future right at the beginning. There are two plot threads, the crusade one which wraps up by game's end, and the future one that does a good job of stringing you along with little bits of information before leaving you hanging for the obvious sequel. It will be interesting to see where they go with that, I imagine it will take place at a different point in history, with perhaps the third game finally being all in the modern day. The voice acting is a bit repetitive, but otherwise the game sounds good, and looks good too. The look is very nice, and technically the world is very impressive, except for some pop up when outdoors and an inconsistent frame rate. What's odd is that it doesn't slow down, but speed up in a couple unique situations. It's not a big deal, just strange. Assassin's Creed isn't the completely amazing game it looked like it could have been from the trailers, but they definitely built a very promising foundation for the future.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Planescape Torment is a traditional computer role-playing game from Black Isle Studios, developers of the highly acclaimed Fallout series. But while the Fallout series contained a post-apocalyptic, futuristic setting, Torment features one of the favorite settings for cRPGs, Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. Despite choosing a setting familiar to most traditional RPG players, the developers do a great job in weaving one of the best stories ever told in a role-playing game that will have you questioning your own actions at every turn and that is what makes Torment a truly outstanding game.  In Torment you play a truly out of the ordinary protagonist. You are not a charismatic hero blessed with the powers of all Gods out to save the Earth; you are “The Nameless One”. You are horribly scarred and not only are you immortal but have also lost all your memories from previous deaths. You awaken in the Mortuary of all places and beginning from there your quest is to find out who you are, who you were and why you cannot die? As these questions begin to play in your mind, you begin to develop an almost personal bonding with The Nameless One and by the end you feel like you are more part of an experience created by yourself than a game created by a developer.  It is not only you, The Nameless One, who is extraordinary but every character in your party is just the same. Your party contains everyone from a talking skull, to a fiend with a bad attitude to a mage burning in flames to a walking armor suit who believes everyone will get their justice. As a result of the game’s great writing, you get to know about each of the characters in your party intimately and begin to care for them unlike most other games where they are passers-by more than anything. The great thing is that your party members will react differently depending on whether you are good or evil and your level of interaction will be varied depending on your moral alignment which really makes you choose your actions with greater care.  The only part of the game where D&D comes of any use is in character creation and combat. You can play either as a Fighter, a Mage or a Thief. Though owing to the main character’s immortality playing as a Fighter is considerably easier than playing as a Mage or a Thief. And at any point in the game, you can switch between these classes easily and it makes perfect sense in the context of the game given the protagonist is an amnesiac. Combat is one of the noticeable flaws in the game, the only saving grace being there is not a lot of it. From playing the game, one can clearly make out combat was not in the developer’s mind from the first point. Since this is a D&D game, all of the attacks are calculated as Dice Rolls, though these take place under the hood and the only indication that you have made contact is a small spot of blood from your enemy’s body and a small text displaying the amount of damage done. Given that the early portions of the game contain very few healing items, most people (especially spellcasters) will want to avoid combat early in the game. All in all, combat could be one major area which many people will complain about in the game.  Comparing Torment’s graphics with the standards set by today’s games like Oblivion would be simply unfair. But considering that the game is almost 9 years old and based on an even older Infinity Engine, Planescape still looks average only. Some of the spell effects like Cone of Cold, Fire and Ice and many others still look dazzling considering the game’s age and there are some other neat effects like when you see a huge Abhishai in front of you, it will look like it towers above you. Overall, the game’s graphics does its job quite well but you wouldn’t even care about the graphics even if you feel it is average as you will be engrossed by the game’s awesome story.  Considering the fact that most role-playing games have great sound, Torment can be considered a disappointment. Some of the sound tracks in the game are awesome but there are very few of them so by the end of the game you will hear some of the same tracks looping again and again and this can really put off some people. Some of the sound in the combat sections of the game is very nice and it does well to set the mood for some of the bigger battles in the game and other neat little effects like when you are inside some house or an underground tunnel you would hear the voices lower than ordinary and also hear it echo inside the place are very good. The voice acting in the game is very well done, the only irritating fact being it is few and far between. But when you do hear the characters speak their voices and it happens only during some of the important dialogue in the game it is very good.  The game's interface is rather well designed than most other isometric RPGs. The onscreen action is much closer to your perspective than other isometric games like Baldur's Gate. The interface is not the best but is easy to get used to. Every time you want to choose a special item, spell or weapon, you right click anywhere on the screen to bring up a smaller menu from where you can perform your actions easily. The bad thing about this interface being it opens up right in the middle of the screen covering your characters but the good thing is that the game is automatically paused when you bring up this interface. Overall, you will definitely get used to this interface easily especially if you have played other Infinity based RPGs like Baldur's Gate 1 and 2.  Notwithstanding the game’s graphics and sound, the best part of Torment is actually in its written dialogue and there is a whole lot of it. The best part of the writing is that it never gets boring or tiring to read because of its incredible quality. Some subtle dialogues in the game do a greater job in setting the mood than onscreen action ever would have. For example, you would be in a dark alley and suddenly one of your party members will say “What a stinking place to be in!” and this also helps in character development as you would grow to care about your party members because of it. The developers officially claim there are more than 1 million words in the game and I can safely say that you would not even see all of it in the first play through since most of the dialogue options only open up depending on your stats. The dialogues play an important role in your alignment and because you can be good or evil or shades in-between, you will want to choose your words carefully. Since you see many characters in the game and read lots of dialogues, you would find yourself going back to think what little dialogues earlier in the game actually meant in the wider context of the game’s story and it is kudos to Chris Avellone and his team for integrating the dialogues this tightly to the role-playing aspect of the game rather than relying on combat and action for developing the story.  In spite of having this many likable qualities and one of the best stories in an RPG, Torment didn’t break any sales records and that is primarily due to the fact that there are many minor things which one could nitpick about in the game. There are many bugs in the game which slows the game to a crawl and makes the game nearly unplayable during some of the important sections in the game. Many quests could never be finished because of bugs and though many patches were released they never fixed all of the game’s problems and this was the main reason for the game’s quite ordinary sales. Other things you can complain about are the game’s quite average sound and the fact that only some of the dialogues were actually voiced but these minor problems in no way reduce the quality of what is a great game by all accounts.  Planescape Torment features an amazing cast of characters right from the protagonist to the people surrounding him, an awesome storyline, nice combat and above all a highly replayable campaign to boot. The first time play through will take you about 20-25 hours to finish give or take the number of side-quests you choose and since there are alternate endings and whole different paths which you can choose depending on whether you want to be good or evil, the game offers further incentive to go back at least a second time if not more. Though, there is no way to stop after you have finished the game twice or even thrice as you will eventually get addicted to The Nameless One’s adventure and never stop playing it. Torment is one of those rare gems that comes once in a while to surprise everyone with its originality and that is the main reason anyone who has not yet played this amazing title should get down to it right now. Take my word for it, it is just that good. Go find yourself a copy of this game and see what you’ve missed for the past 9 years.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Yeah, the first game. In the past I've played and enjoyed bits of the campaign and some multi-player, but I'd never sat down and played it through. I worked through it on a friend's Xbox, and I'm glad I did. I think the series' fans are a little overboard, it's really not that much better than a lot of console shooters. But it's really quite revolutionary and commendable for what it does right. Before Halo, every FPS had a large, unruly inventory of weaponry and a health bar. After Halo, almost all of them limit you to a couple weapons at a time and feature a regenerating health system. Some games are better with the old ways, but it's definitely a good system that changes the way things are played. Instead of getting attached to the best weapon, good players will constantly switch out their armament for whatever's appropriate to the situation and make good use of cover and thinking tactically instead of just rushing into battle, knowing that's not how you're supposed to play. It's facilitated strategy in its players more than any other shooter. The Combat Evolved tagline isn't just a catchy phrase, it's really what the game's about. And you can tell, as the shooting itself is greatly balanced while a lot of the rest of the design is flawed.I've heard stories before about Halo's level design being really repetitive and boring, and that's mostly true. It actually wasn't as bad as I expected it to be, even the infamous library didn't take too long to slog through. But if the best I can say about the environment is it's not as bad as I expected, that's still a problem. I realize that carbon-copy architecture and revisiting the same areas are well justified by the background and plot of the story, but that doesn't excuse those flaws. Maybe they should have written it a bit differently. The story itself is actually pretty good, at least for a shooter. The atmosphere doesn't approach Bioshock's or Half-Life's, but the actual machinations and characters are pretty interesting. Master Chief's a good protagonist (although I don't see why anyone cares what's under that helmet) and 343 Guilty Spark's a good take on the HAL 9000-type of villain. I always appreciate it when a game or something manages to have foes who aren't all allied with each other, and they actually manage to balance three different factions who fight each other and only have a hit out for the Chief in common. I'll be tackling Halo 2 next, and I look forward to seeing the next leg of the adventure.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Resident Evil 4 Wii edition is the definitive version of Resident Evil 4. The original game came out on the Game Cube in early 2005. Back then the game was an instant classic gaining a huge reputation. The game was released again later that year on the PS2 with some extra missions bundled in. Again the game gained huge critical acclaim. Earlier this year the PC version was released with more extra missions and now we hit the Wii edition. The Wii edition is essentially all of these games bundled into your Wii with an exciting new control scheme.  The game takes place in 2004 six years after the events of Resident Evil 2 and 3. You play Leon Kennedy, a survivor from from Resi 2 who's an American agent looking for the presidents kidnapped daughter. You start the game in the middle of some woods in Eastern Europe searching for her. You search soon leads away from these places as you make your way to castles, labs and other horrific locations. The graphics are generally really good for a Wii game but you don't tend to really care, by the time you play the first 5 minutes your engrossed.  The gameplay in Resi 4 Wii edition is what really makes it stand out. This is largely due to the awesome control system. You move Leon with the right stick on the nunchuck, then when you want to aim you hold B aim at the screen with the remote and fire with A. There are a couple other neat control tricks to learn along the way but I won't spoil them. The remote gives you pin point accuracy against your foes, it may be slightly less precise than the king mouse and keyboard but it will make you never want to pick up a dual analogue again. Everything about the controls just feels right and you begin to think why don't all games control this good?  Resident Evil 4 is one intense game. Because you can't move when your aiming you become very afraid as enemies lurk towards brandishing all sorts of deadly weapons. The shooting never seems to become repetitive because the controls are so intuitive. It does sometimes feel more like a shooter than a survival horror game but as you progress the horror builds. Most cutscenes in the game require you to press button combinations to do certain movements otherwise you lose health etc. This is very clever as it doesn't only keep the cutscenes intense but also requires you to pay attention to the great story. They wouldn't make you watch the cutscenes if the story wasn't good, and it is, very.  A huge part of the game and it's story are the bosses. The game features around 10 boss fights, most of which made me swear. They look so cool and so scary at the same time. The best part is that each of them are a joy to fight, thankfully they aren't as frustrating other Resident Evil games. They keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time and just working out how in hell your supposed to kill them is great fun, which is rare for a boss fight. The game is also slightly on the hard side but once you get through it, it's very satisfying.  Resident Evil 4 may have a new control scheme compared to the old games but it still manages to keep it's horror moments. Numerous times I have cursed loudly at my TV when people leap out of places you don't expect them to or you see a very deadly foe coming for you. These moments aren't very often but when they come around they are awesome.  The main story lasts about 14 - 18 hours depending on how good you are or how much you want to look around for cool stuff. The game features a very cool upgrade system for your weapons which gives the game a huge amount of depth and replay value as certain scenarios are affected by which weapon your using and how good it is. Resi 4 features an assortment of cool weapons which when fully upgraded are so deadly. Beyond the main game there are also extra missions and bonus games to play after you complete the game for the first time. I won't lay them all out as they could potentially ruin the story but they will give you another 6 - 10 hours of gameplay.  Overall Resident Evil 4 Wii edition is one of the best games on the Wii at the moment. If your into your shooters, story driven or horror games pick this up as you will not be disappointed. The game controls great, it keeps you on your edge and concludes with a great ending leaving you eager for some Resident Evil 5.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'I went to college with a girl named Gina Tiranelli. I never really knew her until senior year, but she showed up in a lot of my Psychology classes all of the sudden. Through random chance, she and I wound up working together quite a bit. She was, hands down, the hottest woman I\\'d ever met, and is still in my personal top five. Viewtiful Joe 2 reminds me a lot of Gina Tiranelli.  At first glance, you can\\'t get over how exotic and beautiful Viewtiful Joe 2 looks. The designers at Clover Studio took the idea of cel-shading beyond merely replicating a comic book. They created a look that\\'s hard to describe, but is undeniably beautiful, reminding me of Gina\\'s olive skin and piercing eyes.\\xa0 Try to imagine an anime that takes chop sockey martial arts flicks, schlock science-fiction, and \"Land of the Lost\" and puts it all in a blender, and you\\'ll have a good idea of how Viewtiful Joe 2 looks. It\\'s full of vibrant colors, crazy backgrounds, unique and often weird enemies, all of which are animated gorgeously.  Then, you get to know how Viewtiful Joe 2 works, and it\\'s pretty cool. Just like how Gina was into sports and played a wicked game of pool, Viewtiful Joe 2 has some fun and exciting new ideas thrown into what is, at its core, a side-scrolling beat \\'em up. You can\\'t block; you have to time and evade your opponent\\'s telegraphed moves or you will get hit. But, if you successfully sidestep their strikes, you can counterattack the baddies into tomorrow with a bunch of flashy punches and kicks. Once you acquire your \"VFX\" powers, your attacks become even more outrageous and powerful. The VFX moves include a \"bullet-time\" inspired slowdown mode, which causes everything to move as slow as molasses, a mach speed mode that causes your attacks to speed up to the point where you set yourself on fire, a replay attack that hits the enemies three times, and a zoom in mode that gives you center stage to put on a brutal display of punches and kicks. If you activate multiple VFX powers at the same time, you become practically unstoppable. Additionally, VJ2 add\\'s Joe\\'s girlfriend Silvia as a playable character to kick even more butt.\\xa0 At the touch of a button, you\\'ll swap in Silvia, giving you access to her twin pistols and slightly different attacks. Collectively, these features give you a lot of options to defeat any foe that stands in your way, and are a fresh take on a stale genre.  But then, after spending more time with the game, you find out that it, just like Gina, doesn\\'t have much more depth to it.\\xa0 Right when you\\'ve gotten to understand how the game works, it stops trying.\\xa0 Gina really liked to have movie nights where we\\'d watch a *shudder*  romantic comedy, testing my patience.\\xa0 Similarly, you get your last power very early in the third level of Viewtiful Joe 2.\\xa0 From then on, you\\'re just slogging through the same enemies, using the same techniques over and over again, until getting completely bored with the utter monotony of Viewtiful Joe 2\\'s design.\\xa0 How many times can you watch Meg Ryan mug for the camera?\\xa0 About as many times as you can slow-mo punch a grunt.  The shallow script doesn\\'t really help matters, either.\\xa0 While Viewtiful Joe 2\\'s sound effects are great, the voice acting gets on your nerves very quickly.\\xa0 It\\'s not that the delivery is poor; it\\'s just that the lines are stupid, and some of the voices sound like nails on a chalkboard.\\xa0 Both problems actually fit with the overall tone of the game - after all Joe is supposed to be starring in dumb B-level action flicks. But the plot is utter nonsense, and the characters actually exclaim catchphrases like, \"Henshin-a-go-go, baby!\" a few dozen times per level. Like with Gina, you\\'ll tune out what Viewtiful Joe 2 says after a few minutes (\"Uh huh, new high heels. They\\'re red? That\\'s cool.\")\\xa0 Unlike with Gina, though, you can thankfully skip most of the dialogue with the press of a button.  Even though you\\'ll quickly become bored by this game, you\\'ll probably still find yourself going through the motions to see if there\\'s going to be a payoff.\\xa0 Unfortunately, neither Viewtiful Joe 2 nor Gina makes it easy. Like a set of proverbial hoops to jump through, Viewtiful Joe 2 throws a myriad of infuriating puzzles at you. The solutions aren\\'t difficult or challenging. They\\'re down-right nonsensical and will likely require more than one visit to gamefaqs.com to figure out. You\\'ll have to use a combination of different VFX powers in different ways, sometimes illogically, just to fail the puzzle and have to start it all over again. Once you get past them, and think you can finally close the deal, you\\'re thrown up against extremely powerful bosses that have far too much health, and deal too much damage to beat without dying over and over again. The whole experience quickly becomes frustrating. Eventually, you realize that the payoff will never be worth the time that you put in, as Viewtiful Joe 2 never gets any better. You won\\'t waste a lot of time with this game, probably around 12-15 hours.

       "  'description': \"Halo 2 is basically a repeat of the first game; a fun, solid, but probably a little overrated shooter, which fixes some of the original's problems but has some of its own. It seems like there's a step backward for every step forward. You now have the ability to dual wield certain weapons, but doing so prevents you from using melee attacks without dropping the second gun or grenades or grenades at all, limiting your diversity in combat. Dual wielding allows for some interesting new strategies and combinations, but overall most of the weapons are less effective that they were before. I liked messing up dudes with the energy sword, but I'm a little annoyed by the Covenant's insistence on their own technological superiority when all of their gear manages to both have finite ammo AND overheat rather quickly. The only thing that seems advanced about it is its impressive curvy and purple design. You can also play around with more vehicles, which are usually pretty fun, although those sections tend to be a little easy.My biggest complaint about the first game was the tedious, repetitive level design, and they made good strides forward correcting that, with some interesting structures and well-put together set pieces. It tended to limit the scope of some levels, and especially later on it feels a bit like a boring old corridor shooter instead of having the interesting depth of a large, wide-open war zone, and they couldn't seem to help repeating the same level pieces over and over once you get deeper into the new Halo installation, but I thought they did a decent job overall. They elaborate much more on the story, showing things from the Covenant's point of view, and you actually spend a significant amount of time playing as one of them instead of the Chief, though there isn't much difference in gameplay besides the interesting cloaking ability and increased difficulty in discerning friend from foe. Most people hated the cliffhanger ending, and I can definitely see why, as it seems like they're setting up the last mission instead of the sequel, but I knew that was coming so I wasn't bothered. A huge part of Halo's love comes from the multiplayer. I've spent some time with it in the past, and it's enjoyable, I just never like playing deathmatches as much as other people do. Halo's not as fresh as its prequel was for the genre but it's still a good entry in it.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Day of the Tentacle is a timeless classic thanks to its clever writing and its inventive setting. The story concerns a genetic experiment known as Purple Tentacle, who drinks some toxic water despite the protest of fellow genetic mutation Green Tentacle. Purple immediately grows arms and resolves to turn on his creator, Dr. Fred, and all of humanity. You play as three characters, Bernard, Laverne and Hoagie who are quickly trapped in various time periods by Dr. Fred's malfunctioning time machine. Having three playable characters in three different time periods allows the puzzles to be extremely inventive and intriguing as they require you to think fourth dimensionally, as it were. The voice acting in the game is all really excellent, and it has a fair amount of speech considering this game was released fifteen years ago. Though the game isn't especially long once you know the solutions to all the puzzles, its still enjoyable to replay it every now and then just to experience the story and revisit the often funny characters and situations. As such, it is definitely a classic worth picking up as it is a fine example of a nearly lost form of gaming and it has aged extremely well. \",\n",

       " {'deck': \"Uncharted: Drake's Fortune\",\n",
       "  'description': \"Uncharted is a great showcase of what the PS3 hardware can do and the beginning of a potentially great franchise. As is common with Naughty Dog's games, the difficulty can be a bit uneven, but it's still a really fun game. There are two main aspects to Uncharted's gameplay, the shooting and the platforming. The shooting plays a lot like Gears of War, with the perspective over the shoulder while aiming and a very similar cover system. You're a little more helpless though, being a basically normal guy instead of an armored space marine, and you can only carry a few clips worth of ammo for whatever weapons you happen to be carrying. Most fights are pretty manageable, but a few are a little too tough - enemies are pretty good about using cover and surrounding you, and sometimes things seem a little stacked in their favor. You're rarely at a loss though, because the controls are nice and fluid. The aiming works well, and you can usually maneuver pretty well, although once in a while you'll stick to a wall you didn't want to instead of rolling. The platforming is like the recent Prince of Persia or Tomb Raider games, and it's nicely responsive and fun, although Nate seems a little too nimble climbing walls and those sections rarely provide much challenge. The infrequent puzzles are the same way - the focus testers must have been pretty clueless if the developers thought they had to basically spell out all the solutions in Drake's diary.While there are a few missteps in the game, it's biggest strong point is probably presentation, in all aspects. The graphics are pretty amazing. The environments range from dense jungle to dank caverns to ruins of man-made structures, and all are very impressively rendered and interesting to look at. The characters all look great and animate pretty well. Once in a while something Nate does will look pretty janky, but in general his smoothness between animations is commendable. The music is a great, unique orchestral score, everything sounds the way it should, and voice acting is consistently good. They're usually part of the expertly handled cut scenes that make the rather standard video game story play out in an entertaining way. It feels like an old pulp adventure, and it's as close as I've seen a game come to being as believably presented as a movie. Everything wraps up in a satisfying way while leaving enough of a hint to assure fans that a sequel is on the horizon.\",\n",

       " {'deck': \"Holy Crap! 4X Sci-Fi Gameplay at it's best?!\",\n",
       "  'description': 'The latest foray into the space-based genre of RTS games takes its form in Sins of a Solar Empire, the first and rather highly anticipated title from Ironclad Games. On the surface, Sins appears to be no more than a Homeworld or Hegemonia clone, but a closer inspection of the title unveils a simplified yet altogether brilliantly constructed 4X game. For those not familiar with the term 4X stands for eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate, describing games along the lines of the Civilization and Master of Orion franchises, which incorporate the four mechanics into solid gameplay. Sins incorporates these traits in a streamlined way, finding a graceful balance between the complexity of Master of Orion and the oversimplification of Hegemonia. The story of Sins is simply a prologue for the game, providing a relatively tiny amount of back-story for each of the three factions that players are able to partake in. I use the word prologue here pretty much because that’s essentially all it is, as Sins features no single player campaign. At all. While this might be off-putting to some (and was to me initially), the gameplay of Sins isn’t one in which a single player story would be easy (or even efficient) to tell. The flow of the game is such that any serious attempt at storytelling would be limited to the speed at which the player could effectively expand through each level, and considering how a simple skirmish game against a single CPU opponent can easily take six hours or more, the potential for telling a story isn’t great. As it is, the player is provided with the option of playing as one of three races against the computer or other human players. The TEC (Trade Emergency Coaltion) is an interstellar alliance of human colony worlds. Their ships tend to be heavily armored and focus greatly on ballistic weaponry, and look very similar to the warships of the human Imperium from Warhammer 40,000. The Advent are a crusading human army of exiled religious zealots, returning to TEC space to wage war on their oppressors. Their technology is extremely advanced, producing cheap ships with weak armor that flaunt powerful laser and plasma weapons. Finally, the Vasari are an alien race of conquering nomads, whom have been fleeing a pursuing, unknown force of devastating power for decades. Vasari ships tend to be more expensive but are also heavily armored and fire phase missile technology which has a chance of ignoring enemy shields altogether. ach new game of Sins sees the players (up to 10 of them on included large maps) start with a single controlled planet, from which the player must quickly expand from to increase available resources. After establishing themselves in their home system by building extraction structures to collect crystal and metal from orbiting asteroids, the player will soon need to send out small contingents of frigates and colony ships in a Sci-Fi “land-grab” to quickly establish themselves on neighboring planets and asteroids. There are four types of colonizable planets: desert, terran (Earth-like), ice, and volcanic. Each presents their own challenges to tame, and may not even by colonizable at all without specific research. There are also colonizable asteroid settlements, which cannot support a large population but are useful as outposts. Each asteroid and planet is situated as a node in a vast network of connected “space-lanes” which a player’s units must travel along to traverse the map. The game is driven by the necessity to collect massive amounts of the three resources the economy of Sins is based upon: Crystal, Metal, and Credits. Crystal and Metal can be extracted from small asteroids found throughout the map. Credits can be attained two ways: By having a large established population on colony worlds and asteroids, which taxes their populations, and by building trade stations, which are orbiting ports which send and receive interplanetary (and interstellar) trading craft throughout the map. As a result, most of the game’s important structures and units (specifically capital ships) require a large amount of all three resources before the player can build them. This is definitely a good thing, as the capital ships are powerful in the extreme when compared to standard frigates, and the last thing this game needs is a cap-rush in the beginning of the match. Also of note is the game’s incredible number of technologies and abilities that are available to research. Each race has 6 individual research trees that are eventually fully explored, covering weapons and ship technologies, social and planetary development, defense technology and more. Diplomacy also plays a part in Sins, as even your most hated opponent can become your friends relatively quickly. CPU players will often issue human players various missions, the completion of which will raise the player’s standing with the CPU, allowing for cease fires, trading alliances, shared vision, and more. These missions can range from destroying the ships or structures of another opponent to simple extortion by demanding a donation of a certain amount of resources. What the relationships with the CPU ultimately culminate in, however, is a protection racket. If you want to remain the CPU’s friend, you better damn well do as they ask or risk falling into disfavor, thus becoming their enemy once again. If diplomacy fails, there’s always a less scrupulous option: pirates! Every map of the game has at least one Pirate base, which is home to a massive fleet of terrible ships. Pirates are a third party, controlled by neither a player nor the CPU opponents, and they can be set upon your enemies like dogs of war, given the right price. Every ten minutes or so a pirate raid commences, and a bidding war begins, with players dropping cash on their opponents, enticing the pirate forces to raid a random asteroid or planet of the player who’s had the most cash placed on their bounty. Additionally, the more money placed on a bounty, the larger the pirate attack will be, and even if you lose the bid, the money you spend on a bounty is not refundable. While an interesting mechanic, unfortunately it comes down to each player having to babysit the bidding process every time, which detracts from the game’s flow and keeps the players from focusing on more important things that require their attention. If the game has one major flaw, it would be the sheer amount of time it takes to play most games. There is no such thing as a “quick” match of Sins, as even the smaller maps against a single CPU opponent can take hours. Larger games involving multiple players are simply impossible to resolve in a single sitting, requiring the saving and loading of the game whenever all the same people can come together for another 10 hour stretch. Many people had serious issues with Supreme Commander due to the amount of time a match takes, and those same people should stay well away from Sins of a Solar Empire. It takes, above all else, patience. So, basically what we have here is one of the best 4X RTS games released in years. It has a robust economy, several very interesting mechanics to keep it interesting, beautiful graphics and an aptly epic musical score. The gameplay is fun if you have the patience for drawn out conflict, and the combat truly enters the epic stage later in the game, when there are hundreds of ships engaged in battle. The lack of a single player campaign and the many hours it takes to get anything meaningful out of it hold it back a bit, but if you’re looking for a new RTS experience, look no further than Sins of a Solar Empire.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Gears of War takes place on the planet Sera where this Alien race started to break through the planets crust and kill everything in their path. The COG is the human\\'s race last hope and they have to rely on an inmate to defeat the Locaust.Yeah, yeah I know that story has been done to death so many freaking times I\\'ve almost stopped caring about the story in my Sci-Fi shooters. The sad thing is what I just described above is about as deep as Gears of War\\'s story gets and the campagin feels more like fragment of something great. The campagin will take you roughly five to six hours to complete spanning five acts. All of which are fun to play except the driving sequence which is the worse driving segment in a game I\\'ve ever played. Luckily for Gears of War the gameplay here is simply amazing. You take cover by pressing the \"A\" button and thats pretty much the only button you use for cover. From their you can S.W.A.T. turn, roll out of cover, advance out of cover, or jump over your cover by move the thumbstick left, right, or up and pressing \"A\". You can also dodge, and roll by pressing \"A\" and sprint by holding the \"A\" button down. The down side to this is sometimes you will want to do one thing but your character will do another which is very frustrating in the Single-Player and Multi-Player when people are shooting at you. Along with cover you also have a varaity of weapons to kill your oppent with. One of which (the Lancer) has a chainsaw for a bayonet which is very satisfying. Now as you kill the Locaust blood will spew out their body and the chainsway will desmember their bloody bodies onto the floor in a pile of blood. Yes this game is very gory, but this can be turned off in the Game Options menu, to make the gore more like Halo where its just blood, no extreme blood or dismemberment. You also have a squad to order in the game but it isn\\'t fleshed out as you may think. You can tell your retarted squad members to Regroup, Attack, or Cease Fire. None of which they seem to listen too and your squad mates are simply stupid meat bags that couldn\\'t kill a Locuast if their life depended on it. Luckily their is Co-Op and it seems that this game was built arround Co-Op if you play this game with a friend, your exprence is going to be far greater than if you played it by your self.For the Mutiplayer part of the game you can go online in either a Ranked or Player match. Unfortunately matchmaking is nowehere to be found so players who have an hour of experence will end up against players who have been playing sense the Gears of War launch date. And much like Halo 2, there are numerous exploits that have yet to be fixed along with some weapon ballance issues. I recomend that you stick with Ranked matches unless your playing with your friends becuase lets face it in Gears of War online your a noob what ever you do, and in Player matches the majority of the hosts are d-bags that will kick you from the game for simply killing them. Online everyone just shotgun rushes each other most of the time to get the power weapons which are really over-powered. Take the Longshot for example. If you active reload it, and shoot someone with it, its an instant down no matter where you shot them. Now melee with the weapon and you instantly down down a person.Finding matches is also a pain in the arse as it uses a Server Browser so you won\\'t get to play ever map and will ussually play the most popular maps over and over again. And every time you fail to connect to a host, the browser takes a minute to refresh itself. And people quite matches in this game like now other which hampers the experence when it becomes 4 v 1 online in a Ranked match.On the sound and graphics side of things this game is excelent with very few flaws to see other than it sometimes takes a bit for the game to load its amazing details.All in all Gears of War can be a lot of fun in the Single-Player or cooperatively. You can sometimes find good people to play with online but the community has become so bad that it will hamper an otherwise fun game online. Gears of War deffinately not as good as some people make it out to be but that doesn\\'t stop it from bing an overall blast to play and thats what games are about, fun. ',\n",

The gameplay is a little tweaked and improved, but it isn't any leap forward there that makes it easily my favorite in the series, it's all about the presentation. Previous games were more or less historically based since they took place during World War II, so there was little room for them to surprise you in any meaningful way. But this one has its own storyline, one that manages to be more interesting and emotionally affecting than I've ever expected a war shooter to be. There are plot twists and tense cinematic moments, including a sequence at the end of the first act that left me feeling completely drained and in awe. They do a lot more to mix up your objectives, and while there's still plenty of the same sort of huge battles the series is known for, there are also some very fun quieter moments, like playing as a sniper on a covert mission in a flashback level.Part of why it was so successful is it looks and sounds so good. I'm not obsessed with graphics, but I disagree with anyone who says they're not important. I can enjoy a game with bad graphics just fine if it's fun, but if it looks amazing, there's simply more they can do with it. The parts of Call of Duty 4 I love best simply couldn't be pulled off in the first game's engine. You still see some tired video game stuff like glowing outlines of where to place your explosives, but in general it's an extremely immersive and fun shooter. The gunplay isn't really much better than the field's, but it feels solid and works just fine. Your abilities are a little expanded, with a nice knife melee attack, quick access to multiple grenade types, and even the use of air support in some levels. I haven't played too much multiplayer, but it seems pretty cool, and I like the idea of leveling up as you keep playing. It's a little disappointing to learn that Treyarch is taking the fifth game back to World War II, but we'll see how that turns out.\",\n",

Sybil is being chased by a giant red triangle and Sam & Max need to stop it. Once halted, the introductory credits will roll (with a few slight changes from the titles last episode) and you'll be taken to Easter Island.On Easter Island you find that Sybil is indeed fine, and she has decided to have a picnic with Abe - however, Abe has other things on his mind. You will discover that the Moai heads that inhabitant the island can speak, and they will tell you that it is up to Sam & Max to stop the volcano from erupting and destroying everyone and everything on Easter Island.The backtracking in this episode is generally low, and won't have you constantly trawling back and forth from all the locations for every puzzle. The street layout from Ice Station Santa has been retained, even down to the robot, which is slightly disappointing. Even though Jimmy has set up a business there, you can't do anything there except have short conversations that don't help advance the game in anyway.Despite that, in all other usual locations (such as the office and Stinky's), a few items have been added to help keep things fresh, such as the addition of the North Pole in the office. New dialogue has also been recorded for all the items, which is a good factor that Telltale have retained from the last half of season one.This game isn't going to last you as long as its predecessor, and will probably give you three and a half hours tops, even if you stop to listen and see everything there is. In saying this, the pros of the episode out way this and the length of the episode will not get in the way of your enjoyment.The difficulty in the game is spot on, and if you think hard enough you'll be able to figure a puzzle out, rather than thinking that the solution was pretty stupid. If you do struggle, there is the hint system which will enable Max to pipe up with some clues on what to do next.You might be getting tired of hearing about it, but it is just so good that it needs to be highlighted every single time - the voice acting. This episode probably had the best out of every single episode, first and second season included. A real highlight was when Sam & Max are doing their 'cute' voices to intimidate a baby. The new characters are also well cast, such as the sea chimps. Still remains though is the lower-than-other-games size of the sound files, giving off hissing on the 's' sounds.The graphics are well done, both artistically and graphically, especially Easter Island. The lush landscape looks really nice, and the tropical image is helped by the marvellous music that is truly pleasing on the ears - however, the music is tremendous in every other location too.Despite the minor problems of the length, Telltale have once again produced a transcendent game that'll have you going back over again and again just to make sure you haven't missed any of the witty dialogue. Although this was a great episode, is the best still to come?\",\n",

The game even opens itself up more when you play all the crazy game modes with a friend or bots. the weapons on the game range from revolvers to heatseeking rockets. they is a lot to choose from all from different time zones.The game lets YOU the player choose the game. You can choose which bots to play against create your own unquie weapon sets and more, yu can even create your own map to play on. overall this game is great fun with great graphics, gameplay, sound and replayability and should not be missed. fans of previous timesplitter games won't be disappointed and if you like any first person shooters try this one out! \",\n",

       "  'description': \"Halo: still pretty good. The third installment continues the series tradition of good shooting, incremental gameplay improvements, and an interesting story for a shooter. Unfortunately, it also keeps alive some of its faults, like some repetitive tasks and environments, minor steps backward in some areas and the continued inclusion of the highly uninteresting Flood. I get the desire to mix things up so you're not fighting Covenant the whole time, but seriously, the Flood is boring. I like the story aspect of the Elites changing sides, but unfortunately that takes away the most interesting opponent in the series. Brutes are tough but not as smart, making combat a little less strategic in some cases. Having the Arbiter around most of the time is cool though, it's nice to have an ally who's actually worth something. I didn't like how you're arbitrarily limited to two grenades of each type now. Yeah, now there are four types so you still have a max of eight, but when you don't find the last kind until late in the game, you're left holding six most of the time and wondering why you can't fit a couple more normal ones in the same suit.In general though, Halo is still a really good time. They expanded the vehicle sections, adding multiple new types to play around with. Some of the best fun in the series comes from cruising around, pursuing enemies on large battlefields with explosions happening everywhere. There are new and returning weapons also, and I think they struck a pretty good balance. The game's a little short, but that's okay, I prefer that to pointlessly padding out levels with infinitely copy-pasted corridors. I mentioned repetition, but that's mostly held in check except for the aforementioned Flood and the gigantic walking fortresses known as Scarabs - you encounter them a little too often, although taking one down is pretty cool. Graphically, it's not as flashy as some other current generation games, but it looks nice. There are some really great looking lighting effects, at least. The music is as interesting as ever, and voice acting is decent, although I never like changing voice actors between sequels (is Julie Benz too famous now thanks to Dexter?) and some of the dialogue tries to be cool but is just a little silly. The story is suitably epic and really pretty detailed if you get down into it, and they do a nice job of concluding the trilogy, although I wish there was a real end instead of an obvious sequel hint. Guys, you can make a new story without leaving ends untied. Multiplayer is pretty cool, although I don't really care about online play that much. I don't love Halo, but it's a very solid, entertaining series.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Night of the Raving Dead starts of differently than other episodes, and actually has Sam & Max about to be squashed by a soul-crushing machine. Max asks Sam how they got into this mess, and then the credits roll and you start from the beginning of the story. It's a neat touch, and it's really cool when you get to the bit you saw at the start, and it all clicks together.The plot, without spoiling the clever twist, is that zombies have invaded the town, and it's up to Sam & Max to go to the 'zombie factory' to try and find out what is going on and hopefully stop it. You can't get there straight away however, and you have to walk around and question people about what they know.Some changes have been made to the street outside the office, such as Bosco's now being shut (he doesn't feature in this episode at all, which will no doubt be explained in 204). Sadly, the robot is still there, and once again you cannot interact with what the rats have got set up. You won't really be spending much time in the street anyway, but more time travelling back and forth to different places in your Desoto - take this as you will.The game is challenging, and features some of the best puzzles that have been in the episodes so far. They'll have you scratching your head, but not in the way which will have you clicking every inventory object with everything you can in sheer annoyance. The hint system is also going well and strong, but you'll still feel much more whole if you complete the episode without any help.Graphically the game is still running of the same engine, but a couple of new animations have been added (such as a fan favourite of Sam putting his hands in his pockets). The outside of the castle is superb, and has rain pouring down and lighting flashing in the sky and reflecting off the location below.The music is, as always, a stroke of brilliance from the talented Jared Emerson-Johnson. One of the best pieces of music in the game has to be in Jurgen's castle's secret room, where a stunning violin piece is played out, which perfectly complements the setting, such as the open ceiling onto the rainy night sky, and the overall horror theme of the game.The humour of the game has become much darker than before, and can b described as 'grittier' and much more like the old comics, but this is for the best. The clever innuendos in the game are hilarious, which makes the game feel much more mature, without becoming stupid for the sake of a joke.The massive blow to this episode is the locations that have been lazily recycled. In one part of the game, you have to go back to the set of Midtown Cowboys to film another episode. The set is nearly unchanged from its Situation: Comedy counterpart, which is a total letdown. Sybil's is also back open, but that has only a few new additions, such as some gifts on the floor - a complete overhaul would have been much more welcome, especially since its likely we'll be seeing Sybil's shop again soon. It is a shame on Telltale's side, and it brings the game down because of it.Another problem is that a lot of characters from season one are making their return, something which isn't met with much particular enthusiasm. Among the returns are Mr. Featherly, Superball (although he has quite an amusing door guarding role) and Harry Moleman. It would have been much more fresh and unique if new characters had been made specifically for the role, rather than add to all the recycled material.Apart from these two (slightly big, granted) issues the game retains the excellence of other episodes, if not more so. This is the best episode of season two thus far, but, as usual, the build-up this season suggests that something much more epic is just down the road for Sam & Max...\",\n",

       "  'description': \"So I'm a big PC gamer. I'll try anything on a PC just to see how it goes try out the new graphic cards and see what the new machine can handle and all of that. The one game that got me into PC gaming the most was Civilization. Not anything you would write home about graphics wise or even something that would really take a toll on your CPU but it is what I think PC gaming is really all about. That single player sit at your computer and become the ruler of the world in the comfort of your own room. I loved the game instantly and I have played just about every version of the game since. Now to me Civilization is a PC game and I was very interested to see how they would take this series to the console (I know there was a console version of Civ 2 but we don't like to talk about that).\\xa0 On their latest attempt to bring this PC juggernaut to the console Firaxis and 2K games have done an amazing job of scaling down the Civilization experience into a fun fast pace game more suited for the console. They have managed to tone down the micro-managing portion of the game while still maintaining the sheer thrill of ruling the world in style. The Civ 4 graphics engine has gotten a bit of a boost with some more immerrsive action packed battles.\\xa0 Some graphical upgrades on units, city upgrades, and even those ever present advisers. The upgrades were not just graphical but they added a little flair with some comedic situation with battles with the previously annoying barbarians as well as those advisors butting each other out of the way when advice is given. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Removing some of the minutia involved in previous games allows for more direct strategy. Your workers are now mostly automated, while you can tell them what the city should be focusing on you don't have to spend time send ing them to specific squares to change what's happening. Roads are also simplified with out taking away the strategic portion away by making roads cost gold that could be in short supply especially early on in games.\\xa0 There has also been a great improvement to the AI from Civ 4. Other civilization will now pay attention to what you are working on where you are weak and will exploit that regardless of how strong they might be. For instance, if Japan knows you are about to send a spaceship off to Aplha Centari they might go ahead and figure this would be a good time to change their government so they can attack you with everyhting they have to stop you from winning.\\xa0 If the Greeks know you have a Democracy and are about to wipe them off the face of the planet they're going to offer that olive branch knowing you have to accept it.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 While some of the hardcore Civilization fans may be a bit upset with the lack detail you can be involved with, the overall experience is very enjoyable and you wont find yourself sepnding 20+ hours on one game. Civ Lite it may be but thats fine by me...Pros: Fun fast pace action, Great Graphics upgrade, Good AI, no epic 3-4 day games.Cons: Occasional slows downs, PS3 controls can be slightly clunky at times, Must always be building something.\",\n",

SUM UP: The only real flaw in this game is that sometimes not doing the minor objective made future missions super hard.

       "  'description': 'Indiana Jones is the second franchise that Traveller\\'s Tales are bringing in to the world of Lego gaming, the first being Star Wars. The fact that Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures was released closely to the new Spielberg film - Kingdom of the Crystal Skull - is purely to get sales from the hype, as you will see no mention of an older Harrison Ford and his sidekick Mutt here, but instead playing through the first three original films.The main hub area is Barnett College (acting much like Dexter\\'s Diner did in Lego Star Wars), which has lots of secrets to discover and places to explore. Not only can you access the three main stories from here, but you can purchase characters for use in Free Play in the library, watch cutscenes in the theatre, admire your artefacts in the display room and more. Although you will not be spending the bulk of your time here, thought has still been put into each of the different rooms and the nooks and crannies.The game follows quite closely to the actual feature length films, and splits each one into six levels. Although not everything is exactly as it would be while watching the whip-bearing adventurer on your TV, it comes pretty close, all lovingly recreated in clever level designs. All the memorable moments are still here, including the iconic boulder run and the helicopter, boat and tank fight scenes. However, as this game is rated for everyone, moments such as Toht\\'s face melting off have been replaced with his Lego head comedically falling off.In Lego Indiana Jones you will never get tired of the puzzles that are presented to you. New tricks are always presented to you, with some parts having you find bricks and assembling them to build something, while others have you jumping on top of trucks and beating up any enemy that comes near you. It\\'s this wide experience that the game offers that really makes everything exciting and fresh, meaning that you won\\'t get the feeling of \"been there, done that\". Some of the characters you play as have phobias, which are puzzles to solve in themselves. Indiana Jones is scared of snakes, and you will have to switch to the other character and find some way to clear the route so you can advance in the stage. Other characters also have their own weaknesses, such as being scared of spiders or rats.As mentioned earlier, humour plays a part in Lego Indy. Although you will not be rolling on the floor laughing out loud as you would be on an internet forum, the game will scuffle a small chuckle out of you every now again in the no-speech cut scenes, ranging from the Star Wars references (such as the knight\\'s shadow looking - and sounding! - like Darth Vader) and Indiana wearing a girl\\'s blonde wig. The gags don\\'t just stop at the cutscenes however, and as you play through the game you will notice things such as a Lego interpretation of the Mona Lisa and Sphinx hanging on the wall. Humour is hard to pull off in a game, but it has been done well in this case.You are not alone in any level, and you will always have at least one other AI with you, whom you can switch to at anytime to take advantage of their attributes (or just because you like them). The problem here is that most of the time you\\'ll just want to be playing as the star of the show himself, not only to just constantly whip things for fun. The artificial intelligence in the game is not the best, and sometimes you will see them falling down gaps that could have easily been made. Luckily, drop-in/drop-out gameplay features a big part. At anytime your friend can pick up a controller and jump into the action and help you solve puzzles. You cannot do this via a wireless connection, but this would have been a pointless addition. The fun is having your friend by your side and talking to them, working as a team to solve the tasks.Another problem in the game is the enemies that respawn. Although not a nuisance in all cases, there are a couple of sections where you are trying to solve a puzzle and enemies just keep flying at you over and over again, no matter how many times you blast them to bricks. It can get frustrating, but luckily this doesn\\'t happen very much at all, and calms down once you have got past the mass of enemies. Finally, controlling a vechile such as a bike or a car can sometimes be a tiny bit tricky, and leaves you feeling like it could have been tightened up. Although in saying this, the problem is not constant and is only more apparent in smaller environments.Each level you play is packed to the brim with hidden goodies and secret areas. You will not be able to get 100 percent on the first play through of the game, but you will instead have to purchase characters for use in the Free Play mode, which gives you an incentive to pick up the coins as you go along. Each type of character has a special ability that helps you advance in the game, whether that is the bonus content or not. Indiana Jones has his brown whip, which allows him to swing across gaps nimbly and grab objects that are out of reach. There are also women who can jump higher, small characters who can squeeze through small gaps, guards with rocket launchers that blow up metal and more. These wide range of abilities and concealed areas makes the game crying out for a second play through to unlock everything there is on offer.As this is a Games for Windows PC game, it means this game will play with the Xbox 360 controller out the box (providing you have the necessary equipment). This would be the better option, as the game feels like it was made for playing with it, and will make your overall game experience better. Although there is nothing wrong with the keyboard itself, you can get much more precision with the controller.Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures is, quite simply, just plain awesome. You will not have sleepless nights over the difficulty of this game, but this doesn\\'t mean that some of the puzzles aren\\'t tricky to solve, or possibly most importantly; fun. Fans of the Indiana Jones series will get the most kicks out of this game, but non-whipping veterans will still have a great time here.',\n",

       " {'deck': 'The Elder Scrolls IV: Shivering Isles',\n",
       "  'description': \"Last year I called Oblivion my favorite game of 2006, and that opinion sticks. Good points can be made about the generic fantasy setting, reduced depth compared to Morrowind, and some promises less than completely fulfilled, like the new AI which had some silly problems. But I still enjoyed the hell out of it for a long time, and continued to do so long after I wrote that. Pretty recently I added a whole bunch of content, including most of the add-ons, the enjoyable Knights of the Nine quest line, scads of user-created stuff, and the expansion released last year, Shivering Isles. It all adds to an already huge game, and Isles in particular revitalized my interest in the game and its history.Shivering Isles doesn't do that much to improve gameplay, there is some interesting additional weapons and magic, but it plays largely the same. What's great about it is how it steps up the enjoyability of the atmosphere. If you get into it, the Elder Scrolls series has some interesting lore and really intricate detail to it, although that's somewhat obscured by the blandness of Cyrodill, the province of Tamriel Oblivion mostly takes place in. That's not a problem with the expansion, which ships you over to the realm of Sheogorath, one of the other Daedric princes, who happens to be completely insane. Instead of lush hills and deciduous forests, the landscape is peppered with gigantic plants and mushrooms and all sorts of winding paths. Every resident is almost as crazy as Sheogorath in their own, unique way, and in contrast to Oblivion's pervasive seriousness, Shivering Isles is genuinely funny. It's always fun to meet new people and discover exactly what psychosis is bothering them that day. Sheogorath is the star attraction, and as far as talking heads that serve only to give you your next quest go, he's one of the most entertaining to listen to.There's improvement in the amount of choice you have, too. Many quests in Oblivion gave you some choice about which way to go with a certain dilemma and the consequences varied, but those were mostly isolated incidents. There are a few choices you have in Isles that have real resonance with how the rest of the entire game plays out. It's still mostly the same, but it's different enough that your decisions seem to have an actual impact. In addition to all these design improvements, it's still an entertaining, rewarding RPG, and my only real complaint is that too many of the side quests are really just fetch quests, even if what you're fetching is more interesting than it usually is. There's still plenty I haven't seen, but I'd recommend it to anyone who has any interest in the series.\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'Deus Ex',\n",
       "  'description': \"I got this and the sequel on Steam last summer, although it took me a while to really get into the game. It was difficult at first, because the game was released back in 2000 and now looks and plays pretty archaically. But if you can get past that, the design shows through as one of the most innovative and important first person shooters there are. Deus Ex was fusing action and role-play elements before it was cool. Choice is the essence of the game. There are so many ways you can go about each mission. You can run through the front door, guns blazing, or hack the security systems to fight on your side, or find a hidden entrance and sneak your way in. There are often situations that aren't that dangerous, where you can just explore and soak up the details of the interesting world, with NPC's who have things to say and useful information around every corner. You can shape the game to help out your style, as completing objectives and finding new things gives you skill points to improve your use of weapons and ability to interact, and you can find augmentation canisters that give you a choice of different abilities, like quick healing, super strength, or night vision. There's not enough in the world to have it all, so you have to decide. You can also find upgrades for augmentations or your weapons to beef them up.It's not all perfect though. A downside of the skill system is that your accuracy is terrible in the beginning, forcing you to stand still for a few seconds if you want to have any chance to hit a distant enemy, which usually isn't that convenient. Putting too much into your weapon skills hamstrings your ability to do other things like pick locks, limiting where you can go. Luckily, you can get a weapon maybe halfway through that renders other weapons unnecessary, at least from a certain distance. It's a pretty long game, maybe a little too long. You can only infiltrate so many installations, killing the same enemies, before it gets a little tiring. This is exacerbated by the game, at least through Steam, not letting you continue at any point, so if you mess up, which is pretty easy to do, you have to load from your last manual save. It's still quite a good game though, with an interesting story about a government conspiracy, and continuing with the theme of choice, there are three different endings you can choose from. What it did paved the way for a lot of other games, and is appreciable for that if nothing else.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Penny Arcade Adventures: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness is a fun game with a long winded title. The game offers a good Japanese-RPG style game mixed in with a point and click adventure and some Penny Arcade humor. I never read PA before getting this game and I still enjoyed it so let's just get it out of the way that you don't have to be a PA fan to like this game. That being said you do have to like J-RPGs at least a little.   While this is a J-RPG it is a very light J-RPG. There is very little grinding and it is fairly linear compared to other games in the genre. There are potions and special attacks for battle but the attacks are not complicated.  The battle system is in real time so you can't just sit there thinking about what attacks to perform. You have items that you can use, a regular attack, a few special attacks, some support characters and some blocks at your disposal. After battle your characters level up and learn new abilities as in any other RPG.  The faithfulness to the PA comic strip is very good. The humor is definitely intact. There are lots of nerdy/gamey jokes such as how you role a 20 sided die at the beginning of battle to see who goes first and that your weapon through the whole game is a rake. The graphics reproduce the comic's visual style pretty well although I still feel like there is something missing.  There is very little sound in the game. There is no voice acting and generally   the only thing accompanying you through the world is some quiet, repetitive music. This all makes sense though because the whole game is made to look like a comic strip.  Overall the game is very good. The story is silly and over the top but that's what makes it funny. $20 is a little pricey for a game that takes about 5-6 hours to finish and offers no real reason to play through again. That being said though the 5-6 hours are a blast and you should still check it out because it is a funny, solid RPG.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Judged next to the original Deus Ex, the sequel can be considered a disappointment. People loved the first game, and most of the similarities the games share are top-level concepts and not the execution of those concepts. If it was its own thing, I think it would have been better received, but as a sequel, it definitely feels simplified for a broader audience, alienating the fans the series already had. It's still about playing a person trained and cybernetically modified to be the perfect soldier, in a directed yet flexible storyline featuring corruption and conspiracy, with a level of freedom in how you go about your tasks. In some ways, you have even more freedom than the first game, with the (somewhat irrelevant) choice of gender and often multiple conflicting objectives to consider, rather that just the occasional side quest. As nice as that sounds though, the opposing forces don't actually offer that much potential for interesting ramifications. Leaders of a faction will warn you that you're angering them if you keep going against their wishes, but they never actually stop giving you the opportunity to help them. Near the end, enemies will or will not attack you based on what you've done recently, but like the first game, there are multiple endings and you can side with whoever you want regardless of what you actually did the rest of the time.There are some game design choices I didn't much like either. The weapon system is dumbed down, with only two mods allowed per firearm and generic ammunition that takes some strategy out of resource management and screws you if you ever get too trigger happy. Biomod canisters are generic as well, and it's disappointing that you can only have access to five powers besides light at a time, especially when among these is the ability to hack computers, which you can always do in the first game and usually comes in quite handy. One thing the game unfortunately has in common with its predecessor is poor shooting gameplay, which is generally okay since it's more of an RPG most of the time but irritating when you do get in a big fracas. The story is pretty decent, although it seems to wish it was more interesting that it really is, and it seems a bit lazy when the same twist is used in both the main plot and a sidestory. They might have been trying to make a point with that, I just didn't like it. They did some nice things separating it from the first game while still tying them together in the end, though. While it did have some problems, I don't like it when people expect the sequel to march in lockstep with the original every time, and I found it to be a good experience most of the way through. I heard it was quite buggy when it launched, but now that it's on Steam a few years later that seems to be mostly ironed out. Usually you expect a video game sequel to be better, but just because it isn't doesn't mean it's bad.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Ok here's the thing you either love this game or not and I would think most people love it. The game has two games in one, one you play as solid snake on a tanker mission and raiden on the plant mission. The story line is excellent and told with the use of lenthy cut scenes which work really well and look amazing. The graphics are fantastic from the detail of the guns you aim to the cloths that you where and the detail of the tanker and the big shell. When you are high up on the plant chapter (strut E heliport is a good place) I would highly advice that you just look through your scope to see the detail of everything. The sound is excellent which each weapon making a different and unique noice, there is different themed music for sneaking around different areas and getting caught. Voice acting is great (and it should be for all the talking in this game).The gameplay for MGS2 is amazing you do a veriety of things such as bomb disposel, using disguises, swim, hang of ledges and much more.The game itself will last for a long time if you take in the story, but even then you will want to play it again and again to seek out things you may have missed, collect all weapons and items and play on different difficultly settings. The main reason to keep at the game however is dog tags. There is lots to collect, basically they are name tags on the soliders which you can collect and they are different on all of the difficulties.All in all i got this game when it first came out and still play on it to this game, in my thought I think it will remain one of the greatest games of all time. \",\n",

       "  'description': \"Compared to some other shooters, Team Fortress 2 a bit simple at first glance, with only a handful of maps and modes of play. The nine different classes have a few weapons, which seems like it might not give them that much to do. But the depth of design you discover once you actually start playing is impressive. The wildly different character designs make it easy to know exactly what you're dealing with, which gives the game a more strategic feel than it might otherwise have with such a fast pace. You're going to react differently when you see a soldier coming at you than you will when you see a sniper or a pyro. There's a lot of interesting dynamics, like the common heavy/medic relationship and always being on the watch for a spy in disguise. It's a very addicting, fun game that I'd probably play a lot more if something about spending a lot of time on multiplayer didn't rub me the wrong way.The game deserves credit for its graphics too. It was a big leap to go for a cartoony style instead of the typical realistic graphics in an M-rated shooter, but it paid off and made the game even more enjoyable. It's really easy to tell who is who, which affects the gameplay greatly, and it's also just cool to look at. There's something much funnier about the content/graphic clash than you see in most games. The amount of personality they injected into the characters of a team-based shooter is noteworthy. I don't know about the community on the consoles, but it's still really popular on PC, so if you don't have The Orange Box, just get it already.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'When Super Star Wars was released in 1992, it was probably considered to be a very cutting edge game. It had amazing 2D graphics along with some impressive \"3D\" vehicle sequences....but it also had something that you don\\'t see much of these days in games: extreme difficulty.  The game loosely follows Episode IV: A New Hope. Now when I say \"loosely\" I mean it. It takes certain liberties with the story of the movie so it can make the game work like...well, a game! Sure, Luke didn\\'t slaughter hundreds of Jawas to get R2-D2 but without these kinds of changes the game would be even shorter than it already is (takes 3-4 hours to beat) so I think it\\'s warranted.  Super Star Wars is a game that can be both incredibly frustrating and yet very fun at the same time. It\\'s a pretty unforgiving platformer and there are no save game slots and no passcode system whatsoever so (in true old school fashion) if you want to beat the game, you do it in one sitting. You only get a few lives and a small number of continues at your disposal and you better make good use of them even on the \"Easy\" difficulty.  About 2/3rds through the story you get the ability to control the smuggler Han Solo and his Wookiee companion Chewbacca. Unfortunately these other characters don\\'t add much of a difference. With Han you start out automatically with a blaster power-up in your arsenal and with Chewie you get a larger health bar at the start. It doesn\\'t add much and these are already things that you can collect with Luke rather easily.   Then there\\'s the \"landspeeder sequences\" where for whatever reason you have to kill a set number of Jawas before you proceed to where you want to go. It really doesn\\'t make a lot of sense and it\\'s almost as if the developers REALLY didn\\'t like Jawas or something. Yet...like the game itself, it\\'s still quite a bit of crazy weird fun.  Though its steep difficulty and its strange story changes may turn off some of today\\'s gamers, Super Star Wars is still a whole lot of classic platforming Star Wars fun that will test your skills and remind you how much games have changed over the years.',\n",

No other game has a unique story like this one. You start out young and hook up with a gang with a killer plan but then get turned on. During this part of the game you play 1978 where the cars buildings ect. look like they would in that era even the HUD is appropriate. Then you get thrown in jail and 28 years later get released and are out for your old gang members. During this time you character looks different there are different cars and the HUD has changed this is what makes it so great. No other game has achieved this. The cars handle realisticly and fell like proper cars. Free roaming around new york is great there is 260km of road to explore and along with the main missions there are side missions to do which makes the game last for ages (sure this is like GTA but who cares it works).You can now also shoot out of your car whilst driving which is a great new addidtion. Speaking of cars there are almost endless numbers you can drive (80+). A really cool part of this game is fully collecting and customizing the vehicle's you come across. Overall sure it may be similar to GTA but there is so much to do in this game and a good veriety of things to do. \",\n",

This is not a gimmick (okay, maybe it is) and it is not a bad game. Not bad at all. Now where should I start? Oh yes, the storyline... yeah there isn\\'t much of that. Basically, you are a cop on mega-steroids and you need to kill the gangstaz. To wipe out the gangstaz from their homes, you must kill 7 bosses of each gang (there are 3 gangs) which makes 21 bosses in all. That may seem like a lot, but you can pin them down fast. When you start the game, your character will be pretty wimpy looking. There\\'s a cure for that. You will have skills in Agility, Driving, Explosives, Strength and Firearms that want to be leveled. To level your agility, there are \"agility orbs\" on buildings, billboards and even a clown, if you want to level strength, kick people (not pedestrians, as much as you want to, try not to kill them) to level firearms, shoot gangstaz, for driving, run over gangstaz, and for explosives, blow up gangstaz.There are 4 stages of each skill and when you level a skill, you might notice a subtle difference in your character\\'s appearance. You will get addicted to leveling up. I literally spent 14 straight hours on a Saturday night without sleep with my friend doing co-op. It was so much fun finding ways to screw around with pedestrians and launching yourself over jumps with the SUV, and the highlight of the night: Jumping off the Agency Tower.

       "  'description': 'Finally. Okami for the Wii. I had seen a bit of this game back when it arrived at the PS2, but being a person that more or less dislike Playstation, I did not want to know too much about the game. If I did, I would most likely needed a PS2 just for this game. But now it is here, and I knew I had to have it. I knew precious little about the game. I knew you played a wolf, which also happened to be the sun god. I also knew you could use the \"Celestial Brush\" to paint, and I knew it had interesting graphics. So I buy it, I put it on, and boy was I in for a ride.  From the very start, with the traditional Japanese art in the intro, I was hooked. In the beginning of the game, I did think it would be a slow game, with a lot of dialogue and cutscenes, \\'cause it did take I while before you could really... well, move. But I soon learned that the game was not slow in any way.  You play Amaterasu, the Sun God (goddess, but in the game she is genderless), which has taken the form of a white wolf. Right away you meet up with a strange little fellow called Issun. Which is small in the basic sense of the word, as he is mistaken for a bug several times. Your quest is to vanquish the eight-headed serpent demon called Orochi. which has covered the land in darkness. To do this you will have to rejuvenate the guardian saplings spread about. Sounds easy? Well, it isn\\'t that hard. But it sure is fun.  You see, you have a powerful tool at your disposal. The Celestial Brush. With this, you pause the game, and use the very game world as your canvas. As you progress through the game, you learn new techniques you can use. It doesn\\'t take long before you can slice things in half, make bombs out of thin air, make the sun appear in the sky and make living things grow. All of the techniques have specific uses important for your quest, but some can also be used more for fun. Like the rejuvenation technique, which you need for those saplings, can also simply be used to make plants appear. Or grow threes which lasts for a few seconds. It is really fun. And while some things are a bit hard to get right in the beginning, or even at the end (circles can be a pain), the motion controls usually work well. They are worse in combat actually.  Which is pretty easy. Shake the wii-mote, and you attack. If you wear a deflector, you hit once. To use combos, you need to time the next shake. This is where I have had some problems, since my frantic shaking often doesn\\'t register. But using rosary beads is another story. You just need to shake once, latch the beads onto an enemy, then shake shake shake! Yes, it might seem too easy, but throw in a lot of moves you can do, plenty of weird enemies and lots of brush techniques... believe me, combat is fun.  And for the graphics... beautiful. Simply beautiful. The colorful waterpaint-look is gorgeous, and I really love it. There are some few graphical problems here and there, but they are so few it doesn\\'t matter. Some of the graphics will leave you just sitting there. Like the first time you rejuvenate an area. You see, before you do that, the area will be mostly a Cursed Zone. A bleak desert of red, black and grey. But when you liven up the guardian sapling... true beauty in a video game. Seriously. I am playing through the game a second time now, skipping every dialogue and video, except those. It is great to watch.  Even though this is a traditional adventure game ala Legend of Zelda, you can level up a few things, giving it a bit of an RPG touch. Your healthbar, number of inkpots, extra life slots and purse can all be upgraded as long as you have enough praise. Which you receive by doing good deeds. Feed animals, dig up four-leaf clovers and rejuvenating them etc all give you praise.  Storywise this game is far above most games these days. Rooted deeply in japanese folklore, you get a lot of story for your money. There are always new twists, always new things to take in. And when you think you have beaten the game, you learn that you are really not even halfway there. In addition to that, you have a lot of optional things to do, sidequests, things to search for, and just places to explore. I spent 34 hours beating the game the first time. About 2 of those are pure exploring. And I still have heaps of things to find and do.  So it is a good thing the game comes with something most adventure games should have. A \"game+ mode\". That is, once you have beaten it, you can start over. Just with your character as she was at the end of the game. You still need to get all the quest related items, and some of the more powerful items, as most of your moves. So you cannot doublejump, use the best weapon in the game, or use any of your celestial brush-techniques right away. But everything else is intact.  Even the music is great. The first time I hear the Shinsu Field song, I knew I would love this game more and more.  You have to look long for a game like this. And I am pretty sure there won\\'t be one for many years. Everything from the graphics to the story is superb, making this one of the best experiences I have had on my Wii, and it even is one of my best gaming experiences ever. So if you haven\\'t already done so, buy this game. It is the least you can do.',\n",

       "  'description': 'As the developer and publisher of the first two games (and the 80\\'s expansion) were split and gobbled up by different companies, a new team gained control of creating the enjoyable rhythm series, and the results aren\\'t quite what you\\'d hope for. There\\'s nothing about the third installment changed so much as to hurt the core gameplay, it just seems every single new decision Neversoft made was a bad one. The graphics received an overhaul, with new, shinier character models and notes on the fretboard. The changes don\\'t improve anything, they just completely remove any charm the characters originally had (Judy Nails did not need huge breasts) and I\\'m not sure if it\\'s the new notes or just a slight programming difference, but playing the songs never feels quite as natural as it used to. Not only are the characters uglier, but Pandora, my personal favorite, is completely missing. They took out co-op freeplay for no reason, and the boss battles are contrary to what\\'s actually fun about the series, playing along to songs you know, not twiddling on meaningless solos while being interrupted by annoying power-ups.In the end, what\\'s important is the songs, and Guitar Hero III does have quite a few good ones, like \"Paint it Black\" and \"Knights of Cydonia\". The difficulty is ramped up if you compare it to earlier entries, and it\\'s to the point where the note charts are needlessly complex for the sake of it, just to increase the challenge. This is especially evident if you compare the difficulty of the few songs that are in this and Rock Band back to back; the Rock Band versions are easier because they match closer to what it actually sounds like you should be playing. Guitar Hero is supposed to be fun with a group of people, but as it moves towards esoteric, excessively difficult songs, they risk alienating that crowd and giving the party scene to Rock Band, which I think is already happening. It\\'s not a direction I\\'m too interested in.',\n",

It is not a good thing if you are caught as enemies just keep coming and coming soon you will run out of ammo or die so it is best to keep your head down on this game.The gameplay is great but so is the storyline. It is told very well with the use of cut-scenes which offer a nice break from gameplay and to follow the actual story. There is some simple puzzles to work out such as working out secret codec calls and avoiding lasers.Sound is great with the guns sounding great and the added effect of them sounsing differently depending on where you are (for example in an air duct or out in open space). The music for certain areas also changes.You could properly complete the game within a few hours if you rushed through it and skipped the cut scenes, but u'll properly want to play it through properly finding all the weapons and follow the story. You may also want to play it through again to see the added extras after completeing the game once.There is nothing particually bad about this game and that why it gets a perfect 10 out of 10! \",\n",

       "  'description': \"Last year, when the Rock Band/Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock battle was warming up, I was in the Guitar Hero camp. Despite the original developer making Rock band, I already liked Guitar Hero, I liked some of the announced songs more, and I didn't like the idea of paying that huge amount for the whole instrument set. Issues like that tend to go away though when the new Guitar Hero developer makes some bad decisions, you have a ton of downloadable songs to improve the library, and someone else in the house is paying for all of it, as was the case with my roommate. Nailing a hard song in Guitar Hero is a great feeling, but it doesn't compare to a group of people working together to put a whole song together. Harmonix went after the group experience with Rock Band, and nailed it perfectly. I don't play it solo much at all, it's best played with four, although it's also fun with three (the computer taking over the singing, of course).People don't often volunteer to sing around here, it can make you feel pretty self-conscious, especially when you screw up. But it doesn't matter too much if everyone's having fun, and nobody cares if you suck, as long as it doesn't cause your group to lose fans. Drums are also a lot of fun. It's easy to accidentally hit the rim instead of a pad and miss a note you feel you should have gotten, and I still haven't tried hard because it's a scary proposition, but keeping a beat is a hell of a lot of fun. Guitar and bass play like they do in Guitar Hero, although I feel like I miss repeated notes more often like I should sometimes and I'm not a huge fan of the silent strum bar. But the nice part about that is you can use the Guitar Hero guitar in Rock Band if you want, although Activision won't allow the opposite. Career mode has a lot of seemingly pointless quirks, like requiring your band leader to be there and not allowing created characters to switch instruments, but it's still fun touring around, gaining fame and fortune. Sets can get repetitive when you keep playing the same songs, but usually there's enough freedom that you can basically play what you want. I don't intend to put much of my own money into the rhythm game market in the future, but if I had to pick a game to play, at least for a while, it'd be Rock Band.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'When has there been a time that I didn’t agree with crashing beautiful and expensive cars? Ah, yes, real life. Thanks to Burnout Paradise, gamers can now treat their gas pedal-happy hearts with crashing, jumping, racing, drifting, burning, and the ability to defy physics by turning your car over and wreaking havoc throughout Paradise City. Sound good? If it doesn’t, then let me elaborate for you on this great addition to a beloved franchise.  In the beginning of the game, you start out with a broken and beaten car, but have no fear, because the “drive-right-thru” repair shop will fix that up for you. These repair shops can become vital to you in races when your car has been taken down or has wrecked several times, but when in free roam, the damage taken is merely cosmetic. Unlike the past Burnout games, Paradise is completely open world with the given ability to start races, stunt trials, a survival game called Marked Man, and Road Rage where the objective is to take as many cars out until you die. To start an event, just look on your mini map and drive to said marked event.  The races are pretty straight-forward where you start at one point and get to another. You have a choice on what routes you take to arrive at the end, but take precautions on which ones will get you there, because every millisecond counts. In Stunt Run, you get as many points as you can by getting air, crashing through billboards, drifting and doing barrel rolls. Marked Man is basically a race, you just aren’t against anyone, but you can’t wreck or get taken down, so take your time and stay comfortable. The most amusing event for me is Road Rage, where you take down a number of cars before you die. The difficulty is a little easier than a race or Stunt Run however it isn’t too large of an issue. The reason you wish to win these objectives is to gain new vehicles and upgrade your drivers’ license and get more new vehicles… that and achievement points, which are a guilty pleasure of my own and plenty others. The one other mode that has also been added is Showtime where you press the bumpers and your car just turned into a rolling metal deathball. The objective is to create as much damage as possible for as long as possible. It may sound completely awesome on paper, but when a car is bouncing around the city for as long as seven minutes, you seem to forget that this is a racing game that you’re playing. Sure, you want to see the sites. That’s the reason you are taking a vacation in Paradise City, right? The visuals are pretty when the cars are pretty and gritty when they’re gritty. Paradise’s graphics still don’t match up to Forza 2’s, but they certainly get the job done for a jam packed game. You won’t get a ton of time to admire the scenery when the annoying voice of DJ Atomica enters your mind every ten seconds or so. I swear EA could have gotten a better guy for free. I would rather have a homeless man who can hardly make complete sentences so I would actually be humored. You do, for the most part have the option to rid the “tips” voice, but DJ Atomica doesn’t die easy. The online works seamlessly with the single player, so if you want to take down your buds or some random 12 year old, just press right on the D-Pad. There are a ton of online challenges and they can be fun or just plain frustrating. If youIf you A. Love Burnout, B. Like games, or C. Enjoy cars, you should definitely check out Burnout Paradise.',\n",

Metroid is not your every day shooter, or even one. This subject is even debated upon today, and still with differing opinions. With Super Metroid being the landmark title of the growing series, fans and gamers alike were unsure about a 3D Metroid…Developed by Retro Studios, and published by Nintendo, you already can tell this is going to be one of the best games made on a Nintendo platform. With that being said, Metroid Prime 3 is best enjoyed by the hardcore gamer, and least enjoyed by your granny.You don’t need to play the other 2 classic games to fully enjoy, or understand the storyline. Rather, just look up the information on the internet, everything else is explained clearly throughout. Apparently a virus has affected the Federations supercomputers/Aurora Unit. With backed up proof, the Federation knows the Pirates are the one’s who are up to something. With Valhalla already attacked, and Norion, the military base of the Federation also attacked, you and your fellow hunters have a lot of investigating to do on the other planets. The storyline becomes deeper if you scan, which shows you ‘behind the scenes’ of the Federation and Pirates, creating great atmosphere.Bryyo- The home of golems, Elysia- the futuristic heavenly skytown, the abandoned Valhalla, and other planets all have unbeatable atmosphere. You feel as if your’re Samus, and that you can feel around your surroundings, as well. Prime 3’s level design is better executed than it predecessors. Every room is full of detail, and has challenging puzzles that will require you to think outside the Metroid box. Most rooms have so much depth it’s hard to just leave any room without investigating everything.Retro decided to take advantage of the Wiimote controls with more combat, without ditching the puzzles. The grapple beam plays a big role in the game, with grappling off pirate shields to jerking off plates and flipping switches and bars. You’ll also be required to turn around some gears, hack bases, push, pull, turn levers, and whatnot. You’ll also be interacting with many of your fancy gadgets in your ship. It all does not sound fun and maybe a bit gimmicky, but once you experience it, you’ll start to wonder why you never did something so often in past Prime’s.Prime 3 has well thought out bosses, and obviously very fun to fight. They all have the right difficulty thanks to the 3 difficulty options. Great music, diversity, and simply how to defeat them, brings a yet another Metroid game with a living, breathing, world.On top of that, charged beams all almost useless. The uncharged shot are obviously rapid fire, and are not that far behind the power of your charged shot, so just stick with rapid fire.As always, you are asked to do the dreaded fetch hunt! Who didn’t see it coming??? It’s a shame, because you’re just about to finish the game, then bam, fetch hunt. It’s easier though, because most of them are required to proceed onto the next area. But still, it’s a pain and will stack a couple hours of boredom. In my opinion, calling Prime a FPS is simply not true; there are too many immersive puzzles and powerups that I would label it a FPA. From the distinctiveness of the morph ball to the immersive grapple, this is easily the best game for Wii so far. If you never liked the Prime formula, chances are this game won’t change your mind. It’s safe to say Prime 3 has evolutionized upon its predecessors, not revolutionized. There are many new aspects in the game, but the goes the same for returning aspects. I’m not tired of the Prime formula, and I can’t imagine how anyone could.Prime 3 will take you around 15-20+ hours to finish the game on your first play through, a pretty lengthy game. There are 3 difficulties: Normal/Easy, Veteran/Medium, and Hyper/Hard. Some people say this is an easier Prime game; well you’re all playing on Normal! Due to fans saying Prime 2 was too hard, Retro has acted, as well as keeping your preference difficulty, including hard mode. Prime 3 also has achievements that you can cash in for extras, like 100 kills for instance. All of the extras are really nice, and unlike most games, you’ll actually be tempted to keep playing just to unlock these things. You know you want a Mii bobble head and bumper stickers on your ship!Prime 3 is the first game to really take advantage of the Wii’s engine/hardware, with silky smooth frame rate, gorgeous lighting, and special effects; you can’t see the brilliance in just pictures, but playing, or even watching the game in action. Although they’re not perfect, Wii can handle more than this, but superb nonetheless. Each and every piece of music is nothing short of a melody on the ears. The music fits compfortably in each area, boss battle, and cut scene. All voice acting in the game sounds nothing close to awkward, which is surprising considering it has never been done this heavily. This is only one of the many reasons why Prime 3 has such great atmosphere. The only minor downside is you will hear some top notch Prime 1 and 2 music. Why is that bad? Well, it’s not, but I just rather prefer the soundtrack to be completely new.You will hear criticism of MP3 because it does not have a deep online experience. In short, Metroid did not get itself where it’s at today because of multiplayer, but because of its quality single player adventure. Multiplayer is nice, but if Zelda can get away with it, why not Metroid?The good: Atmosphere, bosses, music, graphics, level design, voice acting, interaction, achievements, cutscenes.The Bad: Charged shots almost useless, not a completely new soundtrack, fetch hunt.',\n",

       "  'description': \"The Tom Clancy series has always been known for their realistic, tactical approach to the shooter genre, and the Rainbow Six series in particular has been Tom Clancy's longest running franchise as well as, arguably, their most popular. Rainbow Six Vegas carries out this tradition, but re-hauls the series in almost every way.\\xa0One way notice first about Vegas is its new cover system. On my opinion, this system is superior to Gears' system in about every way. All the player has to do to get behind cover is to pull the L trigger near any medium to large object, and use hte analog sticks to move around and aim from behind cover. The player can also 'pop out' of cover easily with a flick of the analog stick. This mechanic works very well, and, as mentioned previously, is better than Gears of War's.The gameplay all together is very solid. Shooting is marvelous and you can always see the reticule positioned over a terrorist's head. The different visions as well will be utilized, as the environments can become dark. Thermal, which has always annoyed me in past games, is actually pretty cool, and I used it on many occasions. However, the environments can become very dark and hard to see sometimes, and the visions really ruin the HD, next-gen nature of these games. Also, the levels as a whole can become either repetitive or dull in nature with the exception of many of the wide casino spaces and lobbies. The Mexican beginning feels like it begins more in Ghost Recon rather than Rainbow Six as well. Fortunately, complaints end about there.\\xa0The story, while nothing terribly original, immerses the player in a terrorist-infested world that the world of today is. Numerous attacks are being conducted throughout Vegas, and it is up to your team of three to stop it. Why they only use a team of three beats me, but it adds to the suspense. Speaking of which, this game is hard. I mean really hard. Not only on realistic will fairly-seasoned gamers become frustrated during some shootouts. It is very similar to some of COD4's frustratingly intense sequences, but, if you give it the effort, you will pass and make it to the next area. Also, a pretty difficult mode called Terrorist Hunt is part of single player and tasks you with eliminating an area of all the terrorists and scores you on that. It is really hard and requires determination considering no snake cams are allowed as well as you are alone without your team. It is a fun bonus mode on top of an already stellar game.Additionally, the multiplayer and co-op play is top-notch. Many modes and maps will keep any hardcore gamer satisfied (by the way, this gamer is not for the casual; it requires precision and is best suited for the experienced with a gamepad). To this day, numerous gamers still frag it out on the online matches, and rightfully so. Many will find COD4 and Halo 3's multiplayer options a little heftier in depth, but Rainbow Six Vegas was revolutionary for the time and still a hell of a lot of fun nowadays.\\xa0The feeling of leading your two elite soldiers through casinos never gets old, no matter how repetitive some of the levels can be. And that is the beauty of Vegas: the game is slightly flawed, but the positives greatly outnumber the negatives and I still don't regret giving this game such a high rating. It is truly that great. With the sequel approaching, I don't think I will trade in this game for the new one (which I normally do with sequels), and I feel as though my library of games will be incomplete without this one. With an excellent single player, a fun bonus diversion game, and one of the best multiplayer experiences on Xbox Live, Rainbow Six Vegas rocks and is quite simply, amazing.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'I don\\'t play many sports games at all, but I like baseball so I thought I\\'d try a new one. Most people preferred The Show to the 2K series this year, so I got that one. It\\'s a pretty fun and accurate simulation of the sport. The last baseball game I played was All-Star Baseball \\'99 for the Nintendo 64, with Larry Walker on the cover, so it\\'s been a while. In that time, pitching has gotten more involved and hitting has gotten harder. In that old game, you only had to pick a pitch and location and it would go there, and when batting, you could line up the icon with the pitch icon to swing at it. Now, you have to time a multi-part meter right to execute a pitch well, and hitting requires you to rely on your own vision much more and swing smartly. There are some helpers you can use to make it a little easier like pitch guessing, although the online league I\\'m in has them turned off because apparently they have amazing eyesight. Fielding and baserunning is pretty intuitive, and how close the gameplay has gotten to real baseball is impressive, although there are still some weird gaffes like runners taking bases when there\\'s no way they would have been able to, and stealing bases is a cakewalk.The presentation and commentary are pretty good. There are some weird inconsistencies, like an often repeated animation of the umpire throwing a ball to the pitcher without the ball ever actually going into his glove, and fan animation repeating too often, but the amount of stuff they crammed in is cool. Most of the big pitchers and hitters have authentic windups and batting stances, and there are nice touches like playing arguing close plays. Rex Hudler is annoying and some comments are either repeated too often or used in inappropriate situations, but it\\'s definitely better than it used to be.I haven\\'t played online much, but the integration of leagues and mail are nice, and weekly roster updates are great. I\\'ve spent a lot of time with the \"Road to the Show\" career mode, and besides missing most of my created pitcher\\'s rookie season with an out-of-nowhere \"fractured head\" injury, it\\'s pretty interesting to build up his skills and move him towards his goal. I wish your stats improved based on how you play instead of using arbitrary skill points, but it\\'s still cool. Too many little things prevent The Show from being a full experience. How does it not even have a home run derby, a simple feature present in that game I played nine years ago? It\\'s not important, but it\\'s something. I am not and will never be a sports gamer, but I\\'ll probably continue to get enjoyment out of this for a while.',\n",

NFL Head Coach lets you control almost everything within your football organization. This includes who your draft, who you sign (both players and coaches) and what your team does on and off the field. That is not all, as you can control your own career as an NFL Head Coach. You decide who you work for, what your philosophy is and how you motivate your players during practices and games.  The Story: You are the offensive or defensive coordinator (You choose which one you want to be) of the NFL Champions and now you are taking a stab at being an NFL Head Coach. Along the way you must make many decisions which can make or break your career. Your ultimate goal is to surpass the likes of Chuck Noll and Vince Lombardi, setting yourself as the greatest Head Coach of all time  The Gameplay is not as boring as it may sound; standing on the sidelines calling the plays, looking at the stats and analyzing the other team is just as exciting as controlling the players. In fact, I found that I could play this game longer and go through more games without stopping than I could with other football games (Including Madden NFL 2005, etc.)   There is great replay value in NFL Head Coach. Once you have completed one season or an entire career you can decide to work for a different team in a different league/division, you can utilize different motivation and philosophy tactics among other things which keep the game interesting.  I recommend this game to any legitimate football fan, who has ever found themselves calling the plays that should’ve been called while watching football. This game is also for anyone who has found themselves talking about which coaches should be fired/hired and which players should be traded/signed. For the people that fall into this category, it is time to stop condemning the real life coaches of the NFL football teams. It is time to create your own legacy and prove that you can do better than everyone else.   To those people who just watch a game or two a year or just the Superbowl, this game is not for you. You are better off with games in the Madden NFL Series.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Around the Christmas of 2001, there was a bit of a rivalry brewing between the PS2 and the new Xbox. Both systems had a high-profile game coming out. The PS2 had Metal Gear Solid 2, and the Xbox had Halo. But a lesser known game came out of nowhere to far more commercial success than either, a 3D sequel to a kitschy top-down driving series. It was GTA3, and it was a lot of fun. I remember playing it for the first time and being amazed by what I could do. It was the first true open-world game of its kind. The freedom was incredible. Going anywhere in the city, getting into fights with the different gangs, uncovering street races or secret jumps, listening to the hilarious talk radio station.Of course, what we ended up doing a lot was just causing mayhem, recklessly plowing through pedestrian traffic with a semi truck and getting as many cop cars as you could to chase you. It was a revelation when we realized the best way to rack up stars on your wanted level was to attack people on foot instead of just running them over. And of courses, you could pick up prostitutes to heal you in exchange for money, and if you so chose, kill them afterward to get it back. Money was never an issue in the game, it was just a darkly humorous way to beat the system. Unfortunately, this single aspect of a huge, often quite intelligent game was focused on by media watchdogs and overzealous parents. They warped it, trying to make the game out to be training kids to be brutal killers, with the mistreatment of women in the forefront. Never mind that the series has never once instructed you to harm a prostitute, or any other person who could be considered an innocent bystander. It just allows it, letting you make yourself into any character you wanted. The game also allows you to use an ambulance to deliver people to a hospital and rewards you for doing it well, but I guess that doesn't sell newspapers as well.Beyond the sandbox mayhem, the game also started the series' trend towards interesting storylines set up by very professionally handled cutscenes. The main character never spoke, but you still felt sympathy for him when he was betrayed and wanted to help him set things right. Working your way up the ladder, interacting with all the different movers and shakers in the criminal underworld, and having a hand in the direction the city takes was a hell of a lot of fun. Everybody latches on to the primitive technology and unsatisfactory weapon targeting now, but it wasn't that big of a deal back then, when you had so much choice in how you took care of things. Other games let you decide between picking off foes from a distance or getting in their face and making them explode, but few let you set up a barrier beforehand and block off their escape route. It started the trend of making the last couple of missions in the game a little too difficult, when you're faced with tons of guys with automatic weapons and the bad targeting really rears its ugly head, but finally getting it done is all the more satisfying. There were too many technical flaws, but when you just consider the scope of it and what it did for gaming as a whole, Grand Theft Auto III was a masterpiece.\",\n",

Take that for what you will, but I'm the kind of person that typical finishes every game I play.  I've been a fan of FPSs for several years now and a fan of RPGs for as long as I can remember, so you can imagine that I though that STALKER would be a perfect fit for me. Everything about this game sounded interesting to me when I decided to but it. Unfortunately, I started running into problems almost as soon as I started playing. My computer easily exceeded most of the game's recommended requirements and yet it chugged like Thomas the Train-engine through out most of the game. The controls were another issue; it took me a good fifteen minutes to rearrange the controls so that they resembled something that was actually meant for human fingers, and even then some of the controls (like the backwards mouse wheel when zooming) were unchangeable. Even after all this the controls still felt clunky much of the time (why is it that I can only sprint straight forwards?).  The RPG elements were probably the biggest disappointment. finding, organizing and completing quests often felt like a chore. They were usually vague and frequently wore down into a monotonous grind as you slowly walk (you're severely limited on how far you can run) huge distances to complete quests. Compounding this, I also sometimes found quests spontaneously declaring themselves failed if I didn't manage to get back to the quest giver soon enough. The inventory management system was even worse. By the time you add your armor, the huge variety of health items you'll need, your weapons and ammo your character is walking at a snail's pace and every time you need to pick up something you're more than likely going have to drop something else. The weapons were a particularly big problem as ammo was ALWAYS in short supply. Some people feel that the constantly hunt for ammo added to the game's atmosphere and believability, I think it was just a constant cloud that hovered over my enjoyment of this game.  The environments were fitting for the nuclear waist-land theme with lots of signs of abandoned urban decay and strange mutant lifeforms everywhere. However, even here there were some disappointments. First, the sound was all around dull and almost absent in the longest stretches of waits-land where it could have been used to break the tedium. Second, there were to many areas with little going on in them beyond an occasional mutant or bandit. Third, after a while all of the urban decay and barren waist-land begins to look the same.  I'm not sure what to say about the game's story line. Judging by walk-throughs it seems that I got a little over half way through the game before calling it quits. In that time I only found myself growing more confused by the main quests and the infrequent, vague cutsceens. Maybe all that would have made since in the end, but it definitely wasn't driving me forward in an attempt to see what happened next.  I really wanted to like this game, but ultimately its flaws overshadowed its strengths for me. Maybe other people can look past them and find a good game underneath, but I'm not one of them and I can't recommend this game on the off chance that someone else may be one of the lucky ones.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth was in development for an exceedingly long time so the fact that the game kind of fell behind the graphical curve is understandable but still unfortunate. Even though the game certainly doesn't look like anything special from a technical standpoint, it more than makes up for it by providing you with an unsettling atmosphere and a head-trip of a storyline.I am completely unfamiliar with the written works of H.P. Lovecraft but all I can say regarding this game is it has moments of sheer horror and dread that few games provide. The game does some really creative things with the first person perspective. It has no HUD, which is often a problem in most games but it serves to really immerse you in the games gothic world. Also, your character's vision will blur should you stare at something exceptionally grotesque or threatening for to long, which may sound irritating but it really helps make you fear some of the game's enemies. The game is actually at its best when you are completely defenseless and must avoid enemies altogether. Once you do get some weapons (which isn't for at least an hour of gameplay) some of the games more troublesome problems become apparent. The enemy AI is pretty bad, rarely making any effort to avoid your attacks. Also, some areas simply have infinite foes making attack a pretty poor option, though the game doesn't really inform you of this. Still, the real star of the show is the dark storyline and the excellent atmosphere the game provides. It may not be a good looking game, but its still worth experiencing. \",\n",

       "  'description': 'One of the things we’re taught to do when we write is to leave ourselves out of whatever we’re writing. I\\'m not supposed to say \"I\" or \"me\" or anything relating to myself, but consider that rule broken. This is one of those rare cases where I will break the fourth wall. Why? Well, the experience that I’ve had with Bioshock is one that I can only tell from my perspective. Bioshock is a game that will leave a different impression on everyone who plays it. It’s a game that can be seen as many types of games, depending on who you are, and what you play. Bioshock is geared towards the thinking man, who ponders human nature, society, war and ideologies. Bioshock is also geared towards the hardcore gamer, who searches for that deep, immersive and mesmerizing game experience that seems all too rare these days. It doesn’t just stop there; it might be a game that caters to the first-person shooter lover, or the guy that loves survival horror games. Bioshock can be many things, and that’s why I’m going to talk about my take on the game, and what it meant to me. One thing is certain though; everyone should take a trip down to Rapture.   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Rapture is an underwater city created by Andrew Ryan in the 1950’s. Ryan designed this underwater city in order to break free from the chains and limitations of the world above -- no government or religion could restrain him or the people of Rapture. These people who flocked down to Rapture were promised all of the things they couldn’t have on the surface, which was a better life in a city that actually cared about it’s people. Rapture’s breakthroughs in science allowed these people to genetically enhance themselves as well. The ugly could become the beautiful, and the weak could become the powerful. Rapture was perfect, or it at least seemed to be. Something went horribly wrong, and the bustling city of  became a city of horrors -- civilians killing each other, and even their families and children. Suddenly, Andrew Ryan’s masterpiece land is the living dead. Rapture still stood, but Rapture had fallen. And with that, here you come. You’re sitting inside a cargo plane, and it suddenly crashes down to the sea below. You manage to escape the wreckage, but you find yourself swimming around a ring of fire from the plane, and the threat of the sinking parts pulling you below. There’s a lighthouse-like structure in the distance, and you swim to it. What lies inside is the entrance to an incredible creation. Your goal is to find out what’s going on with Rapture, and why it has fallen. Soon, the mysterious answers to the city’s demise will come to light, but the once preserved city is facing destruction as part of your plane crashes into it. \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Setting is clearly the most important aspect of this game, with the city of  being one of the most alarmingly moody and atmospheric settings you’ll ever find in a video game. I was completely engrossed in the creepy preserved world of Rapture. I was on my toes as I explored the city, hearing the faint sound of a splicer (civilian enemy) mumbling incoherently to himself while a nearby jukebox played an old 1950’s song. Old posters posted up on the walls advertising the once-helpful-turned-dangerous gene splicing procedures are found everywhere, with “You Ruined Me” written in blood over top of a few of them. Then there were those picket signs thrown about that represented some kind of revolt against Rapture, indirectly alluding to some kind of civil unrest. Of course, there was the uncontrollable flooding, like a relentless timer ticking down as it seeped in and destroyed each area. I couldn’t help but keep asking myself “what could have happened here?” Much of the backstory of Bioshock is told in these subtle ways, which is a brilliant method of storytelling. Learning more about Rapture and what happened is as simple as observing your surroundings. I spent a lot of time just stopping and observing each area, trying to piece together the fall of Rapture by looking at the writings on the wall. There are even tape recordings left around, which tell accounts of the happenings of the city, from a civilian’s perspective. There are even recordings of Andrew Ryan and his cohorts, explaining their rhymes and reasons for their actions -- trust me, those “actions” demand some explaining.   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 When I wasn’t investigating all of the little clues left behind, I was admiring the masterful design of each and every area of Rapture. Not only does Bioshock have some of the best visuals on next generation platforms, but it has some of the greatest artistic style I’ve ever seen. It perfectly captures the essence of 1950’s style. Everything from the music of the era, the vernacular, black and white televisions, clothing style and the popular art decko style are alive and utilized in this game. Pair that with the dim lighting and the green haze from the windows that show off the sea, and you’ve got quite a vibe. Each level of Bioshock has a distinct feel to it, while upholding the overall theme of Rapture. I did get a little bored with the locations after a while, after the initial ‘wow factor’ of the aforementioned art style became less foreign. Rapture’s look is very much a one trick pony, but it’s a hell of a pony. \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Now that we’ve got past the visuals and atmosphere, it’s time to delve into the gameplay. The biggest thing that Bioshock prides itself on is it’s sandbox-like gameplay. Bioshock is very much a first-person shooter, but even calling it that is selling Bioshock very short. The big factor that makes Bioshock so different are the plasmids. These are abilities made for battle that were scientifically created in Rapture. There are about a dozen of these plasmid choices at your disposal, which allows for unique battle experiences for each player. You can freeze, electrify and incinerate enemy splicers. You can even launch a swarm of bees at enemies to disorient them, or use telekinesis to halt an incoming grenade or RPG missile and launch it the other way. Want to confuse splicers even more? Why not cast a dummy enemy somewhere to draw their attention away from you? How about enraging one of them to get them to attack each other? Or better yet, my personal favorite; getting a Big Daddy to protect you? Overwhelming? Yes, but that just goes to show you the countless options you have to killing who you need to kill. It goes far beyond the ‘cast lighting into a pool of water when a splicer is standing in it’ tactic that we already knew about. Like me, you’ll find your favorites, and you’ll stick to them. You can even upgrade these plasmids throughout the game. There’s even abilities you can attach to yourself to increase your health and EVE (think magic meter), along with countless other abilities that can make you more capable.  \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Here is one of my examples of how I played the game at a certain part. I came into a room which had a turret in the center, and immediately struck it with lightning to stun the machine temporarily. I then ran up and hacked it (which you can do for safes, security cameras, doors and vending stations) and had it programmed to kill splicers, instead of me. To the right of me, there was a room with it’s floor flooded with water, a security camera and a health station. I froze the camera and hacked it as well, which gave me the same result as the turret. I also hacked the health station, which lowered the price I’d have to pay to heal, as well as damaging any splicer who tries to heal at the same station. I went back into the turret room and went to the room just north, where I was met with a mini-boss battle and ample splicer enemies. I was outnumbered. I decided to cast a flame on one enemy, which made her run for water to put out the fire. She’ll be back for me. The other few splicers came after me. I ran out of the room and into the turret room, and they were shot at by my newly convinced friend. One of them died from it, but the other few shot the turret up until it exploded. Now I’m in a firefight with two splicers. Suddenly, I see the female splicer zip past us and into the room with the health station and hacked camera. She’s actually going in there to heal up! I run in there to follow her and to get away from the other two splicers, and I find her at the health station trying to heal. Instead, she takes another huge hit of damage, and I finally decide to take her out with one determined shotgun blast. Dead. I can hear the other two splicers yelling for me, and they came running into the room. There were two doors to this room, and they came into the one that the camera pans at. The alarm suddenly goes off, and a gunner bot bursts in the room and fires at the last splicers. And looky, they’re both standing in a puddle. Zap. Dead. This is Bioshock.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 All of this, paired with fully upgradable guns and weapons make this game incredibly deep. There are all kinds of different ammo types best suited for some enemies, along with all of the plasmid fun there is to have. I’d love to run through them all, but there’s not enough time. Don’t be fooled, it’s not just a ‘balls to the wall’ plasmid and firefight game. Bioshock pairs this thinking man action with survival-horror styled pacing. It’s a very methodical game. Often times I crept through some areas gingerly; halfway watching for sudden attacks and halfway exploring each area for items or story fragments.  \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Then, of course, there are the times when my path crossed with two of the central figures of Bioshock, the Big Daddies and Little Sisters. From a gameplay angle, Big Daddies serve as the “bosses” of the game. These towering behemoths scour the city of  at all times, commonly found protecting the Little Sisters. These Little Sisters search dead bodies for ADAM, a chemical-like substance that allows for all kinds of physical wonders and breakthroughs in Rapture. In your case, ADAM is what you need to score to boost your physical, technical and plasmid abilities. You’ll need to upgrade yourself in order to make it in this cut throat city, so you need to get that ADAM from those Little Sisters. Just one problem; you’ve got to take out the Big Daddy protecting her. These guys pose quite a challenge, so it’s imperative to be prepared when you’re ready to take one on. While these battles with the Big Daddies do pose an immense threat to you in the early goings of the game, it gets much easier as you make progress and acquire new weapons and plasmid abilities. It’s not as if killing them off becomes as easy as killing a lowly splicer, but with so many different tactics and options possible, it was easy to find slightly easier ways to take them out, and take their loot.  \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So, the Big Daddy is dead. Now, that twisted little sister who was shouting at her Big Daddy to kill you off is now at your feet. This is the part of Bioshock that presents the big moral dilemma. It seems like these moral choices are appearing as focal points in a lot of games these days. Trendy? Perhaps. Regardless, you have a decision to make. Rescuing a Little Sister will save her life, and restore her almost entirely back to a normal human being. The catch is, you’ll get less ADAM from doing so. Harvesting a Little Sister means you will essentially take her life, leaving only a strange larvae-like creature in your hands. She will be dead, however, you’ll score much more ADAM. Upgrading means everything, so what will you do?  \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You’ll have a pair of people pulling your arms in both directions in the game. One will preach on about how these girls aren’t considered “human” and that you shouldn’t think twice about harvesting them. The other will tell you that they can be saved and restored, and that the are still humans inside. Can this little girl who was just calling for my demise, with eyes glowing blood red, be normal? That’s up to you. The decision to save or harvest these Little Sisters will decide what kind of ending you’ll get in Bioshock, but the moral dilemma side of things won’t pull at your heartstrings as much as Ken Levigne wanted it to. In some ways, it nails it, but it also falls short. Speaking of short, perhaps the biggest complaint about Bioshock is it’s ending. The game itself will last you a good 15-20 hours. If you’re like me and love exploring and taking it all in, count on twenty. It’s just a shame that Bioshock is a great and satisfying experience, yet with a undesirably short ending. While both endings quickly wrap things up, and quite well, believe it or not, they should have made it much longer.  \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Other than the issue about the ending, a lot of these complaints about Bioshock are extremely minor, and hardly ever detract from the unbelievable experience that you’ll get from this game. Bioshock isn’t the perfect game that all of the media outlets are depicting it as, but it’s close, and that’s saying a lot. It is finally the game that can back up that trite saying of a game being a “living breathing world,” and is full of memorable moments that you create by how you play the game. It has an organic and ingenious storyline that will leave you satisfied, and a setting that is easily the new benchmark for all future games to strive for. This is an essential purchase for everyone, and is one of the best games I’ve played for this generation. ',\n",

I have pretty high standards for games, but the current state of the industry has shown us great games are possible regardless of budget or big name access. Which, in my mind, leaves no excuse for games that aren't absolutely great. That being said, Bad Company seemed too disposable. Yes, the destructable environment element is great, until you realize you can just hide behind a log that can't be blown away unlike the brick building you were just blown out of. A little balance here, please? The characters seemed a bit flat, although they do develop a bit after the gold element is introduced. I played about a quarter of the way through before GTA IV went back into the DVD tray.I should also note that I'm on an 'old school' CRT TV, not HD. But IMO, developers should compensate for that (I HATE not being able to read fuzzy text! Throw us college kids without rich parents a frickin bone here!)\",\n",

       "  'description': \"After 3, some wondered where the series would go from there. Not many expected it to go back in time. 3 was basically contemporary, but you didn't get that much of a feel for the setting or main character. That was probably Vice City's biggest contribution to the series. Instead of a nameless, voiceless criminal, you played Tommy Vercetti, a person with goals and opinions. It was refreshing to play someone who could think for himself and often took matters into his own hands instead of just taking orders. Sometimes he was still doing grunt work, but he was in charge of his own fate. Along with the character, the game's radio played a huge part in placing you in the world. Instead of some generic house and pop music, there was a variety of stations playing a bunch of real music from the 80's. It set the mood about as well as it's been done in a video game. The music, along with the general aesthetic of the city and people in it went a long way. I don't have that much nostalgic attachment to that decade, being three years old when it ended, but it still made the experience more entertaining. The talk radio wasn't quite as good as 3's Chatterbox, but there were two stations and they were both good.There were a lot of small gameplay tweaks and improvements that made the experience better. The addition of motorcycles might not sound that significant, but they were quite useful, and I still usually pick them over cars unless I know I'm going to be taking heavy damage. They're more maneuverable, allow you to fire straight ahead, and can be bailed from without injury. The only problem is that crashes can be pretty hazardous to your health, especially when you go flying over a railing and into the river, which Tommy still couldn't swim through. There were much better boats though, and helicopters and planes were a fun way to get around quickly. The variety of melee weapons instead of just the bat was cool, although it stifled the more dangerous part of your inventory quite a bit. There was more freedom progressing the story, too. You had to build up a criminal empire by taking over and improving various businesses like a club or marina, And it was cool buying up safehouses all over town. The story was more interesting than 3's, easy when your protagonist is so much deeper, and the missions featured more variety and complexity. My only problem with the gameplay was the design of the city itself. Part of the fun is always the car chases, either pursuing traitors or evading the cops, banking around tight turns and barreling down hills. There just weren't that many hills to be found. There were nice jumps sprinkled around, but it was all just a little flat in places. Still, it was a fine game that improved over 3 in almost every way.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'I really wanted to like this game; I did. Despite reading rather sub-par reviews, I decided to land $50 on this game and I felt disappointed with my purchase. This will appeal to Potter fans (like me), but not really anyone else. On the positive side, Hogwarts is rendered beautifully, even for the Wii, and it is all explorable. Unfortunately, this is why the game fails as well. The NPCs task you to run around the whole school dozens of time throughout the course of the game finding stupid items and doing middling tasks. The controls in this game are also unresponsive. Having both a Wii and 360, I chose to buy this version because of the promise of \"cool\" motion-control. Maybe I should have bought the Xbox version. Placing paintings on walls and moving cogs around in a clock are damn near stress and explicit inducing when moving the remotes a half-inch the wrong way sends the pieces flying across the room, being followed by a sometimes nausea-inducing camera that will spin in circles if you remote is moved a different way.\\xa0The control is just annoying and the gameplay is the same thing over and over again.

       "  'description': \"Uncharted drakes fortune is properly the best exclusive PS3 exclusive game yet. You are Nate Drake a modern day treasure hunter and are trying to hunt down the treasure of El Dorado. You start by finding Sir francis drake's coffin and find his diary. You end up on an island and your search starts there....Uncharted story is great as you progress through the game constant twists in the story keep you wanting for more. Is the treasure all that it seems.... The story is told by colourful cut scenes which work well and have great voice acting. Graphics - WOW. This game looks amazing. the jungles you are in look real with real colours, trees, leaves ground, sky there is even one bit where you see a sunset and I have never seen so good graphics on any game. 10/10 for graphics. The people are well textured and all look different from each other. A thing what did amaze me was when Nate goes in water he actually gets wet and you can clearly see it.Sound is great. Firstly the voice acting is good even if your enjoying it from cut scenes or just when wondering around. Another I loved in this game is the ramdom comments Nate makes during his adventure like 'What more, where do they keep coming from??' and 'Woah' and 'you have got to be kidding me' just things like that add to a game a great deal. You can hear all the usual jungle sounds and footsteps. The guns also sound good but could have been better.Gameplay. The gameplay is awsome and one of the best I have ever seen. Two main parts of it are puzzling and combat. Firstly puzzling. Way better then anything you have seen in tomb raider or anything like that. You can climb, jump and hand from a lot of objects and you have to find new ways round to reach different areas. secondly combat. The combat in uncharted is very unique. HUD is kept to a minemum with no health bar or rader which i guess is good and bad, however it works well. You can use almost anything as cover and shoot out at all the mercs after you. The AI is actually really good with them throwing grenades and flanking you if you stay in one area for too long.Uncharted is a game with great reply value. Once you complete it there are a whole bunch of reasons to play through it again. You may want to play it through again on a higher difficultly or to do things you didn't do the first time round. The reason i played it through agian and again is to get/unlock everything. There are 60 treasures to collect and medals and rewards to unlock which will keep you going for a while.Overall if you have a PS3 get this game, you can show it to your friends who have a 360 and go 'HA'. You won't be dissapointed. I think the only bad thing about this game is the gameplay is slightly uneven as it sort of goes: Combat, puzzling, conbat, puzzling, combat ect. and the game itslef could have been longer but other then that great!! \",\n",

       "  'description': \"With San Andreas, Rockstar full subscribed to the idea that bigger is better. The world is massive. It covers an entire state, containing not only three cities, each bigger than the ones in previous games, but also quite a lot of real estate in between, including forests, a desert, and many small towns. The soundtrack isn't as good as Vice City's, but still included a large variety of enjoyable music. They also improved the streaming technology, allowing you to go from anywhere outside to anywhere else without a single loading screen. It's quite an impressive feat, and really increases the scale of some of the bigger chases you can get into. There's a larger variety of vehicles you can use, including special ones like bicycles, tractors, and jetpacks, and there are many more indoor locations you can explore. The biggest gameplay change was the addition of a variety of role-playing elements, giving you full control over your character. CJ is always the same person in the story, but you can work out to make him buff or eat a lot to make him fat. There are several different clothes stores you can use to change your look (and how people react to you), and multiple girls you can befriend and date, giving you various bonuses for doing so. At the beginning, CJ is pretty bad at driving and shooting, but using the different kinds of vehicles and guns improves his performance with both.With so much to do, the game could have gotten too big for its own good, but fortunately it didn't. It does an excellent job of balancing everything and easing you into it, keeping you focused on one major issue at a time. What was interesting was the distinct feeling and atmosphere in each of the three cities. The take off of Los Angeles is where everything starts and ends, and is full of the gangland warfare prominent during the time period. A lot of people can't get into that, but I thought they pulled it off pretty well. Taking over territory was an interesting diversion (as long as you didn't do too much of it the first time around, since all of your progress gets erased), and some of the things that happen near the end, like a riot in the city, are handled pretty well. Even if you don't like that culture, there's some more traditional Grand Theft Auto stuff in the other cities, where you tend to deal with other sorts of criminals, like a blind Yakuza in the driving-focused fake San Francisco and Italian Mafia in their version of Las Vegas, which includes a really cool, optional casino subplot.CJ is a really well-rounded, likable character. He's not as independent as Tommy Vercetti, but he's a more sympathetic guy. The story follows him as he tries to help his family and rebuild his gang's status, while going after a pair of corrupt cops who have wronged him from the start. Some familiar faces show up, and the cinematics felt even more authentic once the developers learned they could get away with cussing. The missions are more elaborate than ever, and the game is filled with great moments, including countless spontaneous ones just screwing around with a friend in co-op. Some people complained that the RPG elements got in the way of the game, but that simply wasn't true, they almost always felt like an enjoyable addition, becoming a hassle on only a few small occasions. San Andreas was as big as it could get, but now it looks like Grand Theft Auto IV will be a more contained, tighter experience.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Batllefield Bad Company for the Xbox360 and PS3, takes everything that was great about the battlefield games and builds on them. Unlike most of the Batllefield games this one is for the console instead of the PC. The Batllefield series has put out tons of games but Bad Comapny is only the second one to be brought out to the consoles. For years gamers have been enjoying the huge maps, crazy size battles and the many classes that grace the battlefield series but after a while the game began to get a bit stale. WIth every new battlefield only have new maps and new weapons and not really changing the game much to show a noticable difference. Well Bad Company although at times seems alot like the origanal battlefield games when you look deep down yo9u can see the changes. SInglePlayer: Battlefield games in the past have never really been known for their singleplayer experience. Well actually the singleplayer was basically the multiplayer but with less players and bots. Well this time around the singleplayer is actually well improved due to the fact that...well.... there is a story this time around. The story follows four soliders of the Americian army and their adventure towards stealing gold from some well equiped mercenaires. Bad Company is a squad of solidiers that are all very strange and just don't seem to want to follow orders. You play as Preston Marlowe, a new recruit into Bad Company. You squad mates include Redford who is the leader of the group, Sweetwater who is the brains of the squad and finally Haggard who is the guy who would instead of talkiing blow things up. All in all the singleplayer will last a couple of hours and the story although not to great is still better then nothing. Main problem with the singleplayer campaign is it seems to easy due to the fact that you have a needle that at any time you can use which will restore your health to full and the recharge time seems a bit quick. Plus if you die you just revive very close to where you were just at and their is no real penalty so it does seem pretty easy. Also if your the kind of person who needs achievments well the achievements for beating levels on a certain difficulty do not stack so you will have to play through it on both normal and hard to get both of those achievements, but it does add replaybility. Multiplayer: If there is one thing the Battlefield series is known for its the multiplayer. If you have ever played a battlefield game then you will have fallen in love with conquest mode in which each team tries to lower their enemies team's tickets down to zero. Well this time around conquest is out and gold rush is in. In this game one side is on defense while the other is on offense. The team defending tries thier best to keep the enemy team from blowing up crates of gold. While the other team head to the enemies base and tries to destroy the crates by either planting charges on them and defending the charge till it blows or just plain shooting the crates till they run out of health. The team attacking has a certain amount of tickets which everytime someone on your team dies it goes down while the team defending has an unlimitied amount of tickets. When the team attacking destroys two of the crates the the defending team is pushed back to a new base with new crates while the team attack gets a new base (most of the time) and recieves more tickets. Its a pretty fun new game type and its nice to see the guys at EA change the gameplay a bit. Of course the class system is back with five classes, you have things like your support who can heal team mates, repair vehicheles and even call in mortar strikes. But then you also have the scout who uses a sniper rifle to kill his foes and can even call in missilies to destroy enemy vehicles. All the five classes play differently and its always a nice thing to change up the gameplay whenever you wish. Final Thoughts: Batllefield Bad company is a great way to introduce such a great game from the PC to the consoles. The singleplayer for once is great and tells a pretty funny and intresting story while also looking great. Although the graphics may not be crysis great there still not bad. SIngleplayer does seem a bit short at times and also seems way to easy but still a nice touch to have. Multiplayer is great as always although it would be nice to get conquest mode apon release instead of having it as DLC in the future. If your bored during the summer time, need a shooter to quench your thirst or just want some crazy multiplayer then this game is a definate great buy for you. \",\n",

       "  'description': 'There have been many great first person shooter games throughout time, but one particular generation, involving the Xbox, Gamecube, and Playstation 2, has had some of the greatest this world has ever seen. You may or may not remember a particular game called Halo which came around mid-November in 2001. Dubbed one of the greatest shooters of all time. One year later, Metroid Prime was released by Nintendo and Retro Studios. Without going into technicalities, it’s safe to say Metroid Prime is Nintendo’s Halo.The Metroid series if you don’t already know revolves around a female Bounty Hunter named Samus Aran. But she’s not your average female Bounty Hunter. She’s got a nifty little thing called her Power Suit. A gold and red, shiny, cyborg like outfit that surrounds her entire body. Also, in a Megaman like fashion, she has cannon like thing where her right hand should be. Anyhow in this particular encounter, Samus receives a distress signal from a planet called Tallon IV, which once was inhabited by the Chozo. An inhuman like species, who also created Samus’ power suit. Samus goes to the planet to explore what may or may not be happening…and then it’s all on you. Your first and only objectives…explore.Of course exploring is limited at the beginning, only because your Power Suit isn’t tricked out…yet. Samus’ Power Suit is much more capable then being shiny and looking cool. It also has the ability to maintain 5 different weapon types, 12 different power shots, 4 different visors, and morph ball capabilities. Samus’s main weapon is just the power beam. It’s your average beam that shoots tiny little circular energy balls. Then there are missiles, a more powerful, though limited, alternative. Samus will also gain access to the Wave Beam, an electric type beam which can stun enemies, an Ice Beam that can freeze enemies, and a Plasma Beam which can burn enemies to a crisp. All of these weapons will be able to charge up and will be able to be combined with missiles for some very cool attacks. Another cool feature of the Power Suit is its visors. These are different types of HUD’s that are used for different things. Your most used one is your battle visor. Basically your standard screen for shooting things. Then there’s your scan visor, which is used to scan certain things like enemies and computers to activate and deactivate things, as well as get information for research logs (these logs all add up to boost your completion percentage). You’ll start with these two visors, but will gain 2 more that really change the games feel, and look for that matter.One other important Power Suit is the Morph Ball function. It turns Samus into a very much smaller little ball. Though it doesn’t sound like much, the morph ball is capable of much more than just rolling into tiny crevices and slots. There are numerous upgrades for the morph ball, though your most basic is the morph ball bomb. A simpler, tinier, blue ball is dispersed and a small explosion follows. Simple, but there’s much more to it then just dropping them. The bombs can help damage your enemies, and can also make you (in morph ball mode) jump. And with precise timing, you can even pull off a double jump.Those are the 3 main functions of the power suit, but there’s much more to that Chozoic technology then the eye meets. And by that I mean you’ll be finding a few more goodies that will help you on your way to victory. However, sometimes you have to ask yourself something. “Well gee whiz, with all these nifty little features, wont the controls be horribly, horribly awkward, clunky, and uncomfortable?” Well the answer is simply, no! Even with all these functions, everything plays smooth and comfortable. For example, tap A, and you’ll shoot a healthy stream of fire. Hold A, and you’ll charge your shot. At the touch of a button, you’re shooting a missile, transforming into morph ball mode, dropping a bomb, changing visors, or weapon types, everything at the touch of a button! Though due to the Gamecube controllers’ right thumbstick absence, aiming feels a little bit more unnatural when pitted against a game such as Halo, which benefits from a double thumbstick layout. To aim in Metroid Prime you generally have to hold the R trigger, and then move the control stick to aim. Of course while aiming, you are unable to move. But, Nintendo has come up with a much simpler alternative to manual aiming. In most cases, you can simply hold the Left trigger down, and you’ll automatically lock on to enemies. Simple and comfortable.The Metroid series always has been renowned for its great graphics, and Metroid Prime doesn’t lose that tradition in any way, shape or form. Now a lot of Nintendo made games are often cartoon like or artistic in perspective. They for the most part don’t push hardware to its limits. However, Metroid Prime may be one of the few exceptions. It delivers some of the greatest graphics of its time. With realistic effects in absolute general. Especially when it comes to up close and personal encounters. For example, a burrower (one of the many creatures you’ll come across) will pop up from the ground and spit blue waste at you. But instead of this just dealing damage, your visor will actually be drenched in this blue liquid for the time being. Another realistic effect is if your running in a smoky area, your visor will (like in real life) fog up. There are many other realistic effects that change the look of things in your visor. And it’s these sorts of things that really make you feel like your actually there. It makes it seem like you are actually fighting off a horde of space pirates, or exploring the depths of the deep blue. Of course realistic visor effects don’t just make graphics great. The game just really looks fantastic. Samus’ power suit is a worthy mention. The times you get to see it in small or large cut scenes, it looks fantastic. It glistens and reacts to every speck of light or energy that may come near you. And the various customizations that happen to her suit all look and react phenomenally. And what would a game be without its great looking bad guys. You’ll encounter many unique looking enemies all with distinguishable features, though some of the enemies are recycled, but have a different feature or two. For example, Space Pirates are one sort of enemy that you’ll encounter on numerous occasions. And by god they do look fantastic in their own special way. However, in addition to Space Pirates, you’ll find Shadow Pirates, Flying Pirates, Aqua Pirates, and weapon specific pirates with a few special exterior features, which are usually colored stripes. But think of that as a bargaining point. In exchange for some linear baddies, you’ve got some mind blowing bosses. The bosses are tremendous in size, with excellent details and you’ll also find that they’re non linear. They all look different and are beautiful in their own hideous, appalling way. Sound and sound effects go hand in hand with graphics. There’s no speech in this game, at all. Hell, there’s not even one bit of dialogue in this game, but that doesn’t mean the sound fails. Metroid Prime’s key sound source is from the sound effects of things. Making up more then half of the sound category, are the various creatures and monsters you come across. As mentioned before there’s a decent amount of bad guy you’ll face. But not only do they look it, but they sound like they really mean business. All the different creatures have varied battle and attack cries, as well as their own unique death cries. Another hefty portion of the sound section, are the various sound effects. Samus herself has 4 different weapons which all have charging and missile capabilities. All of these provide a very unique and distinct blasting effect. These weapon effects added to the painful screams of your average bad guys are oh so satisfying.When you come across a game you want to play, you ask yourself whether it’s worth actually buying. Or if its one of those games that’s only good for a few days, otherwise known as a rental. Well, especially since its been about 5 years since its release, it’s definitely worth the full blown purchase. Considering you can now buy it anywhere from 5-20 dollars, it’s practically a steal. Metroid Prime will take average players about 15-20 hours. Add a few more hours if you’re going around Tallon IV collecting every single object, expansions and scanning every object there is to scan. To boot, after beating the game for a first time, you unlock hard mode which is definitely worth a shot as it the A.I. is considerably tougher and will push players even further. To add to the games worth, you can unlock 4 different image galleries, and if you own a copy of Metroid Fusion, a GBA, and a GBA-Gamecube cable, you can play the original Metroid on your Gamecube, and also unlock the Metroid fusion suit for Metroid Prime. So all in all you really are getting a great bang for your buck when you purchase Metroid Prime.Overall, Metroid Prime is just a phenomenal game. It delivers some of the best controls, gameplay, sound, and graphics the Gamecube has ever seen. It delivers some very realistic graphics and effects, a reasonable difficulty for everybody, and it delivers a great first person experience all around. It has just enough of that Halo sort of feel, and just enough of that classical exploration element that Nintendo knows how to deliver oh so well. Metroid Prime is definetly worth the purchase as is recommended for First Person Shooter lovers, or anybody looking for a game with a vast land ripe for exploring. ',\n",

       " {'deck': 'Halo 3 only dissapoints for part of the game.',\n",
       "  'description': 'Well, I loved Halo: Combat Evloved and hated Halo 2. So I wasn\\'t really expecting much from Halo 3, but it turned out to be a great game but it has its far share of problems and in my opinion this game isn\\'t even close to deserving a perfect score.When you first start up Halo 3 you should start off playing the Single-Player, for it has changed a great deal sense Halo 2. One of the changes include actually playing as the Master Cheif for 100% of the campagin this time around. The story takes place right where Halo 2 left off and never lets up from there. Intense shooting action is broken up between driving vehicles which control fantastically and ocasionally takeing out some Scarabs. The enemy A.I. is good, but not great. The Marines though are crap as ussual, not only do they die within about two seconds of encountering enemies they also spout out randam usless dialouge that tends to be very annoying. Give the Marine the wheel of a Warthog while you take the tourent, and you can you will die faster than you can say \\xa0\"Carmine.\" The levels are well desgined and set up in the Single-Player except for the level \"Cortana\" which nearly drove me insane trying to complete on Legendary with another friend. The main problem with it is the checkpoints don\\'t work, and that can be said for most of the game. You will complete a long action sequence, die, start at the begining only to get about half-way through to where you were before and get a checkpoint. Its rather annoying and frustrating at points but fortunatly this happens only a handful of times. The major problem I have with the Single-Player is the story just isn\\'t that great. (However the campagin is still a blast to play) Some of it feels rather rushed and in the end nothing is really explained too well and if you watch the Legendary Ending you are once again left with a cliffhanger. Skulls this time around are more fleshed out as you can turn them on, and in Meta games get extra multipliers for playing with them on. Another change here is you can get them on Normal and Hard dificulty levels. The campagin will take you about 8-12 or so hours to complete depending on the difficulty and for players who have played numerous shooters and know what they are doing, start playing the game on Hard. The game also has some new vehicles and weapons that are rather nice and you get to use different\\xa0\\xa0weapons more in the Single-Player than you did any other games, the weapon diversity here is great.\\xa0 Same with the vehicles, they are diversivied so one minute your driving a Warthog, the next a Wraith, and then the next momment a Brute Chopper.The multiplayer is where this game truely shines. Bungie took their \"Custom\" games one step further and pretty much turned you into a legal modder with all the options you have. Couple that with Forge in which you can make custom maps and with Fondry (a map in the Heroic Map Pack that is now free.) and the possibilities are endless. I\\'ve never had so much fun playing Halo Cart, Dodgeball, Cops and Robbers, and Infection with my friends. Maps have also been designed a lot better this time around, they are larger and more built for certian game types. Highground for example works better with one bomb, than it does Team Slayer, but it still works nice with it. In competitive play Bungie has Ranked, Social, Hadcore, DLC, and Double XP playlists. Hardcore is where you will find the MLG, and Team S.W.A.T. game variants, DLC is where it only cycles maps you have downloaded so you can actually play the three maps you payed $10 for. Double XP constantly changes from Infection, to 3-Ball, to Griffball where you gain Double XP by playing some not so standard Halo gametypes. The weapons are so much more ballanced in this game than Halo 2 its unbelieveable. Glitches are nowhere to be found and Bungie also included what they call the \"A**hole button.\" Simply press the Back button, scroll down to a gamertag and press the A button to instantly mute them with .02 seconds. You also have a File Share, in which you can upload pictures, gametypes, map variants and movies you recorded\\xa0in Theater.\\xa0 On top of that you can customize your Character\\'s armour online.Online you can also play the Single-Player campagin with up to three other friends, and you can do that offline too. My only complaint with Forge is manipulating the objects isn\\'t easy and can become frustrating. It would have been nice if Bungie would have included a 90* snapping feature in here to help take some of that frustration out.Graphics in this game aren\\'t that great. Infact it would have been better if Bungie would have just used the Source engine. The physics would have been better and the enviroments would actually look nice. The problem with Halo 3\\'s graphics is the cutseense look like Halo 2 graphics (no joke) and the textures ingame blur way to quickly. Explosions look last gen at best, and the AA in this game in HD seems as if it is broken. On top of that this game only runs at 640p istead of full 720p. Sound on the other hand is nice and rich. You can here other people shooting and driving in the background.Halo 3 is great game that you will deffinantly want to buy and it is a great buy. Unfortunately becuase of the HUGE hype sournding this game, people are going to be dissapointed that it isn\\'t a AAAAE title but only a AAA title. But if you can look past the hype this game is wounderful with some flaws that could have been easily avoided.',\n",

       " {'deck': \"Robert Ludlum's Bourne Conspiracy is the Perfect Rental Package!\",\n",
       "  'description': \"There are those games out there, where you can have two sides to the same coin when it comes to a reviewers view on a specific game. Let me explain, if you purchased The Bourne Conspiracy at full retail price theres a very good chance you'll feel totally let down by what the game offers. Yet if you rented it, you'll find that its a solid game that will scratch your gaming itch over a good weekend of gaming and leave you pretty pleased. Thats what Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Conspiracy is suited for, a good rental and for that its a surprisingly fun little game while the action lasts. Even though you can't help for feel it could have offered a\\xa0lot more.Based around the books written by Robert Ludlum, and mostly around the superb films featuring Matt Damon. The Bourne Conspiracy offers a bit of a mix and match experience with the story. Its clear that the developers expect fans of the books/films to buy or rent this game because the games story does leave some huge gaps here and there. Don't expect to come into The Bourne Conspiracy expecting to be told the full story of the film/book of the same name, because you'll be dissapointed. If you want to know the story read the fantasically written books or if your not a reader then catch the superb movies. Anyway where was I, I personally rented this game and glad I did. For full price its not worth the cash, though it offers a Single Player experience that'll last you a day or so and different difficulty levels. Generally the game feels a little lack on content, which is disapointing because you can't help but feel more could have been done with this game. Especially considering a lot of the gameplay features are done so solidly in a time when games based around movies are so garbage. In the game you play as Jason Bourne, not the Matt Damon character though. A totally different styled character whose voiced by a different voice actor. The story is a bit of everything and though the game skips things here and there you'll still feel the general flow of the story\\xa0within the experience on offer. Though I reconmend you watch the movies for a thicker meatier story. The story plays its part, its clear the story is just filling for the actual gameplay\\xa0and action\\xa0found within the Bourne Conspiracy.You'll do a little bit\\xa0of everything, from third person\\xa0over the shoulder shooting to driving around the snowy streets of paris like\\xa0the famous scene in the\\xa0film. Theres also a solid melee system that can generally\\xa0feel a little\\xa0repetitive but offers\\xa0enough variation\\xa0that its not\\xa0a huge deal.\\xa0\\xa0The Melee combat\\xa0features a system which allows you to perform special takedowns, these are hard hitting stylized attacked that are obtained once you reach a certain point in the Takedown graphic which sits\\xa0at the bottom right corner of your\\xa0screen and never really goes away, only in cutscenes. You\\xa0build up this graphic by attacking your enemy or blocking his attacked, its even possible to\\xa0perform a special triple takedown if you are surrounded and have enough takedown slots filled. All of the animated attacks are fantastic and very much in Bourne Style, they all have a somewhat realistic style to them much\\xa0like the quick attacks Bourne perform in the films and will make you shout 'Ouch, thats gotta hurt'' once you see them in action. It is also possible to do a gunfire takdown\\xa0if you have enough\\xa0in the takedown chart, this isn't as spectacular and for the most part is a timed\\xa0button sensitive one\\xa0hit kill system. Speaking of\\xa0Timed Button pressing, the game is full of them in different sections. Think God of War times 3. For the most part they are\\xa0fine to perform and usually end up with a spectacular styled cutscene. But they\\xa0eventually get\\xa0on your nerves a little in\\xa0later sections of the game, these are also found in the takedown system.\\xa0A large Part of the game requires\\xa0gunfire, which\\xa0works perfectly fine. A cover system is also found within and does its job most of the time without any real concern. Most flat\\xa0surfaces can be used for cover and thats what you'd expect from a good\\xa0Cover system. Gunfire controls are solid, tho occasionally they can be a little bit dodgy from time to time and when you go into Bourne Instict you get a bit of a auto target system kick in though it doesn't do a great deal as the Bourne Instinct doesn't last you long, its basically a sense Bourne as which helps you get around levels and can be very helpful from time to time. You can die surprisngly\\xa0easily\\xa0in the harder levels of differculty and cover will allow you to regenerate health,\\xa0but it will be in the middle of\\xa0gunfire \\xa0where you'll spend most of your time dieing on the hardest of levels. The\\xa0melee system isn't\\xa0peticularly hard, the harder levels simply mean that enemies take a few more kicks or punches to take down. Theres also\\xa0perfectly fine driving level in the game, as you drive through Paris. The controls are fine but are not at all realistic, also a small complaint is that in this game they drive the new Mini yet in the films Damon drives the old classic Mini..... but thats me being picky. Its solid at least, but nothing special and actually can feel like the games worst section as the gameplay is pretty basic and the graphics are poor. Speaking of graphics, for the most part its ok, nothing special here though there are sections that will still look fine. Its an average looking title but the graphics engine does it's job perfectly fine and won't get in the way of the game, it runs smoothly which is important in a game such as this. The games camera can be a bit half bothered and slow when in the 3rd Person camera but this is also something a lot of 3rd Person games seem to have nowadays. Voice acting is solid if unspectacular, not a great deal is said so not a great deal can be said about it.\\xa0Gunfire sounds nice and other sound effects also have a nice hardness to the sound.One aspect of The Bourne Conspiracy that is disapointing is the lack of a Multiplayer Mode, it might not seem a great idea at first but the melee system and 3rd person action could suit the Multiplayer battlefield well and I could see some sort of mode working, it would have added a great deal to the game and its sad that nothing is in there. There is a collection system in the disguise of simply picking up passports but its nothing special. Strangely one aspect of the game which saves it is Achievements. Unlike some games where getting achievements just isn't worth the time, its easy enough to collect some good achievements within The Bourne Conspiracy and for the most part there a lot of fun to get. OVERALL!As\\xa0a rental package, Robert Ludlum's Bourne Conspiracy is a solid fun, action orientated title that will last you a good weekend of gaming and will scratch your gaming itch. But as a full priced game, its poor value for money with a lack of modes and a short single player story. A definate rental choice.Gameplay: 8/10Graphics: 7/10Sound: 7/10Value: 3/10I Give Robert Ludlum's Bourne Conspiracy 3 Stars out of 5.\",\n",

However, Half-Life did change the face of gaming with the first successful use of squad tactics and AI, complete lack of cut scenes, One of the greatest and most confusing plotlines ever, and a completely silent protagonist (Gordon Freeman).The player takes control of Gordon right from the get go. The game begins on a tram ride that is on it's way into the Black Mesa Research Facility in New Mexico. Once Gordon arrives, he must don his HEV Mark IV hazard suit to prepare for a special experiment that, of course, goes horribly wrong and only gets worse. This is the beginning of the real game. The player must claw their way through the carnage and destruction that is now Black Mesa back to the surface to call for help.This game is a must have because it constantly delivers and still offers an amazing, memorable experience for today's gamers.

       "  'description': 'Everytime a GTA game is released we see this mass hysteria that almost goes as far as looting in the streets because people are just that excited about the game. And GTA 4 share the same name as its predeccesor\\'s that however does not mean its the same.  GTA 4 is a more dark and a bit more disturbed and serius version of GTA, to put it like this you wont be seeing any jetpacks in the game. This game is realistic, the city is realistic and everything makes you become emerged in the game.  The main character in this game is Niko Belic, he is a east european illigal immigrant, he arrives by boat hoping for a better life with his cousin. But of course things does not work out that way and Niko is sucked in to the Liberty City underworld and it gives you quite a glimpse of how horrible humanity can really be. If you think alot about it GTA is actually a pretty deep game emotionally it deals with Niko Belic as a human, he has his problem his past haunts him, and you end up really feeling bad for this guy which is rare in a videogame.  However not only Niko puts a really strong act, every other character in the game is memorable and some are funny, some are weird and some just seem very real.  The gameplay initself at its core havent changed that much since san andreas, you still do missions for crimelords and such, the biggest difference being that the cell phone plays a much bigger role this time around. You call people and tell them the job is done instead of running all the way back which is refreshing. But however the one bad thing about the missions is that some can feel a little repetetive, there are basically 3 core designs for a mission. which is Delivery, go to a place and kill everyone, drive after another guy or escape. Some of these mission does have that feel that you have done them before but fortunately not often so thats great.  The biggest improvement gameplaywise though is the gunplay you can cover against anything by a press off a button, the cover system is indeed not perfect and you will find yourself covering behind the wrong thing, but that happens very rarely.  There are also quite alot of sidejobs which will keep you busy after completing the main story, the sidejobs include being a cop killing criminals, delivering packages for little jacob, killing flying rats, go on dates, get to know your friends better. However, compared to San Andreas this game does not have nearly as much to do after the final mission, GTA 4 has basically concentrated more on realism and immersion this time around. Which is fine its bascially just different priorities, but its not all bad because the perhaps biggest news in GTA is the...  ...Multiplayer yes it is indeed true GTA has multiplayer, but it does not set the world on fire quite as you would think it would, first of the number one complaint I have is that the coop mission are to easy and way too few giving almost nothing but a tease, they are fun but its just to little. Deathmatch is deathmatch plain and simple however if the server has enabled on auto targeting the whole thing just seem to easy and is basically a game of who finds the other first. you also have free mode where in my opinion the whole GTA style comes forward, you basically just go with your friends and fool around, however playing with strangers this mode is pointless and it becomes a deathmatch basically.\\xa0 You also have streetracing which is fine, but GTA isnt the best car racer and there are better alternatives.  The sound of GTA is no longer Micheal Jackson on the radio and these huge stars one after another, Rockstar have now gone for more unknown bands some sound great others dont you will quickly find your favorite radio station and stick with it, there is basically something for everyone here. The voice acting is great, however gone is James Woods, Samuel Jackson and all those guys and in comes uknown voice actors which is fine because the fact that you hear celebrities talk you will think \"oh thats Samuel L. Jackson talking how neat\" instead of actually listening to what they say. And it doesnt matter anyways since the voice actors have done a stellar job, Nico, Roman, Brucie and Little Jacob all sound believeable and the voice actors make the characters come to life.  Now to the technical part this is where GTA really shines, it has extreme detail in the city and no loading which is awesome, the ragdoll physics are fun, and you will at some point of the game just throw yourself out of a moving car just to watch you roll down the road. The pedestrians are amazing there is almost never that you will meet two pedestrians that look alike there are that many models. The gunplay is satisfying the models react to where they get shot which is good, want to just unarm them? fine just shoot their arm. Want to keep them from running away? Pop a shot in the foot and he will fall over. The one complaint I do have about the tech is that the framerate will drop in a busy quarter of the city while driving fast with a car which is kind off annoying but not a big deal.  In conclusion GTA 4 is a amazing game no doubt about it, however some small things like slowdowns, and some radiostations you could do without, and the limited multiplayer which limits the replayability of the game drag the game down a bit not by much. And if you go in expecting San Andreas 2 only crazier you will be dissappointed, this is a more serious and realistic version of Rockstar\\'s amazing world, and its a must buy no matter what console you own.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Before I got my hands on this masterpiece of a title, my Xbox 360 randomly couldn’t read any of the disks I put into it, resulting in me having to send my 360 in for repairs. So while I waited, August 21st came around, and still, I had no 360. Finally, in late August, I got the 360 back with me, and I couldn’t have been happier. Right away, I went and picked up BioShock, because I knew that this game is going to be outstanding. So, not to my surprise, I beat BioShock, and it was absolutely amazing. The visuals are impressive, the story is original, and everything about it screams AAA. BioShock is a special game, no doubt about. We really haven’t had a good, solid AAA game for a while, and finally we get BioShock, and finally we get something to talk about. But BioShock does have issues, it’s not perfect in anyway, but it’s still amazing, and I still love it.\\xa0You start the game as a person inside of a plane, then suddenly, the everything starts shaking, and the title appears with the sound of the plane crashing down in the background. The next thing you know, you trying to get to the surface of the sea while seeing the plane sink in the water. You get to the top and everything is aflame. If you haven’t seen it before, it seems like it’s still a cut scene when you get to the surface, but actually, it’s the start of the game. Once you find a random lighthouse in the middle of the ocean, you go inside, and you eventually find yourself in a Bathysphere and sinking into the water. A small movie then starts playing with a voice ranting about America and Russia. He explains himself as Andrew Ryan, and he wanted to get away from all of the politics, so he made the impossible, he made: Rapture, a city under the sea.\\xa0Once you eventually get into Rapture, a man is waiting for there for the Bathysphere but suddenly gets attacked by a monster, but they’re actually just humans that have gone mad. They're called Splicers. Splicers are the main enemy in the game, and there are five different types: Thuggish, they carry objects like wrenches and pipes; Spider, who climb on walls and ceilings and throw hooks at you; Leadhead, who carry guns and shoot you with them; Houdini, who can disappear and reappear, and throw fireballs at you; and Nitro, who throw grenades and other explosive items at you. At the beginning of the game, you find mostly thuggish and Leadhead Splicers, but later you on you find more and more of them. Most Splicers are walking around talking to themselves, and when they see you, they start attacking you.\\xa0Anyways, the Splicer kills the man, and then suddenly starts attacking the Bathysphere, but suddenly leaves. In the Bathysphere, a walky-talky is there, and a man is calling out for you to pick it up. He explains himself as Atlas, and he will help you in Rapture. An example of this is right when you enter a hallway, a Splicer is getting attacked by a Security Bot controlled by Atlas. Eventually he explains that you’re the only one who can save his family inside of a submarine somewhere in Rapture. You must try to get there, save them, and get out of Rapture alive. More twists, turns, and events happen very often after you start, and end up being one of the best stories in a video game to date.\\xa0You also collect Audio Diaries around Rapture and they explain many details of certain people’s lives during the good, and sometimes bad, times of the under water city. You visit many places around Rapture, going from the Medical Pavilion, to the forest of Arcadia, to the Core of the city, where the power is generated. The game is generally a first person shooter, with a lot of Adventure elements mixed in. There are also many RPG elements around like upgrading your weapons, and using different plazmids and tonics. Plazmids are your secondary weapon, other than the main guns. You use the Left Bumper to switch your plazmid, and the left trigger to use them. The guns are used with the opposite buttons. Plazmids can arrange from Electricity, to Fire, to Telekinesis, there are many different types of plazmids to use, and they all have their own unique advantages and disadvantages. You also have a Health bar, and an Eve bar which you lose from using tonics.\\xa0There is also a very wide assortment of guns to chose from too. There’s the standard pistol, machine gun, and shotgun, but then there’s unique guns like the Chemical Thrower and Crossbow. There are also 3 types of ammunition for each gun, which you chose with the D-Pad. The different types of ammo do different things. For example, with the Chemical Thrower, one type sets the enemy on fire, one electrocutes them, and one type of ammo freezes the enemy. You can invent different types of ammo in a U-Invent machine by collecting items like Kerosene, Steel Screws, and Distilled Water. You can also invent other items like Tonics and Automatic Hack Tools.\\xa0Hacking is a main part of BioShock. Safes, Security Bots, Vending Machines and all sorts of other things can be hacked for an advantage of some sort. Hacking is done by rearranging different types of pipes to make one long pipe line from Point A to Point B. There might be an alarm or block in the way, and it will cause you to short circuit resulting in health loss, or an alarm. You can also use an Automatic Hack Tool, or buy out for a certain amount of money. Hacking a Vending Machine will allow you to buy certain items, and will cause other items to cost less. You can also hack First Aid Machines (which heal you), and it can make the cost less, and when an enemy tries to use it, it hurts them.\\xa0You also find a carmera later in the game, and taking pictures of enemies results in a research bonus like more damage, or being vulnerable to certain ammo types. You can research the different types of Splicers, but researching all five types of them can get tiring, especially when the bonuses aren't really that good. Plus, the two Big Daddy types, Rosie and Bouncer, can be researched aswell. Also Little Sisters, Turrets, Cameras, and Security Bots can also be researched. Collecting or buying film is the ammo of the camera, but if you buy all 100 before you get it, you probably will never run out.\\xa0You collect many things in BioShock like ammo, items for inventing, but the main thing you collect is money. Money can be used what money is used for everywhere: to buy things. But money is also used for other things like healing yourself and turning off the security alarm. Killing enemies, and searching items are pretty much the only way to make money in BioShock, and on the higher difficulties, money can be scarce, so use it wisely.\\xa0Tonics are the other RPG element that you can collect, buy, and invent in BioShock. You have 3 Tonic slots: Physical, Engineering, and Combat. When you find a tonic, you can put it in one of 6 slots. You don’t start off with 6 slots though, you start with 2, but you can buy more slots with Adam you collect from Little Sisters (I’ll get to that later). Physical Tonics are useful, they can make items like booze and candy make you regain health and eve. Engineering can make hacking easier with Tonics that make the juice flow slower, or the tonics can make the alarm have half the time to expire. Combat Tonics can up your overall defence, and make you take off more damage with your wrench.\\xa0Little Sisters, who can create Adam which is a necessity to complete the game, are little girls who are protected by their Guardians: the Big Daddies. The Big Daddies aren’t main bosses of the game though, there are other Spicer bosses you have to face instead. Big Daddies are very difficult to defeat if you don’t know what you’re doing. Defeating them though, is very worth it because you can Rescue or Harvest the Little Sister it was protecting. Harvesting the Little Sister gives you 160 Adam, but Rescuing them gives you 80 Adam. But after you rescue 3 Little Sister, you get a gift, which is a teddy bear sitting in front of the Gathering Garden (the place where you spend the Adam), and it always has another 200 Adam with other stuff like ammo and other things.\\xa0The visuals in BioShock aren’t groundbreaking like Gears of War or anything, but are still amazing either way. Every character model is smooth, and the environments are outstanding, and every little detail is amazing. Rapture looks exactly like it would if it was made in the 50’s, just like what time BioShock takes place in. Fire looks great too, and when you hit a puddle of oil, it sets on fire right away, and blows up the oils drums near it. The physics are great too. Picking up items with Telekinesis and throwing them is would be exactly the same as it would be like in real life. Plus, BioShock has little to no slow down, so when you’re in the heat of the battle, you don’t have to worry about the game slowing down or anything.\\xa0BioShock is very atmospheric by the way, and around every turn you never know what’s going to happen. You’re on your heels all through the game, and it never ends. The creepy music and sound effects in the background are top notch, and make you scared as hell where ever you go. The voice work is also AAA. Every Audio Diary, to every scream from a Splicer, everything is amazing. Voice work is always one of the best ways to tell the story of a game, and in BioShock, it works perfectly.\\xa0Overall, BioShock is an outstanding game. Whether you like first person shooters or not, this game is definitely the best game on the 360 yet, and should not be missed by anyone, even if you don’t own a 360. The atmosphere in this game is unbelievable, and Rapture looks like it could actually be a real place. Even playing it twice is good because of all of the missed achievements from the first play through. There are 50 achievements total, and they're all pretty much easy to collect except two or three. Basically, if you have a 360, buy this game, and if you don’t have a 360, shame on you.\\xa0\",\n",

       "  'description': \"\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Grand Theft Auto 4 is a definite benchmark in the series. It has not only moved up from the last generation of consoles to the current but has also done an equally important move up in the maturity of it's content. Now do not get me wrong, Grand Theft Auto has always been a very M for Mature ESRB Rated game (even went AO one but let's not talk about that). This time though the story is much more mature and at a much better quality (one could make a decent gangster movie out of this).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The great thing about Grand Theft Auto 4 is that the player could have a blast without ever really paying attention to the story. I find just going postal in the game sometimes to be incredible and therapeutic. The missions are the most interesting and varied in the franchise. Rockstar also cut most of those weird out-of-world missions that I never enjoyed in the first place (like the RC missions in San Andreas).\\xa0 The game keeps you for the most part focused on what makes the game great: the driving, the shooting, the searching.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The graphics in Grand Theft Auto 4 is not a new benchmark in the industry but they are still impressive in their own right. To give a game such an open-world and to have the scale and draw distance (for the world, not the characters and cars) can leave one jaw-dropped at times. The right cars look shiny and the other cars look dirty. There is a varied collection of character models that fill out the city. Everything looks right and that helps the player immerse themself fully into Liberty City and feel like they are Niko or atleast a connection to that character.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A feature that truly helps present Grand Theft Auto 4 as a benchmark in the franchise is the much overlooked online multiplayer mode. This is not some tacted on fragfest experience like in many other single-player focused games. The multiplayer is varied with your usual deathmatch, to a cops vs. robbers exxperence, to racing, to multiplayer missions. The game also gives the player the ability to join with three of his friends in Liberty City with the online co-op mode. There is definitly something for everyone in the multiplayer mode of Grand Theft Auto 4.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Grand Theft Auto 4 is the total package. The game contains an amazing story mode that lets you complete the game at your own pace with great graphics, world, characters, controls and gameplay. The multiplayer is surprisingly varied and fun with a feel you cannot find replicated on any other game on shelves today. All of these reasons are why I give Grand Theft Auto 4 a five out of five.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Rockstar has succeeded again in creating one of the biggest, most ambitious games ever, and managing to keep it fun in the meantime. With making the leap to the current generation of hardware, they had to step up the technology, as by now the PS2 games look ancient. They did so in a big way. There's slowdown in the more chaotic moments and some texture popping when you're driving quickly, but it's overall a good-looking, polished game. Faces sometimes look a bit weird, but the overall presentation is miles beyond previous installments. The radio is pretty solid, with good songs usually in reach even if you don't recognize them, and a few funny talk stations. The voice acting is generally at a very high level. Everyone with a real part does a decent job at the least, and the throwaway voices on the street are usually funny.The series always did a good job with the cutscenes besides a couple awkward moments, and they really shine here, with many scenes matching the quality of a good movie or television show. The story is good, with Niko being far from innocent but still a sympathetic character. The plots are always so long in these games that they tend to lack a real focus or arc, but most of the time he's working towards his goal in some way, if not directly then in hoping whoever he's working for can help him. This is the first GTA game to feature choices, as several times you decide whether someone lives or dies and make a big decision near the end that determines the ending. I wish these choices had more bearing on what happens in the story, but they do have gameplay consequences as well.The gameplay is improved, but there are still some issues, and the different sorts of missions you do have gotten pretty typical at this point. Sometimes you'll tail people, other times you'll chase them, other times you're running from cops, and quite often you're just shooting them up in a warehouse. It might just be selective memory, but I remember San Andreas being more creative with some of the bigger jobs. The driving has been changed in this game, as the handling is now much rougher than it used to be. It seems impossible to consistently get good corners. You get used to the new mechanics, but it's more of an understanding-your-limitations used to it than a actually-doing-it-well used to it. There are some cool things you can do with it, but it's hard. Thankfully, the shooting is much better. The auto-targeting still isn't great, but it's easier to aim freely and the ability to use cover makes shoot-outs an exercise in skill and not a crapshoot. It can get rough in tight areas, but you're usually better off than you used to be.There are lots of little side missions you can do as diversions, and the expansion of girlfriends more into the story makes things interesting. Not just ladies anymore, you can hang out with various people you meet in game, and go out and have fun with them. You can see Ricky Gervais or Katt Williams do standup, go bowling, or my personal favorite, go drinking. When drunk, characters will wobble around and fall over in hilarious ways, demonstrating the game's excellent body physics. One of the best additions to me honestly was how well people interact with explosives or quickly moving vehicles. It's like ragdoll physics except it doesn't look idiotic. Anyway, friends or girls that aren't introduced by the story confer special bonuses if they like you enough, like selling you weapons at a discount or providing a couple thugs for backup. Cruising with a buddy between missions and then getting his help when you need it really add to the game's immersion. It's the most complete GTA yet, it's just not as exciting an idea as it used to be. The multiplayer's a lot of fun too, as soaring down the highway and gunning down opponents is even more fun with a friend. I haven't spent much time with it, but I'll definitely play it more during the summer.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"There are few games that I have played that have had me captivated from the first time I picked up the controller and all the way through to the end. Those few games that have done this for me include Metal Gear Solid, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and this game...God Of War. From the first time that I took the blades of chaos and started becoming a killing machine I had a blast. And it was easy to pull off all the different moves. This is a game that anyone can learn, because you can either button mash your way through the game (although it makes it a bit tougher in my opinion) or you can take the time to learn all the different combos. Now there aren't a lot of different combos to learn. I personally think thats a great thing, because some games will have 50 + combos from the beginning for you to learn...for some that can be over whelming. But with GoW you start with a few simple combos and as the game progresses you can take the time to learn more.  Now not every move deals with the blades of chaos. There are several magic spells that you will be able to perform by the end of the game and even a sword that you can use. But for those of you who haven't played GoW yet, I will warn you, don't get too comfortable with these...there is a curveball in the game. As for the mechanics in GoW, I think they were executed perfectly. From double tapping X to do a double jump, to stringing together a combo for a finishing move, its all very easy to do. And to bring you farther into the game SCEA even went as far as to not make action that you perform just hitting X. Just like in Resident Evil 4 you will have to hit button combos or just simply keep tapping a button to perform everything you do in the game. And boy does everything you do look so beautiful! Every animation, every blade of grass, the various Greek monuments and scenery...its all made with fantastic detail. Of course the cut scenes look even better. But, they are not just all 5 or 10 min long videos, there is also still images or animated images incorporated in as well. This is by far one of the best looking Playstation 2 games ever! And the sound brings you even more into the game. The voice acting is done very well and is believable. And the musical score throughout the game would make the Star Wars Orchestra salivate.  This review barely even scratches the surface of what God Of War has to offer you. Besides playing the game once through in Hero mode you can go back and try you hands of God Mode...which is one of the hardest difficulties ever in gaming. And yes, if you want to unlock everything in the game you do have to pay God mode. Once again this is one of the greatest games that I have ever played and at least for me it has changed the way I look at the Action Adventure genre. Oh and if you need something else to convince you to play this game...its only $19.99.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"F.E.A.R. is the second franchise-creating first-person shooter developed by Monolith that took me longer to complete than it should have due to technical issues. Just like it was years before I finished No One Lives Forever, FEAR came out late in 2005 but I just beat it recently, after encountering numerous glitches and an issue with getting the game to reinstall. It didn't really sully my experience though, as once I started really playing it I ended up enjoying it quite a lot.FEAR's central, fairly risky idea is a mix of high intensity, visceral combat and moments of creepy, psychological horror. It's a balance that could easily be screwed up, but they handle it pretty well. Just when you get tired of the waves and waves of enemies, they might throw in some unnerving atmospheric stuff or an appearance by the little girl the story revolves around. At the time little girls in horror entertainment were becoming a cliché, but it works.The majority of the game though is fighting a ton of clone soldiers, and it's generally fun, with the levels designed in a way to allow their AI to move around and try to flank you instead of just staying in one place until you shoot them. They can be pretty tough, especially when they introduce some of the tougher enemies later on, but you have a lot of help from the ability to slow time, lots of equipment and health boosts littered everywhere, and getting to carry around up to 10 health packs anywhere you go. As it is the thing to do now, you can only carry three weapons at once. I don't feel like they handled this limit as well as other games, because I carried the same two around almost the entire time since they were usually a good combination, and I basically didn't use any automatic weapons for 80% of the game. The normal soldiers do get boring to fight once in a while, but there are some others to keep it fresh. I was disappointed by the lack of variety, with them going out of their way to prevent you from ever having allies during a fight and little deviation from the formula, but the formula was pretty good.The graphics are already not nearly as impressive as they were when the game was first released, but in context it's pretty nice looking and the effects actually affect gameplay, with smoke constantly obscuring either your or the enemy's line of sight. The voice acting is decent, the sound effects help pull you into every skirmish, and the music and ambient noises really help set the dark mood they're going for. I really like it when shooters avoid leaving the first-person point of view and still effectively convey the story, because it's a presentation style unique to video games that can be really effective when done right. It's a little contrived when you stumble upon laptops and voice mails that slowly enlighten the story details in a very planned, progressive order, but it doesn't hurt believability too much and is plenty entertaining. The plot builds in the standard way and culminates with the standard twist, but it's the standard for a reason. I really liked the epilogue, and since the real sequel disregards the events of the expansions developed by another company, I'll probably just wait until it comes out later this year to see what happens next.\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots',\n",
       "  'description': \"I've been enjoying my Playstation 3 since I got it, but some people insist MGS4 is the only game possibly worth getting the system for. It is one of the reasons I made the purchasing decision I did, and I'm glad I was finally able to play it.Over the years, the Metal Gear Solid story has grown and twisted itself out of control, and one of the main concerns going into this game was that Hideo Kojima and crew would be unable to wrap everything up in a satisfying way by the time it was over. There were so many questions and characters to resolve that they could have easily blown it, but they didn't. I still think the third game had the best story in the series, especially on an emotional level, but Guns of the Patriots brings everything together and answers nearly every burning question I have. They even did a good job bringing the third game's events in and integrating them, when it would have been easy to just ignore them since they happened forty or fifty years before the other games. I wasn't completely happy with everything that happened, some of the action cinemas might have been a little too out there, and I kind of wished some of the plot twists were a little crazier, but it's hard to be down on the way they ended the saga of Solid Snake.Unfortunately, the large plot issues they had to deal with caused some ramifications with the gameplay. The first two acts are amazing and easily the most fun I've ever had with the series. But after that, the story takes over quite often and the last few acts spend too much time explaining things and not letting you play. The game is still fun in those areas, but often breaks a little too far to the formula when I just wanted more of what I had already played. The new stuff is fun, and interesting playing through the first time, but I definitely think when I play again the first two acts will hold up much better. The success of the game hinges on the new controls, which are much friendlier to the average user while still feeling like a Metal Gear game. Everything feels smoother, and it's always fun to either sneak past difficult situations or face them, either quietly using the now-less-intimidating CQC techniques or the actually enjoyable shooting mechanics, especially with the plethora of weaponry available. There's a new system for acquiring guns, ammo, and upgrades, and it makes it a lot easier to blast your way through the game if you want to. The boss fights are still fun and often unique, especially the one at the climax of Act 4, but my favorite is again the one that encourages sniping from afar, which seems to be the best in every game that's had one. The main bosses seem pretty extraneous to the story, but fighting them can be an enjoyably creepy experience. I haven't played the online with the game but I played the beta a couple months back, and if it was any indication of the final experience, which it should be, it's a bit quirky but can be a very addicting, satisfying, team-based shooter.I would be lying if I didn't admit some of the enjoyment of the series came from it's amazing visual and audio prowess. The games have always been the best looking on their system, and this is no exception. The textures aren't the best I've seen, but the models, animation, effects, and direction of the cutscenes are incredible. The voice acting is usually good, except when they get a bit long winded and sound like they're reading from a script. The music is entertaining as always and the sound effects, regardless of whether the scene is calm or a huge battle, are terrific. One of the best looking and sounding games ever, to go along an extremely fun game and wrapping up one of the more enjoyable stories. Even if you don't like previous games in the series, you might enjoy this one just because of the friendly advances the controls have made. If you have access to it, play it.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Let me start by saying that this game is much better then last years dismal Madden 05. For starters, the soundtrack in this game is one of the greatest that I have seen. As for every other sound in the game, its about the same as last season. Same old announcers saying the same old things. And the same old grunts from the players on the field.  The graphics haven't really improved much and are actually starting to seem a little dated (at least on the PS2) but then again I've been looking at alot of next gen screens so there is not much out right now that impresses me much. Anyways, there are a few new animations on the field and EA seems to have ditched the camera angles that they used last year in-between plays for some high angle views.  The gameplay has improved over last year, but then again I thought the gameplay in 05 sucked. The controls are as tight as they could be and some additions that were added to the R stick are actually useful. Like being able to push up on the R stick when your the RB and plowing over a defender. Or as the QB you can press the Square button and then flick the R stick left, right, up, down to select and audible within the current package. Its really useful when you see the defense is going to blitz and you just switch over to a passing play without having to move any of your players.  And now for the vision cone. I know that most of you people seem to already hate the vision cone. But, I'm here to tell you. Its not bad at all. I personally like having to be looking at a reciever to make an accurate pass. Although there were some occasions when I had an open back off to the side of me and I just zipped a pass to him and he caught. It has really made my passing skills better. Since in the past I've had trouble with looking at my different recievers without realizing that they are triple teamed.  Some of you have said that the precission passing has been around for years. And you are right, this is one thing that I think EA has wasted good PR on. Besides that there are a few other good tweaks, like being able to shift the offensive line by pressing L1 and then moving the L stick or directional pad left, right, up, or down. This helps to defend againest the blitzing defense. Also the hit stick on defense is back and just as good as ever. And if I may say so a hell lot more responsive then that crap that was in NCAA 06.  The franchise mode is pretty much the same as last years. So, if you knew what you were doing in 05 you'll know what your doing in 06. As for the Superstar Mode...eh...its ok. But, I did get pretty bored with it pretty fast. On another note I do believe that the Superstar Mode is a good start. I believe with alot of work this could become a mode that will captivate me for more than two hours.   Overall I believe Madden 2006 is a good football game. It may not be as good as it could have been, but, to be honest with the Xbox 360 and PS3 coming I believe that Madden on the PS2 and Xbox will suffer like it did on the PSone. I just hope that three years from now, I'm not still playing Madden 06 on my PS3 to get my football fix.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'While big name developers constantly push hyped up releases such as Mass Effect, Halo 3, Super Mario Galaxy, and Call of Duty 4, there\\'s always the little developer that could, bringing out an unnoticed gem, one that happens to be better and more polished than some big name releases. In this case, the little developer that could is Bit Blot, and the gem is Aquaria, a game that can best be described as Ecco the Dolphin x Castlevania/Metroid. It\\'s one of those games that prove games can be art, and shows that no matter how big your development team, you can put out a polished, high quality product...... and in Aquaria\\'s case, that\\'s a grand total of two people. Yes, two people made this masterpiece of a game, but unless you did a quick bit of research, you never would have guessed. Tons of work clearly went into this game. It was in development for over two years, one person working on the art, and the other doing the music, coding, and design of the game, and frankly, it\\'s quite amazing to see what these two people put out.Aquaria is about Naija, an underwater creature who is in search of her family. She travels the massive ocean world of Aquaria, from dark caves and ancient ruins, to beautiful underwater paradises. Aquaria has a force that runs through it, the Verse, a rythmic pulse that be called something like the heartbeat of the waters. By singing, Naija can manipulate the Verse and change the waters around her, gain new abilities, and change forms. Along your adventure, you\\'ll meet a number of characters who help to move the surprisingly good and engaging story along. There are a few good twists along the way, and the dialogue is well written.As stated earlier, Aquaria can best be described as a cross between Ecco the Dolphin and Castlevania/Metroid. You\\'ll swim through an absolutely massive underwater world with many diverse, and beautiful looking underwater environments. You\\'ll come into contact with many different creatures, and explore the many different areas of the world of Aquaria. The same open ended \"Metroidvania\" style gameplay is present here. You\\'ll sometimes find yourself at a point you can\\'t pass, only to find some sort of ability or form later on in the game, and then return to that one spot, able to continue on and explore new waters, although compared to Metroid and Castlevania, these moments don\\'t really happen all too often, and more or less you\\'re able to explore much of the world from the start, once you\\'re done with the small tutorial.Moving around the world of Aquaria is as simple as clicking where you want to go. Hold down the mouse button, and Naija will swim, while you move a cursor around the screen and Naija will go there. In fact, the entire game is controlled by the mouse. You\\'ll use the left button to move around, the middle button to look around, and the right button to use each of Naija\\'s powers, or interact with plants and other sea-dwellers. The mouse only control-scheme works great, and navigation around Aquaria can be fun all in itself. The game also has the support for keyboard + mouse, and the Xbox 360 controller. Sometimes, it\\'s just fun to swim around and do nothing, which is helped by the great level design and great looking areas.A small problem, however, is that sometimes you\\'ll find yourself lost, and not know what to do. Sometimes, you\\'ll be fighting a boss, but you\\'ll also be fighting yourself, trying to figure out how in the world you actually hurt the damn thing.  Also, again, the world is huge, which means a few more save points could have been nice.Two of the main mechanics in the game are singing and cooking. Certain plants you\\'ll encounter are a certain colour. Singing the right note near them will cause them to release a nice item for you. Not unlike the Legend of Zelda series, you\\'ll also learn different songs as you play through your adventure. These songs either do simple things like give you a barrier, but the big thing here is that you\\'ll earn different forms, and by singing, you can transform into these forms. The forms will give you the ability to attack, swim through strong current, avoid danger from certain foes, squeeze through small spaces, and more. You\\'ll have to switch through the various forms to be able to pass some of the games challenges, such as fighting enemies, or solving puzzles, and to find new and secret areas in Aquaria. Some of the forms seem like they could have been a simple spell though, such as Light, which simply let\\'s you see in the darkness, minus the abilities you have in your normal form.Along your adventure, you\\'ll collect different ingredients, weather it be by interacting with plant\\'s and animals, or by defeating enemies. You can use these ingredients to cook different dishes, will will usually raise various things such as health, speed, or damage, and others that give you new abilities. You can learn new dishes by collecting them, or randomly cooking ingredients and hoping you get something out of it. Most dishes can be cooked anywhere, and require only two ingredients, while others require you to head to a kitchen, and use more ingredients.The main adventure is pretty long. You\\'re looking at about a 12 hour game, which is if you don\\'t explore the entire world and see what the rest of Aquaria has to offer. You can gain new abilities to help you on your quest, get objects to decorate your home, find recipes and ingredients, get pets to help you in fights, and more. Some things you find be entering certain areas of Aquaria will also unlock more ending cutscenes, providing more incentive to explore the vast underwater world. All of these things can be done by swimming through the massive world, bigger than anything you\\'ve seen in a Metroid or Castlevania game.If that isn\\'t enough, the game has a mode that allows you to create your own levels. You can place plants, creatures, and more across your levels, save them, and play them. The fact that it\\'s fun just to swim around the beautiful world of Aquaria makes me see a lot of people wasting time with this. For those who want to go the extra step, you can make mods for the games. Title screens, enemies, entire levels, tilesets, animation, graphics, sound, music, and more. You can completely customize the game to your liking, and even download mods and install them to try out ones made by other people. I myself haven\\'t done anything with modding because I don\\'t know much is anything at all about it, but those who are willing to invest some time here have a promising time waster.All of this is made all the better thanks to some excellent looking visuals. The underwater world is brought to life thanks to some well done, well animated 2D. The creatures of Aquaria are also plentiful and diverse, all the plants, animals, characters, and enemies you\\'ll encounter are animated well, and look great. The diversity of the underwater areas are also great. Each area of Aquaria has a distinct theme to it, and the backgrounds and colours are all usually nice and colourful. Little visual touches such as bubbles, current, and the plants flowing steadily in the water make things all the nicer.The excellent visuals are backed by a superb soundtrack. The music is nice and relaxed, and fits the whole underwater theme of the game excellently. The game contains over 50 tracks, and all are pleasant to listen to, and some are simply beautiful. In other words, I want a soundtrack. The game\\'s story is also told through Naija\\'s point of view, by means off well acted voice overs. Never will you think the voice acting is bad or out of place.It\\'s amazing to what Bit Blot has done here. This two man development team has truly put out something special. This is the kind of game that could easily be a success on downloadable game service such as Xbox Live Arcade or WiiWare. The fact that they say sales are going well for an Indie game, that they think they\\'ll be able to continue developing games, and that they have some new ideas, only make me more excited for the next project that could come out of this two man team.',\n",

       "  'description': 'The Sony PlayStation is a great system, it can produce some pretty good graphics while also maintaining smooth and fun gameplay. Though the Castlevania games have always played great (excluding Simon’s Quest) and looked great at the same time, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night keeps the tried-and-true formula that made past game before it stand out, but created something more than just a great sequel. No, Konami not only evolved the series and threw it in unexplored territory, but they simply made one of the greatest games ever made. Sure, Symphony of the Night is a 2D platformer made on a system that can play three dimensions, but it takes the sharp platforming and combat from previous games like Super Castlevania IV, and perfected it. Not only can you still go left to right, battling enemies in your way, the next area is not always to the right of you, it can be down, maybe left, and sometimes up. It’s not like the previous game never had this, but the way Symphony of the Night lays it out is absolutely genius, and works incredibly well.But before we get too deep into the game, let’s get what the game is about out of the way first. If you’ve played a Castlevania before, you know exactly what to expect from Symphony of the Night: you play as a Dracula hunter that needs to take down his nemesis before Dracula does something incredibly evil. Instead of playing as the famous Belmont family, you’re put into the shoes of Alucard (fought beside Trevor Belmont in Castlevania III), the son of Count Dracula awakened from an eternal sleep and must enter the Castle of Dracula found by a women named Maria Renard, that only appears once every century. The game begins at the end of Castlevania: Bloodlines where you briefly play as a Richter Belmont taking down Dracula once and for all, but 4 years after Dracula was killed, Richter Belmont suddenly disappeared, and was never seen again.Alucard plays much differently than the Belmont family did. Instead of using the trusty whip, and upgrading it, Alucard can find a bunch of different swords and other weapons like maces to kill his enemies with. You can also equip to small weapons at a time, but if one weapon requires two hands, you have to only equip one instead of two. Alucard can also use magic spells by hitting a certain combination of buttons and directions that can hurt enemies and bosses even more. The variety of different weapons is awesome, and the addition to the magic also comes in handy in messy situations. Alucard also has a health bar that goes down when hit, and he also possesses a magic gauge that will heal by collecting hearts from killing enemies or breaking items like lamps. Thankfully the game has many save-points where you can both save, and heal Alucard of his wounds. The save-points are easily found on the map, so if you can’t find one, map the shit up.The map system is what made the gameplay evolve from what it previously was, and stood out as a great and almost needed element. Pressing R2 will bring up the map for you to see where you ca go next. The map is divided into a bunch of smaller rooms, and will be outlined by a white line, if the line disappears, then you’ll know that’s door that you need to go through. The map will open up more where ever you go, so even if you’re in the same room, you have to keep going through it to complete more of the map. Symphony of the Night’s map is always needed because the game isn’t linear in a Mario Bros. or Sonic style of way. Yeah, you have to fight bosses, get items and such in a certain order, the way of getting there is up to you. There’s still a lot of platforming involved, more than previous game in fact. If you want to get to the top of this room, you can just fly up, you can have to jump on a platform, then jump on the next one, and so on.Getting to the different parts of the map is also done with many different kind of power-ups you gain throughout the adventure. Some will have you turned into an animal like a Wolf or a Bat that can either jump across long distances, or fly across a room dodging enemies, and getting to otherwise impossible areas. Alucard can also transform into other things like Mist for example, that let him seep through almost impossible walls and structures. You also get the ability to use a double-jump technique that will get you to higher places that you just couldn’t reach before.The enemies are also pretty difficult in some situations, but are well designed overall. Enemies will be seemingly everywhere, starting with easy-to-kill Zombies that die in one hit with any kind of weapon, then progressively getting more difficult like the Ball and Chain Soldiers, and other sword based enemies. Alucard can kill enemies pretty easily, just hit them continuously with a weapon while dodging their own attacks, and they will eventually perish. The variety of the enemies is pretty good too, you will see enemies in different areas of the castle, but it will be satisfying enough. Near the end of the game you will fight very hard enemies though, and you will be put the test with frustration and dismay.Symphony of the Night also has some pretty epic boss battles to boot. Not only do they look fantastic while fighting them, but they also have good strategies to them as well. Some will have you dodging more than attacks, and some you have to figure out a battle pattern before going in and attacking. They’re also not a walk in the park, you will be put to the freaking test in SOTN with these bosses they throw at you. And speaking of the difficulty, Symphony of the Night, like most Castlevania games, is a perplexing game. You may not die several times, but you will be close to dying for half of your time playing it.Visually, Symphony of the Night isn’t anything be in awe over, but the mix of 2D sprite based character models and level designs with great, but minor, 3D effects looks pretty good overall. For the PlayStation, Symphony of the Night did impress, but with games near the release of SOTN having all 3D models mixed in with amazing effects make SOTN stand out as a good effort, but lacks in many ways. Still, the game is very easy on the eyes and doesn’t look smudgy and ugly like lots of PS1 games do. The animations of the sprites from Alucard to the enemies all work fantastic. There isn’t any slowdown of the frame rate, even with many enemies in the vicinity, so it plays very well. The load times when going to different rooms of the castle are good, but the load times while saving and starting up the game are quite long.\\xa0While talking to certain people, the screen with fill with the character talking with they’re text below it, and the art of the characters are pretty awesome. The game sounds pretty well in the audio department with full voice acting and awesome sound effects, but you still want be in total shock of it. The music on the other hand is very good, and you will be in awe of it. The music always suits the mood perfect and doesn’t get annoying in any instances. Some areas of the game certainly sound good, but are easily some of the best composed music of all time (in a video game).\\xa0Overall, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night might not be a total beast of a game with the graphics and the sound effects being good, but not amazing. But the gameplay is just so amazingly paced with the free roam ability to go anywhere you want while equipping any weapons you want. Symphony of the Night is one the best titles on the PlayStation, and is one of the best titles of the generation that shouldn’t be missed by anyone. Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network have this title downloadable, so if you own one of these machines, I suggest picking it up because it is pretty rad.',\n",

       "  'description': 'The dual screens of Nintendo\\'s handheld have been used for many things; displaying a map, inventory, statistics, menus, extra buttons, drawing, mini games, main control, extending the screen etc.. Enter Chronos Twins, an interesting DS game that make a truly unique, mind numbing use of the DS\\' dual screens. And there\\'s no touching involved either.Chronos Twins originally began as a GBA game, and it shows in it\\'s graphics. Nothing technically impressive for the DS, and decent for the GBA, and it\\'s all done in a pretty generic sci-fi style. Some elements of backdrops also seem to be taken from some Capcom games. The colours are good and bright, however, and the soundtrack has some pretty nice tunes in there, although nothing is too memorable.The story is simple, the planet is under attack by an evil alien called Twime, which can exist in two times at once, making it quite the hassle to get rid of. Eventually, a group of people build a dual time machine, which allows you to be in two times at once. They pick a soldier to head out and destroy Twime, and wouldn\\'t you know it? You\\'re that soldier. The translation isn\\'t the best thing ever, and the font itself flat out sucks, but it\\'s no Zero Wing.When you actually start to play the game, you\\'ll wonder how in the world they were thinking of getting this game to work on the single screen of the GBA. The story sets up for the unique gameplay mechanic that separates Chronos Twins from other games on the system. You\\'ll control your one soldier, in two times, at the same time. The top screen displays the present time, and the bottom screen displays the past. You\\'ll use the D-Pad to move around, and the face buttons to jump and shoot. Pressing the D-Pad to move and pressing the jump button will cause you to preform the action on both screens at the same time. Shooting, however, is handled separately between times, and you can\\'t shoot in both times at the same time. One button will shoot on the top screen, while one button will shoot on the bottom screen.This all sounds somewhat simple at first, but the real kicker is that level designs differ on each screen. On the top screen, there could be a ledge with no way across, while on the bottom screen, a nice set of blocks is in place for you to jump your way across. Of course, you\\'d be hesitant to make that jump, because logically, you\\'d die on the top screen... or maybe not. As long as you are standing on something in one screen, you\\'ll be standing on the other screen, weather you\\'re in the air or not, so you can safely make your way across seemingly dangerous terrain on one screen, as long as the other screen has a way across.There\\'s also a time freeze aspect. You\\'ll be able to \"split time\" so you\\'re only controlling one time. This is used in some puzzles, such as pushing a block so it\\'s in the right spot in both times. It\\'s also used to get certain powerups because there may be no way to get around in one time, but a nice little gap to go through in another.The game demands good hand eye co-ordination and reflexes, as enemies may be on one screen, and you\\'ll have to make a tricky timed jump on the other, but you\\'re in danger of landing on that one enemy on the other screen. Or maybe you\\'re running from an enemy on one screen, while avoiding fireballs and shooting enemies on your way along both screens, quickly looking back and forth to see what jumps you have to make. A warning siren and notice flashes when there is danger nearby on one of the screens. At first, it doesn\\'t sound like much, but it can be something of a waking call if you\\'re not paying attention.It all sounds hard and confusing, and that\\'s because it is. Concentrating on both screens is no easy task, and it takes a while to get used to it. If this game had to be compared to another game on the DS difficulty wise, it would be Contra 4, except that Chronos Twins is difficult for different reasons. While Contra simply throws rediculous amounts bullets and foes at you from all directions, Chronos Twins has some downright evil challenges thanks to the dual screen aspect of the game.The level design is good though, and combined with the dual screen aspect, provide some good challenges not seen anywhere else on the DS. There are fifteen levels in the game, and all are devilishly challengingThere\\'s a checkpoint system in the game. Every once in a while you\\'ll pass a checkpoint. Die, you\\'ll restart at the checkpoint. Loose all your lives, and you\\'ll restart at the beginning of the level. You can take a total of three hits across the past and present before you die, and you only have three lives. The game saves progress when you beat a level, but the problem is you never really know when you actually beat a level, because there is no indication whatsoever that you\\'ve actually gone on to the next level, or if it\\'s a continuation of a level you just beat. Another small annoyance is that whenever you\\'re hit by an enemy, the game will stop for about a second or two, and then continue on.Apart from the main game, there isn\\'t much else to do. You can play again, but it doesn\\'t keep track of any kind of records. There\\'s a lot of challenge to be had here, so if you like a hard game, you\\'ll probably like this one. It pushes concentration and reflexes more than many other games in the genre, and can at time frustrate, but if enjoy a good challenge, and take the time out to get used to the dual screen mechanic, you\\'ll find Chronos Twins rewarding, as it\\'s truly one of the best uses of the DS\\' dual screens yet. It just needs a bit more fleshing out.Chronos Twins plays old school, but it\\'s a game that can only be done right on the DS, and I\\'d love to see the developers make another game like this ground up for the DS.',\n",

       "  'description': \"You play a black ops soldier called Jack Kellar, and he is a 'rogue' and a 'maverick' who doesn't follow orders but gets results .Anyway, the cutscenes are filmed, and it shows Kellar being grilled by a government agent to explain his actions over the previous four days, where a mission to stop a terrorist called Lennox got completely botched.  What follows is eight levels of intense gun play, across a variety of locations such as a woodland border checkpoint, a graveyard, a huge fortified bridge and a dockyard. The levels are generally pretty well designed, and although they are totally linear the action is well directed, and you certainly shouldn't find yourself getting bored. The course of progress is rarely any more in depth than following the strict path to the level's end, but sometimes you'll have to destroy a door or some sort of daunting barrier blocking your path . There's also the obligatory planting explosives on certain machinery to scupper the terrorists' plans. Not particularly inspired, but never less than entertaining.  Graphically, Black is an outstanding effort on the ol' PS2, and despite a few rough edges is one of the very best looking games on the console. The weapon models in particular are excellent and include an almost fanatical level of detail. It is also brimming with lots of gorgeous special effects, such as dusty lighting , overblown explosions and a very nice out-of-focus effect. The only criticism I would raise is that some of the floor textures have a tendency to waver and stutter, which does tarnish an otherwise visually storming game. Criterion has really thrown the development manual at the PS2, and managed to achieve almost unprecedented visuals from technically ancient hardware. In terms of audio, it is also a very strong performance. The soundtrack is pretty much action-movie quality. Usually during the levels there is no music, but it often kicks in when either the level is reaching a climax or a particularly intense action sequence is beginning. The sound effects are awesome - gunshots and explosions sound very authentic and this is one game which really needs to be played with the sound turned all the way up to eleven to appreciate it.  There is some noticeable character AI, and it's not half bad, as these things go. Enemies have a commendable knack of finding cover , and if they see you from a distance, often they'll discretely try to close to within firing range - even if this means following you up a couple of flights in a building. It's not on the same level as, say, Halo or Half-Life, but is pretty decent all the same. Unfortunately the enemy designs are not quite so interesting - for almost the entire game you'll be shooting against masked goons, often from a medium to long range, and their design never differs from the camouflage outfit replete with balaclava and/or helmet. Differing weapons and riot shields is about all there is to separate them, and it does get a bit tiring shooting the same 2000-plus character models for the entire game. For part of the first level then the third level onwards, you'll also be in the company of one or two fellow US soldiers for pretty much the rest of the game. Their role is - as always - to basically follow you and provide covering fire while you do all the work. They hang back and aren't really useful enough in my opinion, but nevertheless it's nice to have a bit of companionship, and they are far less irritating than comparative squad-mates in Killzone.  If you were up to speed with all the pre-release hype and marketing surrounding Black, you may know it was touted to have all sorts of revolutionary environmental destruction, much like Red Faction similarly boasted several years ago. It's very impressive from a visual standpoint, but to be honest rarely means anything significant to the gameplay, and is a bit of a white lie given that it's only very specific buildings or structures that can be damaged. Controlling Kellar is pretty hassle-free thanks to some responsive and fluid controls, and you'll probably not struggle at all due to the DualShock . Kellar moves at an appropriate pace and the default aim sensitivity is pretty reliable, both of which are pretty important for me in a FPS. Naturally, in this post-Halo world of games, you can only carry two weapons at any one time and grenades are thrown instantly via a quick press of R2. There's also the obligatory melee attack, and you can carry up to three medkits (unless you play on Hard mode, where you can't carry any) which are accessed at any time by pressing down on the D-pad. All in all the controls are as good as you could ask for, and as intuitive as pretty much any other console shooter out there. Thankfully, one aspect not lifted from Halo is the regenerating health system. Although I appreciate video games don't tend to be especially realistic, I still have a dislike for games which give you recharging health without plausible justification. Here you'll find the portable larger medkits scattered around the place, and some enemies drop small white medkits when they die. It helps keep the game moving and is actually a pretty balanced health system.  The weapon selection is pretty extensive and is entirely real-world weapons, all modelled in immaculate detail. All the usual suspects are here such as the Glock 17 pistol, an Uzi, the AK47 or M16 assault rifles, the M79 grenade launcher and the rocket launcher. They all sound hugely dangerous and somehow it's pretty satisfying in a gunfight when you are expertly handling weapons like this. I'd also like to point out that a lot of artistic licence has been taken with the guns, namely that most automatic weapons have a clip of 60 to 90 rounds - which is great in game terms, but obviously not all that realistic. Still, you won't question the matter when you're in a firefight against four enemies, and that large clip saves you from having to do a potentially fatal reload. On weapons where the option is available, you can also switch between semi-auto, burst fire or fully automatic fire mode, which is a nice touch. My only real issue with the weapon lineup is that I feel that a lot of the machine guns are too similar, and because the choice tends to be so extensive it immediately renders a lot of the arsenal obsolete - you'd have to be a fool to favour a pistol over, say, an Uzi or MAC-10 Elite, especially given that these two can be silenced, just as the smaller firearms can. Like Cold Winter, although it's great having a big weapons lineup I feel it could've done with more balancing and tweaking, as the odds swing hugely in favour of just a few weapons as it is.  Given the high quality of the sound and music, it's a shame that the speech can't help bring things down a little. For a start, the game is littered with profanities which sound rather forced and as though they are simply there for shock value . Also, the actual delivery of the script is suspect at times. For example, at the beginning of the second mission Kellar is trying to sneak across the border, yet he is literally shouting over his radio to relay his position and strategy of approach. The voice acting isn't bad, as such, but it just lacks sublety, which seems something of a recurring theme as far as this game is concerned.  A big problem is that with a game as action-packed as this it's only a while before it starts to become slightly tiresome and repetitive. Entertaining as it can be, because of the intense, concentrated action, I think it's a good idea to play it one level at time, and try to space it out over a week or so. The problem is compounded by some questionable checkpoint spacing, whereby there's only one checkpoint per level - usually about halfway through - but due to the length of some levels you will be playing up to 30 or 40 minutes at times without passing the checkpoint. As I'm sure you can understand, this can be very annoying if you keep dying and you have to replay the entire level. Whilst I felt the Normal difficulty was generally pretty well-balanced , the game has a horrible tendency to unleash a couple of RPG troops on you when it wants to make things tricky. They tend to be high up buildings and are generally very elusive - the only clue often being the ominous smoke trail of the projectile. I felt this was a little unfair and smacked of a quick, lazy way to ramp up the difficulty. Also, Kellar cannot jump, and Criterion have taken advantage of this by putting in small steps - I mean literally about two feet tall at points - to prevent you backtracking through the levels. I'm not sure why this decision was made and I appreciate it's a really small issue to gripe about, but being unable to backtrack or explore at will because your stupid character cannot climb something a bloody hamster could mount is pretty annoying, and somewhat implausible.  Furthermore, it's a shame that the game doesn't last a bit longer. You will probably see the ending after six or eight hours' gametime , although possibly longer than that 'off the record' if you keep dying and having to restart. I think it's a bit of a shame that there's not a bit more variety to it - there's the one stealth level, but it's actually easier to simply run and gun your enemies, rather than creep around and unsuccessfully try to avoid being seen. The option to perhaps drive a vehicle , or some non-linear levels set in wide-open spaces could work wonders for the pacing and variety here, but I have to clarify that I'm not suggesting that Black isn't fun as it is - just that a little more variety would only be a good thing.  Strangely for a big-budget, high profile FPS, there is no multiplayer whatsoever. No split-screen, no online; nothing. While this doesn't particularly bother me personally (I'm mostly a lone gamer) I appreciate that it's something of a missed opportunity to extend the game's lifespan several-fold. They did claim that this was done to put more time and resources into creating an outstanding single-player game, but it's something of an oversight regardless. Technically things are pretty good. The surround sound is excellent, and really put to full use. The frame rate is pretty stable, with occasional dips when things get really heated, but nothing that mars the game too much. You can also mess around with environmental physics which works well enough  Overall, Black is a good game. It has absolutely superb audiovisual presentation, extravagant and hugely entertaining action and some of the best FPS set-pieces you'll find on the PS2. It's a shame the experience doesn't deliver a little more variety and there are a few minor flaws which bring things down a little, but all in all this is one of the most explosive, entertaining shooters on the PS2. Well worth your time.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'The Legend of Zelda has stood the test of time, and continues to be on the greatest games ever to come to a gaming console. The Legend of Zelda is a perfect game and that is with no doubt. The Legend of Zelda started off on the NES and was a huge immersing world even without the 3-D realm. But now Nintendo has expanded the game and the legend into a game that cannot be surpassed by anyone else. The game begins with a boy dreaming in a small room. He then is awoken by a small fairy name Navi. The young boy is no other then Link, and he is about to embark on a journey that will lead him across the lands of Hyrule and across time itself. His ultimate goal is to help Zelda defeat the man of Evil, Ganondorf.The Legend of Zelda is an immerse world that will have you doing many things. The game requires you to think and judge yourself on what you do. The game offers many side quest and things to do to increase your hearts or rupee bag. Any way you look at Ocarina of Time offers so much to do, and it even has the massive story line that you need to complete in order to save Hyrule.The game was released in 1998. For being at that time this game is one of the first 3-D games that controlled well and has nothing wrong with it. The game has several controls to control you weapons, zoom, and to move around. All are done perfectly. The control scheme in this game has no faults and would be hard to find any. You could not get away with out telling about the story of this game. The story is deep and compelling. The Legend of Zelda has the best story ever written for a game or anything ever written. There are numbers of monsters and beast to fight in Hyrule each with its own attacks and power. Link himself can get new weapons and upgrade several of them by getting stronger weapons of the type. The Ocarina of Time has the Water Temple in it also, known to be the hardest dungeon to man. If you get stuck there, go out and explore the lands and upgrade your life or start a new temple. The weapons in this game are weapons seen in Zelda games in the past, but are used in news ways compared to the original Zelda games. Adult Link has his weapons and Young Link has his, while you his as a child. If you didn’t get the title of the game time plays an important role in the game. In the temple of time is the chamber where the Master Sword is kept. The Master Sword acts a key to time. If you remove the sword you will be sent seven years into the future, and if you put the sword back you will be sent back seven years in the past as Young Link. Several times you will have to travel between times to affect things that blocking your way as an adult. So you will be required to travel seven years back to change what is in the future.Wow, the graphics. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time has beautiful graphics. This game continues to be the focus of what Zelda fans want Link to look like. The game has several effects that can be seen from parts of the game, like Death Mountains smoke effect. The clouds in the sky move, the sun makes reflections and moves as the day passes along. The music is amazing, every beat is not off a tune and has the mysterious beat to it. Every sound to Link’s yells, rain, monsters, and your ocarina are perfect.Basically, if you appreciate the Zelda series, you will fall in love with this game. Ocarina of Time is the best game ever to be released and will always be remembered as the legend that took the series to a new level and really brought the gaming world into 3D gaming and should that it could be done.',\n",

       "  'description': 'There are just not enough games like Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion these days. If you play this game for just one hour, then you will be amazed at the detail and complexity of the experience. This is one of those \"effort games\" where it seems that the developers spent thousands of hours and tons of energy into making it. Effort is one thing, but does it directly relate to how fun it will be? In this case, it\\'s a positive \"yes\".  Graphics - 8/10: For an early game for the 2 next-gen consoles and the PC, Oblivion is an eye appealing game. They don\\'t cover up things or supposedly create an illusion of good visuals by putting gray and brown everywhere. This game isn\\'t afraid to show color. The mouth syncing is very well done, save for a few occasional moments where the game glitches out. Not only do the individual objects look fantastic, they seem to blend in very well to the environment.  Gameplay - 9/10: Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is a single player first-person RPG. You use R1 to swing your sword or use your main weapon, just like a First-Person Shooter using it to fire a gun. You also use your L1 to block, corresponding to your respective hands in the game. The controls are easy to pick up, but hard to master, as you\\'ll have to quickly learn to hot-key items and spells, use magic, and get to know your environment, as well as yourself. You start the game selecting your character\\'s class (although you can master all the classes later on) and appearance/race (as in dark elf, human, etc). There is no way your character is going to look good, as it seems that these character models are cursed to be ugly. You go through the game doing either the main-story quest, or doing the smaller side-quests in between. Following RPG tradition, this game requires some grinding and patience. But what sets this RPG apart, is the amount of sheer detail in the environment. I\\'m not talking about graphics, but you can virtually pick up any object in the game. See a little bowl on the desk? You can pick it up and put it in your inventory if you want, although it may be considered stealing.That\\'s another thing. This game has strict laws, so it may be considered a free-roaming RPG, but you can\\'t go on a killing spree without encountering nearly invincible guards, and paying a harsh fine. This takes away some fun, but it adds this realistic tone into the game, and balances it nicely. Another thing you will notice is just how big the world is. I\\'m guessing it will take you at least 4 real life hours to walk around the entire land. Luckily, there\\'s a fast-forward walking system for fast transportation.  I\\'m going to go straight to the point with the AI... They\\'re merely just programed to do certain things at certain conditions, and are completely predictable. With such a large game, you\\'re going to run into some pacing problems, which every large RPG game seems to have trouble in, and this game is no exception. You will occasionally run into some bumps along the road which could force you to get stronger from the optional quests. But if you\\'re not a hardcore RPG veteran, then you\\'ll be discouraged for sure. Sometimes you may not get enough of Oblivion, and sometimes, you may not even touch the game for months at a time. They do attempt to keep things moving with many quests and exploration, but if you\\'re stuck, there\\'s not much to push you forward to keep trying.  Sound - 8/10: The sound is appropriate for the game\\'s setting of medieval times. Although I would have liked to see more variety, the sound effects shine in this game. Everything makes a sound. From the little pots/pans to weapons, and even the wind during some gusty days. The soundtrack gets boring quite quickly, as you\\'ll soon get to know each song note-for-note. A wider soundtrack would have been great. Another neat thing is how every bit of dialog uses actual voice acting. There won\\'t be any boxes of text you have to read, with some cut-scenes with voice. There is always voice for dialog, and it\\'s consistently good. However, they seem to have only 3 or so voice actors doing hundreds of characters, which sounds really strange as you may talk to 5 people in a bar who sound exactly the same.  Value - 10/10: I\\'m putting two things into account here.One, this game will take you at least a hundred hours if you do the side quests, making it a great bargain.Two, it\\'s only $30 now for the PS3. How can you beat that? I\\'m trying to think of a reason for docking marks for it\\'s value, but I have no reason to not give it a perfect ten.  Story - \"borrows story from others\": You wake up in a prison/dungeon. Soon, you tag along with with the king (who let\\'s you go) so you can defend him with his guards against assassins. Eventually, they catch up to the king and assassinate the old bugger. As you may have predicted already, you must find a lost heir to the throne (how original). Along with it, you have to find the Amulet of Kings which proves the heir\\'s right to the throne and all that kingly business. Also, to make matters worse, there are demons coming from another dimension called Oblivion, sending you on even more quests to close all of the portals. The story doesn\\'t really feel all that epic or original, but it\\'s a decent story. But it\\'s only my opinion, and some people I know love the story.  CONCLUSION: If you don\\'t usually play RPGs, this game is definitely still worth a buy, especially since it\\'s only $30, but RPG fans will get a huge kick out of this as it takes everything right about an RPG, and adds even more to it. With a taste for a huge adventure and attention to detail, Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is for you.  Graphics - 8/10 Gameplay - 9/10 Sound - 8/10 Value - 10/10 Story - \"borrows story from others\" OVERALL - 4 STARS',\n",

       "  'description': \" The Legend of Zelda:Collector's Edition is worth purchasing from someone. It combines the original The Legend of Zelda, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. I would have gotten this disk if it only let me play just Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, or Majora's Mask. But this comes with 4 games! Really recommended for people who are new to the Zelda series, and only have a gamecube/Wii. Or someone just too lazy to pull out the old NES/SNES/N64.  The first Legend of Zelda offers the classic Zelda 2D game, where you have the overhead view of Link. This is a fairly difficult game, and is great for the more seasoned Zelda fans, though anyone could play/beat it with time.  The Adventure of Link is also a 2D Zelda game, but has a much different feel to it. When you walk into a town, dungeon, or battle it becomes a 2D scroller. It still had the 2D overhead view, but only while you were roaming the world. I didn't really like this game that much. I'd avoid this one at all costs. I think of it as the outcast of Zelda games.  Do I even have to talk about Ocarina of Time? Well I am. Maybe the single greatest 3D Zelda there ever was. Tough dungeons, fun sidequests. A nice change of pace, and what the new Zelda games are being defined by. If you call yourself a Zelda fan and have not played this game, you sir are a great big LIAR! Majora's Mask has to be one of my most favourite games to play. Whether I'm just rolling around as a Goron, swimming through the ocean as a Zoro, flying through the air as a Deku(Okay it's not that fun...), riding around on Epona, or completing one of the dungeons within the 3 day time limit. The 3 day limit adds that degree of difficulty, unless you cheat like me and play the Inverted Song of Time. =) There are also so many more sidequests in Majora's Mask that make the game interesting.All in all I would rate this a 10/10, even with the drawbacks from Legend of Zelda 2: The Adventure of Link. Must buy for any gamer.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'The hyped up title that came out with the Playstation 3. It was ramped up as being the only title to play on Day 1 and it mostly delivers.The graphics were good then but they were not as rival titles on the Xbox 360(Resistance 2 looks to change that).It runs smooth, but when you get up close to objects the textures look like PS2 games.This game does boast a VERY long campaign( especially for a shooter) and is a blast playing Cooperative with a friend, though it suffers that\\xa0 this co-op is offline only. The weapons are like the ones in Insomniacs other acclaimed series, Ratchet and Clank. This meaning that they have alternate fire and are just crazy.The Multiplayer offers a suite of options(40-players!!) and the maps are ginormous so it nevers feels like too much of a clusterfuck, but since this was a day 1 title it has not fully integrated the PlaystationNetworks features that you are accustom to seeing on Xbox Live.\\xa0So at the end of the day, this game is still good despite its flaws and deserves to be in your collection even it is just to get brushed up on the story for Resistance 2.p.s this review was written by a 13 year old and i think its decent for my first review.',\n",

       "  'description': \"From a mini game to a full fledged release, Geometry Wars started as a simple game found within Project Gotham Racing 2 for the Xbox, and has since then been released on Xbox Live Arcade and PC for a small price. Now it's hit the Nintendo's seventh generation console and handheld, the Wii and the DS under the title Geometry Wars: Galaxies, but does it offer enough to justify the price?The premise of the game is simple. You'll control a ship-shaped... shape, and shoot enemy, well, shapes. You'll fly around inside what pretty much is a... shape, shooting the other shapes that come at you. The enemy shapes spawn from all over the place, and each different shape behaves differently. A propeller shaped enemy will fly aimlessly around, circles will act as black holes sucking everything up, and a triangle tailed snake will wiggle around the stage, along with plenty other shapes, making for a pretty good enemy variety. You'll have infinite ammo, and a small amount of bombs to completely clear the screen if things ever get too hectic.Unlike an Xbox 360, the DS lacks dual analogue sticks, so you'll need to settle with a different control scheme. You'll have to settle with either using the D-Pad and face buttons to move and shoot, or the D-Pad to move and stylus to shoot. The D-Pad and stylus is actually very accurate, and it's not as cramp inducing as say, Metroid Prime Hunters or Call of Duty 4. Both control options have left and right handed options, so any lefties won't have to fear for their hands with this one.But what exactly does the game to to justify it's price? So far, it's sounding exactly the same as Retro Evolved, but with different controls. I doubt anyone is all for paying $30 for a $5 game, but hear this: Retro Involved is included in Galaxies as a very small side mode. The main attraction is a full fledged campaign mode, with dozens of galaxies to travel to, each shaped differently, with different obstacles inside. It starts off simple enough, even moreso than Retro Evolved. The first level is a simple small rectangle. Keep on playing, and the level designs change. You'll wind up in all sorts of levels of different shapes and sizes, and encounter things like moving squares that act as walls, an annoying little circle dropping mines everywhere, or a black hole sucking up everything around it.You won't get anywhere just blasting through though. As you play, you'll collect Geomes, the games currency. Collecting Geomes during a match will increase your multiplier for the match, but once you finish a match, you can spend Geomes to open new galaxies and planets, and get back to blasting some more shapes.You're not traveling alone though. Helping you along the way is your trusty Drone, sort of. It'll take a while for it to truly be of some use, as you'll need to level it up by using it a lot. There are a number of different drones to use throughout the game, each helping in something like Attacking, Defending, and other patterns and behaviors that'll help you out along the way, so long as you keep on working with that Drone. Also, you'll need to purchase them like you do galaxies and planets, so make sure you save up those Geomes. The difficulty certainly ramps up well, and later in the game you'll definitely be bombarded by those evil shapes to no end, so putting those Drones to good use helps.There's tons of reason to replay the game. You can see how well your shape blasting skills match up to other players using the online leaderboards. You can also play multiplayer Co-Op, which has you working together shooting stuff, Vs., which has one player creating enemies for the other to shoot, and Simultaneous, which is pretty much a score attack. All of these modes can be played single or multi-card.There's also a bit of Wii to DS and DS to DS connectivity. If you hook up the Wii and the DS games, you'll unlock a new galaxy to play on. You can also send a full version of Retro Evolved to a friend with a DS.The DS version certainly loses some of the flair that it's Wii counterpart and Retro Evolved has, yet it still manages to keep much of the crazy particle effects that give the series it's unique style. The distorting grid is gone, but you can be sure that random lights and shapes will be all over the place when things get hectic. Unfortunately, there can be some slowdown, but not too much that it gets really annoying. The game also has an upbeat techno soundtrack that works fits well with the game, and some of them are pretty catchy.Geometry Wars: Galaxies is a fun, addictive game. Anyone who's a fan of the original should pick it up. If you just like plain fun, shooting stuff, or have something against shapes, this game is for you.\",\n",

So for all the \\'would-be\\' Crysis owners out there, make sure to read the box and get those system requirements before you sink 50 dollars on a game that will be a glorified slideshow on your computer.Before I begin on the game itself though, I want to make it clear that I am reviewing the vanilla 1.00 release of Crysis, not the most recent 1.20 Patch.After installation and configuring settings, Crysis drops you right into the action. Literally. And the game takes it from there and runs. You play as \\'Nomad,\\' a group of US Delta Force agents sent to rescue several scientists on a Pacific Island that has been taken over by North Korean Military group in order to cover up whatever it is the scientists have found. But even in the intro, the plot of the game stumbles over itself and does a bad job of making anything particularly mysterious. Maybe I\\'m looking at the game the wrong way, but by the time Nomad quite literally crashed into the water from your team\\'s botched jump onto the island, I had the first few scenes almost called to the letter. Now, this wouldn\\'t be that big of a deal for Crysis if it hadn\\'t come out in the wake of Bioshock and Half-Life 2: Episode Two where narrative actually keeps you going and keeps you engaged. Crysis on the otherhand feels like a run-of-the-mill Sci-fi Action Flick.The main thing though that everyone will notice the second their game starts is the visuals. This game\\'s presentation is stunning and it is still giving other games that have since come out in \\'08 a run for their money. I\\'d go so far as to say that it beats Metal Gear Solid 4\\'s visuals easily, and anyone who\\'s had a chance to play that game on a large 1080p display knows that is no simple task. One thing that really had me impressed were the character models. The first time you see all your comrades with their helmets off in the first scene is just amazing. Crytec has made characters that actually look human without falling face first down into the uncanny valley and they\\'re one of the few developers out there who have managed to not make their characters look like they\\'re at least partially plastic. But my admiration of the visuals was abruptly cut off when I killed a foe and his texture glitched, consuming the environment in front of me and making it significantly harder to navigate until I looked away from the visual space he decided to occupy. I wouldn\\'t be complaining and docking the game too much if this had been a one time thing, but it happened again. And again. And then it happened with a group of enemies that weren\\'t even dead, but they were supposed to be cloaked. It basically turned into me shooting into gigantic-korean-foe blobs that had devoured my screen, while I hoped that I\\'d manage to actually hit him and get his glitched existence out of my face.For all of those people starting Crysis for the first time though, there is one other thing you\\'ll notice. The mandatory nanosuit teaser scene before the game actually gives you control. This scene channels modern hollywood action flicks and shows off the fancy nanosuit you\\'ll be wearing in the game. This nanosuit is the main gameplay feature that anyone following Crysis has heard about many times. Simply by holding down the middle mouse button, you are presented with a radial dial that allows you to change which mode your suit currently has engaged from the four available modes: Cloaking, Armor, Speed, Power. Cloaking is fairly self-explanatory. You turn effectively invisible at long ranges, but your suit\\'s power drains quickly so long as you\\'re in motion. While cloaked, enemies will still be able to hear you and will fire at those noises and going invisible in front of your enemies will only get you so far if you aren\\'t booking it away from them because it won\\'t stop them from shooting at you. But, alas, cloak was kind of a deal-breaker for me. Through most of the beginning of the game, if you have a habit of almost never using ammo and conserving as much as possible, you\\'ll probably quickly figure out that if you slowly move around your patrol of foes while cloaked and then just switch to speed if needed, you\\'ll be able to avoid many conflicts. It changes the feel of the game from an action game to a stealth game set to \"way too easy.\" I had figured that I\\'d be able to use the cloak to ambush enemies or pull off predator-esque attacks, but in the end I realized most of that effort was better spent not even wasting rounds on the normal AI. Back to the other three abilities. Armor makes you take less damage from all sources, including fall damage and will allow you to regenerate at a very fast rate if you stay still. Speed allows you to move faster, and if you engage your sprint, you\\'ll move exceptionally fast, but only for a brief burst. Power increases your overall strength- allowing you to throw things farther, jump higher and hit harder. All in all, the system works, and it is fun during the more tense scenes, but sometimes it feels too easy to dupe the AI.That\\'s not to say that the AI isn\\'t good, in fact, the human AI is all executed incredibly well. Enemies will react to your movements and the noise you make and generally try their hardest to flush you out where ever you may be, especially on higher difficulties (as an interesting little tidbit- at the highest difficulty, the game introduces the language barrier, causing the North Koreans to actually speak Korean) but that doesn\\'t mean you can\\'t ever manage to elude them, as I have previously written. In one scene, I had found a very nice sniper ledge, pulled out my rifle and fit it for silent sniping (customization is another big feature of the game, and I\\'ll touch on that in a bit) and slowly picked off the guards in the camp, but I noticed that they began to follow the shots and eventually I had to deal with a search party that arrived at my location, so the AI can and will find you if you stay still and don\\'t neutralize them quickly.The last big feature I want to talk about is the customization. At more or less anytime, you can press the customization key on your keyboard and the focus will shift to your weapon (and will add a little Depth of Field blur around the edges for effect) and you will have all sorts of add-ons and choices depending on the weapon, ranging from supressors to reflex sights and scopes depending on the situation. It definitely has its uses and it works seamlessly with everything else, so all in all, I like it.Crysis is a good game. It is a solid shooter, and anyone looking for a game to play that has a PC to run it won\\'t be disappointed. But do I think it was game of the year material? No. It has its shortcomings and its flaws and overall just feels like one of those generic shooters that you might play through a couple of times and be done with. It has an enjoyable multiplayer that you may or may not get into, depending on your views of competitive shooters, so you\\'ve always got that to look at as well once you\\'ve wrapped up the story and its obligatory cliff-hanger ending for the already announced sequels in this trilogy of games. With some polish, I\\'d say that Crysis definitely holds promise as a series in the future.',\n",

       "  'description': 'It\\'s really hard to look at JSRF and say, \"man, that looks like a rad game.\" However, this is exactly what you should do. JSRF takes place in a fictional futuristic Tokyo where the everyone is oppressed by a hostile police force except for a small group of Jet Setters on roller blades with rockets on them (hold on let me finish). The object of the game is obviously to put forth some sort of rebellion against the police. Visually the game is a stunning piece of work. The city is vibrant, expansive, and full of life. Little in the environment is interactive but really you don\\'t notice while playing. The art direction almost feels like an urban Okami.The controls feel solid and very tight, which is important when jumping hundreds of feet many stories up in the air. The characters react as you would expect them to as they move around the environments.Most of the gameplay consists of skating throughout an environment and finding spots where you can \"tag\" the wall using grafitti. After the player has tagged all of the appropriate spots in the environment a boss will appear and will engage you in some sort of race or battle (usually some combination of the two.) The bosses have enough variety so they never feel like the exact same thing twice. Sound is another hugely important part of this game. The game is full of funky Hip-Hop beats with a decidedly Japanese slant, which actually sounds way better than that description just did.Overall the game\\'s charm, wit, and very solid gameplay make this one of the most fun games on the original xbox. It\\'s probably very cheap now used, everyone should check it out.',\n",

       "  'description': 'God Hand is the swan song game by developer Clover Studio, best known for their games in the \"Viewtiful Joe\" series as well as the stylish action-adventure game \"Okami.\" It is a beat \\'em up game set in a post-apocalyptic, science fiction backdrop with numerous queues from the anime; \"Fist of the North Star.\"  The game puts you in the role of a young man named Gene who, after a fated meeting with a girl named Olivia, gains possession of the Godhand, a divine weapon that bestows upon its user great strength and the ability to slay demons with ease. Gene travels with Olivia while she has him do various tasks with the end goal being to defeat the Demon King, Angra. While the premise isn\\'t exactly deep, God Hand makes up for it with it\\'s really unique sense of style as well as oddball humor sewn throughout the game.  God Hand will have you fight across numerous locales including dusty western-style desert towns, and even a circus big top.\\xa0 The level designs themselves, however, are pretty bland in design. The path presented to you in a level is often very straight forward leaving little in the way of varying paths for the player to take. Also, while the character models look great, the environment textures come off as a little muddy in spots and don\\'t really stand up well when compared to the character models. The sound in this game fairs a little better. God Hand is accompanied by a unique and interesting soundtrack encompassing various genres of music including Techno, Metal, and even Surf Rock. Though some of the music seems out of place at first, you quickly realize that it\\'s so out of place that it\\'s actually quite fitting. The sound effects are another strong point with Gene\\'s blows sounding fittingly brutal and hard-hitting. However, there is one thing that God Hand does very well; and that\\'s the combat. The gameplay in God Hand hearkens back to the classic beat \\'em up games of old, the difference here being how the player can customize Gene\\'s various moves in the game. At the start of the game, Gene has a basic 4 hit combo, as well as 2 other attack buttons. All the attack buttons in the game can be customized in the Techniques menu where Gene can change how each move in his combo acts and what special moves he can use. While the gameplay can get repetitive at times, this is alleviated by the sheer number of movies available to Gene throughout the course of the game. There are literally hundreds of moves at your disposal, ensuring that no two player\\'s combos will be identical, and keeps the combat fresh throughout the duration of the game.  The other primary way players do battle in God Hand is through the Roulette Wheel, which is by far the most intriguing part of God Hand\\'s gameplay. The Roulette Wheel stores all of Gene\\'s \"Special Moves\" that are available in the game. They often are capable of dispatching many regular enemies in the game in a single move, and are able to deal considerable damage to boss characters as well. Gene is limited by how often he can perform these movies with the number of Orbs at his disposal. Stronger moves take more orbs to use, while the weaker ones only require a single Orb. The Roulette Wheel provides an interesting strategic level to God Hand\\'s gameplay as the player must carefully decide when to perform these moves. Do you use it on this large group of thugs to quickly end the battle? Or do you save the Orbs for the upcoming boss fight? The one blemish in the controls is that Gene’s movement and camera controls are quite archaic in function. You’ll often find yourself struggling to find an enemy around you and properly line yourself up with said enemy to attack him. Trying to run away from battle can also be quite difficult at times. God Hand has a very unique sense of humor. The Dialog in the game sounds intentionally campy, and the absurdity of the story is sure to get more than a few chuckles out of you here and there. The humor is even shown in the gameplay through Gene’s various actions and attacks. For instance; Gene has a move on the Roulette Wheel called the ‘Ball Buster,’ which… does exactly what it says. Gene kicks his enemy in their nether regions, temporarily stunning them so Gene can deliver a devastating combo or suplex. Yes, there are wrestling moves in this game. God Hand certainly isn’t a game for everyone. The humor might be off putting to some, and others might find it difficult to deal with the movement controls. But to anyone able to overlook that, God Hand is a unique action game quite unlike anything you’ve ever played before.',\n",

       " {'deck': 'Long Live the Fantasy that is Final Fantasy X',\n",
       "  'description': 'The previous releases in the long running Final Fantasy Series were successful, but the series was brought to an all new level with the worldwide success of Final Fantasy VII. Since then, few games that have been released in the series have been able to live up to the standards set forth by number seven. Final Fantasy X may not be the greatest game ever created, but it proudly and rightfully wears the tag of a Final Fantasy game.  Final Fantasy has built it’s legacy not just on the gameplay, but on the story and Final Fantasy X continues that long standing tradition. You are Tidus, a star Blitzball player and somehow you have traveled through time where you find that your home no longer exists. It is your mission to get back to your home, to get back to Zanarkand. However, along the way you encounter many a friend and foe which lead you to an epic showdown with the cause of everything, Sin.  Character development is perfectly setup, especially in terms of Tidus. When you go into the future after spending a little time in Zanarkand, you know no more and no less than Tidus when it comes to what exactly is going on. As you progress through the game, you grow, you learn and you mature as Tidus does.  The story is well laid out and easy to get into. The characters you associate with, both playable and non-playable help you throughout your journey. They teach you everything you need to know so that you can get home. The character interaction is simply spectacular, by the end of the game you will have a strong love or a strong hate for almost every character that played a major roll in the story.  Final Fantasy X features the same addictive gameplay as it turn-based predecessors. However, with the inclusion of the Sphere Grid, this tradition Japanese Role Playing Game has expanded upon a simple formula and managed to drag it’s players into something that is a lot deeper than the standard role playing game. You level up as you gain combat experience from battling various monsters; these points are used on the Sphere Grid to improve your abilities. It is like a puzzle, all characters appear on one sphere grid, but start in completely different areas. The value of this is simple; you can cover every end of the massive Sphere Grid and thus have each character designed for doing something different. Some may be used for destroying the high defenses of Sin and other monsters through brute force while others may be used for magic, defense and so on. The graphics are beautiful to look at, they aren’t overly ornate and thus don’t over impose themselves on the player. Instead, they merely sit in the background and add to an already amazing game. The summons (monsters that can be called into battle by Yuna) are absolutely beautiful as are the cut scenes. The highlight of the graphics is Yuna’s Kimono when she performs the sending (Sending away dead spirits to the Far Plane which is basically like a graveyard where they are protected from becoming monsters) as it flows just as her body and spirit do.  The background music is excellent as it fits nicely with the boss battles, Blitzball games and everything in-between. The voice acting is quite well done; the only problem is that most of the time you’ll be forced to read somewhat lengthy dialogue due to speech outside of cut scenes. It is not the end of the world that not everything is given to you orally as the text is easily read, but it would always be nice to be hear all the words since it allows for players to be further drawn into the game.  The ‘game within a game’ featured in Final Fantasy X ties in with the main character Tidus. He is a star Blitzball player and game featured is of course, Blitzball. It becomes available for play shortly after you start the game and will prove to be a huge factor as you shape your journey. The story of Final Fantasy X may be extremely linear in it’s essence, but there are many ways you can go about it to create an unique game experience. The biggest customization feature is your Blitzball team, you travel the continent in search of the best Blitzball players, you hire them and deal with their contracts. Your players level up as does your team all in the name of becoming the best Blitzball team, ever.  There are multiple modes in which you can play Blitzball; Exhibition, League Play and Tournament. In each mode you take your team to the arena in hopes of earning new skills, money and items that will help you in your quest which is ever present in the main storyline. However, playing Blitzball isn’t an essential part of playing Final Fantasy X. Nevertheless it is a great game that will keep your attention for dozens and dozens hours.  There are many unlockables as each character has their own secret weapon that you can unlock throughout the course of the game. There are also the extremely rare items and of course, the Jecht Shot, a powerful Blitzball move. These unlockables generally take a back seat to other aspects of the game, but nevertheless they further enhance the gaming experience.  Final Fantasy X is an amazing game for both hardcore fans of the series and for first timers. It provides tutorials on how to do everything from using the Sphere Grid to playing Blitzball and everything in-between. The best part about these said tutorials is that they are informative, easy to follow and do not disrupt gameplay. In short, Final Fantasy X lives up to the expectations players have of the Final Fantasy Series as it manages to provide an entertaining and unique experience for all players.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Shadow of the Colossus is not a video game. It\\'s more like an interactive piece of art. In an industry full of shooters and generic games, Shadow is a huge breath of fresh air. Personally, I think Shadow of the Colossus was 5 years ahead of its time. It never let me go until I finished it. Not once.  Graphics – 9/10: The graphics still look great today for a PS2 game. Shadow uses a light blurring effect which makes the entire world seem better looking. The draw distance is superb and the colossi look downright gorgeous. Everything looks as it should be. The animation is absolutely the best you can hope for, as the characters have expression-filled movements with plenty of depth and good movement transitions. There are some glitchy textures now and then with some objects popping into the screen, but all is forgiven when you really look at everything that makes this game shine.  Gameplay – 9/10: Shadow of the Colossus is one hell of a unique game. Take an average adventure game, and take out all of the repetitiveness, any enemies between bosses, make unique boss fights, throw in tons of unique elements, and you\\'ve got Shadow. That\\'s right; you have no enemies in between boss battles. Instead, you start each level at the center temple in a huge over-world. You count on only your sword, bow/arrows, and horse to hunt down and battle each colossus (the huge bosses). This is where the game gets crazy fun. Each battle, you are presented with a colossus with a different method of fighting in a different environment. You run around searching for a weakness, or a way to trigger an opening. Once you find it, you usually have to climb onto the fur/scales/anything you can get your hands on. Shadow uses an interesting system, where you hold down R1 to grab onto virtually anything exposed as good climbing material on the colossi\\'s body. This gets really crazy as the colossi are usually 50 times your size! As they try to shake you off, you\\'ll struggle to find their weak spot and stab it silly until the monstrous beast dies. Each battle will leave you speechless and utterly hooked into the game. You have your horse for battling some colossi, as well as being a fantastic way to travel through a HUGE world. You\\'ll have your sword, which is good for battling colossi, as well as acting as a compass/guide to your next destination/colossi\\'s weakness. The bows and arrows come in handy during some brain teasing battles. You never get stronger in Shadow. Only the player can improve, and that\\'s it. (save for raising your HP and grip meter) You can unlock some extra items such as the whistling arrow later, but don\\'t add a huge layer to the gameplay. Everything\\'s fantastic gameplay-wise, and this is mostly true for the controls as well. The button layout is great, and camera controlling is a breeze, but you\\'ll find that your character is quite delayed and sometimes frustrating to control. The movements feel a little slippery at the beginning, but you\\'ll soon get the hang of it, although more tuning up on controls would have been nice.   Sound – 10/10: Team ICO didn\\'t hold anything back when it came to the sound. The music is just freaking perfect, as it sets the mood for epic confrontations and fast battles. To add to that, all dialogue is spoken. Not satisfied? The dialogue spoken is not English, but a made up language with subtitles underneath it which just blew my mind away. This fictional language is very believable and every well spoken. The voice acting is great, although there are just two main voices in the game. Everything shines in the sound department.  Value – 8/10: Shadow of the Colossus will take you around eight to ten hours, and once you beat each boss, you will have already figured out their weaknesses, which ruins some of the fun. Yet, there\\'s a time-attack mode which adds an element of competition into it, and extra miscellaneous items you can unlock. Other than that, there\\'s nothing much to keep you into Shadow of the Colossus except for one thing; the pure art of the game. Who wouldn\\'t want to keep a game where you can fight gigantic monsters? It\\'s just so satisfying to have a game like this in your possession. So run, don\\'t walk to a game dealership. Besides, the game\\'s only 30 dollars now.  Story – \"a familiar story turned enchanting and epic\" Shadow\\'s story is quite special. It has managed to turn a story, in which would have been incredibly generic into something special. The main story is of a young man with the help of his trusty stallion who travel to a forbidden land in search of a spirit known as Dormin. He seeks Dormin because he wishes to bring his lady friend back from the dead. He makes a deal with the mysterious spirit and agrees to seek and destroy 16 colossi without any thought. This may seem like a \"save your girl from death\" boring story, but it\\'s ingeniously put together with tons of great voice acting and a mysterious atmosphere. There\\'s a huge twist at the end, which you can predict if you can spot the clues. It just has that rich and hearty feeling of epicness which cannot be described in a player review. You have to experience it first hand.  CONCLUSION: Team ICO is absolutely amazing. How they come up with these things is unknown, but they delivered a jam-packed thrill ride here. You have never seen such a game in your life. The rush, the thrill of climbing gigantic and elegant creatures is absolute magic. The entire game makes me want to cry with joy. There may be some frustrating times of not being able to find the colossi, giving up on finding weak spots, and the like, but they just add onto the final feeling for this game. And it\\'s a good feeling for sure.  Graphics - 9/10 Gameplay - 9/10 Sound - 10/10 Value - 8/10 Story - \" a familiar story turned enchanting and epic\" OVERALL – 4.5 STARS',\n",

She succeeded (or so she thought) and the galaxy was safe once more. In 1992 Samus dawned her power suit for a second time to take out the queen Metroid and take them all out once and for all. After it was over the last of the Metroids hatched from an egg and mistook Samus for it's mother. Instead of killing it she took it with her. This is where Super Metroid picks up. Samus turns the last Metroid over to scientists on a space station for research. After Samus leaves she gets a distress signal from the station and goes to investigate. When she arrives everyone is dead and the Metroid is missing. Samus goes to the end of the ship to find that her old enemy Ridley is back and is attempting to take the final Metroid. Samus fights but Ridley makes his escape. The space station explodes and Samus follows Ridley back down to where it all started, Zebes.  Once every game system you get a game so great that it becomes immortal. This is what Super Metroid has become. It withstands the test of time and gives you a game that just keeps on giving and leaves your wanting more. The basic premise to Super Metroid is exploration. Your thrown into a world that your familiar with but has changed. You wonder around the map searching for new power ups for Samus that will allow you to reach new areas. You do this for the entire games going from areas flooded with plant life to places flooded with water, all the while gaining new abilities such as the space jump and screw attack. Super Metroid is very much like its counterparts. It's just as good and even better. The gameplay is repetitive on paper, but in execution it gives you one of the most rewarding and incredably fun experiences you'll have playing a video game.  Boss fights and plentiful with almost 10 in total and each one is just as memorable as the last. Each one is huge with their own special strengths and weaknesses and are challenging to boot. Every one will leave you breathless and on the edge of your seat.  Playing Super Metroid is almost like a religious experience. What most Hollywood movies go for in the thrills and surprises department Super Metroid delivers in loads. The ending will leave you shaken and may even possibly bring a tear to your eye.  You can get this game for $8 on the Virtual Console. That's more than a great deal. You shouldn't be hesitant on whether or not you should buy it, throw down the $8 and play one of the greatest games ever made. As far as 2D games go Super Metroid is the best.\",\n",

And you get there only to find there is zombies absolutely everywhere. Then you fly over this giant mall and a government chopper shows up forces you to land and Frank jump off and tells the helicopter guy to pick him up again in 3 days. So you have to survive in the mall during these days to think out why almost everyone have turned to zombies, uncover the plot and save as many survivors as possible, oh and also use everything in your surroundings to take out the zombies in the most brutal, bizarre or hilarious ways.The gameplay in Dead Rising is quite straightforward though not that repetitive since you'll face different phsycopats and have different objectives and all the time use different weapons, all missions are also time-based keeping the action more pumped up and also a little more challenging. What also does the game more challenging is the save system..both in a good way, but also in a bad way.The good is that you really have to be and your feet and stay alive until the next savepoint witch forces you to think and focus at the task at hand. The bad is that if you die you can be set back several hours gameplay wise if you're not careful since the game has very few autosaves and only one saveslot. This can be very punishing since if you save the game with very little time left on a mission and you can't finish it in time you'll loose the mission, if it's a Story mission you will be forced to start over again since you no longer wil be able to progress in the story, though you can at that point save your status for Frank...yep that's correct the game also has some RGP elements meaning that you will raise in level, gain new skill get more health etc. and if you save your status you will begin the game from scratch but you're a lot stronger, though I would have preferred a solution with more saveslots or at least more autosaves. There is another good thing about this though, that you will have much reason going trough the game several times handle different situation in differently.The graphics in the game are good and sharp the characters models look great as do the mall that looks very believable though it's not the best I've seen on the Xbox 360 but it's good enough to be eye pleasing and won't be anything that bugs youThe sound in the game is awesome, great music, great but also funny voice acting and the sound effects from the different weapons are basically perfection.So overall Dead Rising is a great game. Though a great games with problems that could have been solved differently without much effort. Still it's a game that fans of the genre and those that have been waiting to slay zombies in all kinds of ways simply have to try out.//ZimpanX \",\n",

       "  'description': \"Where to start? Well gears of war is most definitely the best game so far that has reached the current gen consoles. I will give you a relatively short, but sweet review of why GoW is imo GOTD.   Starting with the single player, it is just the right length; most surely not too short and not too long either (which is probably more annoying, I mean come on; who doesn't have 10 games in their collection that are so long that they have been dumped?). You feel like you have accomplished something incredibly awesome when you complete in on insane and the final cut scene just tops it off. The AI are pretty clever, but nothing particularly special except for when they work in groups. The programming is very good however at some points you do feel like you are just repelling 'waves' of enemies. Co-operative play is brilliant, especially when you know the person you are playing with; but is still fun if you don't and an easy way of making online friends.  The multi player; all you need to do now is ask ANYONE who has ever played Gears of War online especially ranked for a minimum of 10 hours and they will tell you how intensely amazing this online experience really is. You actually sometimes feel like you are in the game because of the unreal sound effects and incredulous visual effects (roadie running aka holding A, with the volume on max on an HDTV will blow you away). Obviously it is not perfect, no online games are because there are always people will ruin the experience for others even when there is no gain for them to do so. However, most of the time the people you meet are friendly (unless you provoke them) and are all healthily competitive.  The best graphics, the best sound effects, the most originality, the best online, the best offline. The best game of this decade and will be looked back on as one of the greatest of all time, undoubtedly.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Sam & Max Episode 1: Culture Shock is the first episode of 6 that takes PC gaming back to it's roots. This is a simple point and click adventure game that plays just like they used too back in the early 90's and even before that. There's no health bar or boss fights like most games of today. You solve puzzles by talking to people and getting clues or using items to get the job done. It's a great and rewarding gameplay experience that, while short, does what it sets out to do and ends up being a memorable experience.  In Sam & Max you play as Sam. He's a humanoid dog creature that just happens to be a freelance police officer who takes on cases for the money. With his on his adventures is his humanoid rabbit sidekick who offers up some really strange dialog. The game opens up with your phone ringing and it turns out the office rat has stolen it and he demands some swiss cheese for the phone. You don't have swiss cheese but you do have a closet full of regular cheese and gun. Well you get the picture. This is how the game plays. You get items and you use those items to get through the story.  There is also a lot of talking in this game. Everyone you see you can talk to and you pick from a list of things to say to them. You'll have to do this to get more information out of people that give you clues as to what you need to do next. Thankfully the game sounds wonderful with a great soundtrack and some suburb voice talent.  Length wise the game is pretty short. The bulk of the game is talking to people and solving the puzzles. If you know what to do and skip all the dialog you can get through the game in about 30 minutes to an hour. But you won't know exactly what to do your first time through and you'll need to talk to people since that's were all the fun is. So your first time through will take you 4 to 5 hours. But thankfully this is episodic. So once your done with this game you can move on the next and continue the story.  It's a great adventure game that anyone should check out. \\t\\t\",\n",

The dialog is funny and the voice acting is great.  Episode 2 is shorter than the previous episode. You can get through the game in about 2 or 3 hours if the puzzles don't get your stuck for long.

       "  'description': 'The game selection available for the Nintendo DS is full of games that are highly addictive, spanning from life simulation games such as Animal Crossing: Wild World to strategy games like Advance Wars: Dual Strike. The DS is loaded with plenty of games that you turn on to play for a few minutes and end up playing for a few hours. Clubhouse Games successfully continues that long standing tradition of providing tons of gameplay hours for anyone who plays it.  Clubhouse Games is a quick way to play many of your favourite games without the hassle of having to pull them out of the cupboard and having to find the space to play them. It is a handy way to play those same great games on the go. You can play alone, against friends and family or any other gamer online. There is always someone ready and willing to play a game with you. It is a great multiplayer game whether you are sitting next to your opponent or playing with someone whom you have never met. The ability to chat with your opponent during the game makes it even more fun to play actual people instead of computers.  There are a total of 42 games available for play in Clubhouse Games, spanning from simple card games to action games with a lot in between. There are in-depth explanations of each and every game featured in Clubhouse Games. This allows you to take advantage of the entire collection of games by giving you the ability to play each game with the knowledge of what exactly is happening.  The gameplay is realistic, you feel as if you are actually playing your favourite card and board games. The utilization of the touch screen is smooth and is completely appropriate for the game. Instead of clicking buttons to play your favourite card and board games, you use your stylus on the touch screen to play your cards, place bets and to navigate from game to game.  There are three single player modes which can be played; Free Play, Stamp and  mode. Free Play allows you to play any game you wish for as long or as little as you want. It is the perfect mode when you only have a few minutes to play. The difficulty and number of opponents can be changed by you, giving you the ability to customize the game to your liking. You can make it more challenging or just add in more people, it is really up to you.  Stamp mode is the “story mode” of the game, despite there not being a story it is still quite fun. You go up levels by playing different games, the better you play in each game, the quicker you advance to the next level. The reason it is called stamp mode is because each level requires you to get three stamps for each game before you are able to advance. If you win the game, then you receive all three stamps that are required for that level. If you lose, then you receive one of the three stamps that you need before you can advance. This game clearly awards you for winning; by winning you complete the levels at a quicker pace. However, losing is not the end of the world; it just means that you will have to spend a little more time getting the stamps for that particular game.  The third single player game mode is  mode in which you have to complete certain missions within games, an example of this is: “Get rid of all your cards in Spit in less than 90 seconds.” It puts a fun spin on all your favourite games. This mode is enjoyable and offers plenty of gameplay hours by just adding a little challenge to your favourite games.  You can unlock quite a few things in this game including user icons and games. Not all games are available for play from the start. To unlock them you have to obtain all three stamps for that game in Stamp mode. User icons are unlocked by completing missions in  mode. User icons are nothing more than something to look at, but it is fun to collect them all. There is a wide variety of user icons to choose from as they span from animals to facial expressions. With these unlockables, Stamp and  mode become even more appealing to gamers and successfully mark themselves as a “must play” mode.  The graphics are exactly what is expected for games on the Nintendo DS. They are neither jaw-dropping nor flat out ugly. For card and board games, the graphics are sufficient. They are nothing to boast or complain about; the game is not unpleasant to the eyes nor is it a graphical masterpiece.  The sound in this game is decent, it is not completely terrible, but it is not amazing. Songs tend to get repetitive and the sounds within the games can easily become annoying. More often than not, you will find yourself turning down the sound on the game.  Dollar for dollar this game will give you the most replay value possible. It is available for a modest price of $34.99 Canadian. You cannot go wrong with the purchase of this game. Whether you are playing alone or playing with other humans, it is more likely that you will have to stop playing before you actually want to. The single player game modes are great and can be played for hours on end. The multiplayer modes are just as impressive as they offer up a great game experience for everyone involved. Even when defeated by other human players, this game manages to keep you in a state of happiness.  In short, Clubhouse Games is one of the best collections of games available for any gaming system. Not only does it give you exactly what you expect of it, but it also provides you with so much more. Clubhouse Games is one of those games that you pick up to play for a few minutes and end up playing for a few hours.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Welcome to a world where you join a young hero and his friends on a quest of might and magic, as you fight your way through political schemes, corruption, revolution and mystical orbs.Story:Suikoden is a game loosely based on a classical Chinese novel named Shui Hu Zuhan. The novel details the trials and tribulations of 108 outlaws and it from this Konami and Suikoden borrowed the concept of the 108 Stars of Destiny. That is what I know about that.You start by naming the young hero (his name is Tir McDohl in the novelization by Shinjiro Hori), who is the son of a great Scarlet Moon Empire general named Teo McDohl.You begin in a castle with your father, Teo. You are beginning your role by following your fathers footsteps in the Scarlet Moon Empire's military. You and your father stands before Emperor Barbarossa where he asks your father to go on a northern campaign. The Emperor has high hopes for you and hopes\\xa0 that one day you might become like your father. And so your adventure begins. You start of by taking a few missions with your friends, Pahn, Cleo, Gremio and Ted, but you soon notice that there is a lot of corruption in the Empire. When the Empire goes after your best friend Ted you decide to fight back and you end up joining, and eventually becoming the leader of a rebellion army. Now you start down the path to fulfill your destiny when you travel around the land making new friends and enemies, fighting large wars, discovering mysterious runes\\xa0 all while fighting for justice and to protect those close to you.Gameplay: 9,5 / 10The gameplay is great. You get your own castle that will grow in time as you recruit other Stars of Destiny to fight by your side. And as it grows new features is unlocked like gambling, bath, storage, shops and more.When playing you can have up to six characters assigned to your team and you are free to choose them from the 108 SoD that you have recruited. Some of the 108 SoD are not playable, but are support characters in the wars, but there are still many to choose from. You get the chance to form a team of your own will. Some characters will unlock special unite attacks when you have them in your party making them even stronger. And if that is not good enough for you, you can attach runes to the characters that can make their attacks stronger or allow you to use powerful magic to defeat your foes. The magic runes will unlock stronger magic as you level in the game. Every character you can use in the game also has their own unique weapon that you can make stronger by taking to a blacksmith to get it sharpened and/or put rune on it to do magic damage as well, making it even more effective.In the game there are three battle systems.The first one is your regular well known party battles that you stumble upon when running in dungeons or the world map.The second is One Vs One, or Dual Battle if you like, where you have three options.1. Attack: A regular attack that can be defended against, thus the damage is halved or it can be countered by a desperate attack.2. Defend: You defend against a regular attack and take only half damage, but if you or your enemy are on a desperate attack it will counter it and do critical damage.3. Desperate attack: A powerful all out attack that does critical damage. Be careful, if you use it when your enemy is defending it will backfire on you.These battles is fairly easy if you just pay attention to what your opponent is saying.The third battle type is large scale war or army battle. Here you get to use all the characters you have recruited so far, but use them wisely. Here you can use Charge, Bow and Magic attacks and you have a forth option that allow you to do special things, from powering up to make the enemy turn to your side. These fights are not that hard as it is like a game of rock and scissors. It goes like this: Charge beats bow, bow beats magic, and magic beats charge.One important thing to mention is that you can actually lose characters in these battles. What do I mean? They can die or just get injured. If they die they are dead, not coming back so be a bit careful and remember to save before a big battle.Graphics: 9 / 10This graphics of this game is good. It is the good old 2D style we all love, or at least we who know to appreciate a good game when we see it. Most doesn't seem to understand that this game is on PS1 and that for that time this was good graphics. The graphics is clean and with no rough edges.Sound: 9 / 10The soundtrack in this game is very good. It have it's flaws, I will admit that, but most the time it was a perfect match for the story and the smaller cut scenes.Some final words:I recommend this game to all fans of the RPG genre. It is a great game that really makes you want to play it over and over again. I sure did. Only sad thing is that it is very short. You can complete this game in less than 20 hours and get all the 108 SoD. Nonetheless, Suikoden is one of the best games I have played and still is.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'GTA 4 manages to provide a deep word. Whether you\\'re following the great story or screwing around, it\\'s always a blast to play.  Graphics – 8.5/10: It\\'s hard to rate a game graphically when you know that there are thousands of activities going on around you. However, this is a review. The game looks amazing in certain lights. Sometimes, you might find yourself looking at a unique looking game where the character models look like RockStar Games\\' game art. Sometimes, you might be staring at a detailed environment of great shadow effects and lighting. Sometimes, you look at dull environments of blurry color. Unfortunately, the game suffers a bit from the huge world. The frame rate always seems to be a little lower than it should be. When driving like a madman, you\\'ll notice texture and building pop-ins as well. None of these things hinder the game-play, but are noticeable. However, it\\'s a marvel to witness a ton of activity in one small area. Graphically, the game does a great job of looking great, while maintaining such a level of activity.   Gameplay – 9.5/10: As most of you may know, Grand Theft Auto games are \"sandbox\" or \"free-roaming\" games. You\\'re essentially free to do almost anything you want to complete your objectives or desires. While having obvious limitations, RockStar has done an outstanding job of putting as much effort into the game-play as possible. The controls are solid. You use shoulder buttons to shoot, take cover, aim, and pick things up. The control scheme is strange at first, but RockStar\\'s rebellious control scheme works nicely, as buttons are mapped out so that you can use a certain group of buttons for certain situations. Running around is what you will probably be doing most of the time. You walk normally, but hold X and you will run. Tap X repetitively allows you to sprint. The catch is that you can get tired as well, so sprinting is not always the wise choice. Unfortunately, the game feels a little slow while walking, especially compared to driving and the fact that the city is so big. You can now scale small fences and such, but it always feels so slow as you let the climbing animation scale the wall/fence for you. This is where vehicles come in. You can use any car/truck/motorcycle/helicopter/scooter or whatever you find by stealing it. You will always be successful in taking a vehicle you want as long as there isn\\'t anything there to stop you. This can be achieved with a simple press of the triangle button, so accidental car-jackings may ensue. Vehicle controls are fluid, thanks to the physics engine, while drifting is a little too sensitive. You\\'ll have an assortment of weapons, ranging from pistols, to shotguns, to grenades. The police will not hesitate to take you out at the first sign of trouble, but are easily avoided just by driving away from their \"search circle\". This leads to an easy game, which is just sugar coated with more easiness due to the fact that auto-aiming is an option. Shooting is much better however, with the atrocious lock-on system replaceable with the Gears of War/Uncharted shoot and cover system in place. You can also choose to auto-aim towards their torsos, so that you can tap the analogue stick a tiny bit up-wards for some satisfying head shots. Everything works well, with just a few finicky touches. The basic structure of GTA4 is to maintain relationships, missions, and have random fun. You build relationships with characters over time and will have to take them out to dates, drinks, dinner, or maybe even a game of pool or two. Honestly, it gets tedious after a while, as it turns into a chore. Luckily, the missions are made so that you\\'re never bored. You cannot tell a main-story mission from a side mission, as RockStar has taken considerable effort into each mission. If you don\\'t feel like getting bossed around, you can participate in one of many fun activities, non-essential to the game. You can watch TV, play darts, or go on random killing sprees.     The possibilities are so endless, it would take me hours to give you all of the details. So please, let\\'s move on!   Sound – 9.5/10: Let\\'s get one thing out of the way first. The voice acting... is amazing. I haven\\'t been this convinced by characters since Heavenly Sword! Every character is unique in talking styles and have convincing tones/accents in their voices. This alone makes the sound amazing. You can listen on the radio for great licensed songs, because the game doesn\\'t offer a huge array of original scores. However, the radio talk-shows are priceless. In one of the many unique shows, I listened to the ranting of a guy about how video games are turning our children into monsters. I fell out of my couch, laughing at the irony.     The sound effects are great as well, as everything sounds as they should be.   Value – 10/10: The main game will take you a looooong time to finish. After you\\'re done, there\\'s the core game leftover, for your inner-beast to go on random killing sprees and whatnot. When you\\'re done the single player, there\\'s the multi-player waiting for you. This isn\\'t some sissy, multi-player scrapped together at the last minute - this is a full, crazy good multi-player. There are an abundance of modes such as death-match, to even racing! You\\'re definitely getting your money\\'s worth here.   Story – \"a true under-dog story with great characters\" You play as Niko, fresh off the boat of his old, war-torn country. He comes to America in search of fortunes, his cousin\\'s promises, and some personal matters. The game features amazing characters, with an actually likable protagonist this time around. As you move up the food chain, you\\'ll uncover organizations to help you reach the top with your ignorant cousin. The story is simply stunning - brimming with confidence and sheer humor. RockStar has simply put a ton of effort into this script.  CONCLUSION: If you haven\\'t noticed already, GTA4 isn\\'t that over-rated piece of trash everyone\\'s talking about. There\\'s just so much effort put into it that it even beats Oblivion in detail. If you have a PS3 or a 360, then grab a copy of this game - if you haven\\'t already that is. If you haven\\'t entered this generation of HD consoles, then this is a great place to start - that is, if you were planning on getting a PS3 or 360. I\\'m sure that you won\\'t regret it.  Graphics - 8.5/10 Gameplay - 9.5/10 Sound - 9.5/10 Value - 10/10 Story - \"a true under-dog story with great characters\" OVERALL – 4.5 STARS',\n",

       "  'description': 'The Warriors is a brawler based on a film of the same name. In the movie a man by the name of Cyrus held a meeting with all the gangs in New York. He wanted all of the gangs to join together to create one gang that could take over the city. He says \"Can you dig it!\" a couple of times to the crowd and a shady character with a mullet shoots and kills him. The shooter quickly blames the Warriors resulting in them having to sneak, fight, and run they\\'re way back to their hideout.  The game shows this opening cutscene showing you what happens at the begging of the movie but then it quickly jumps back to about a little over a month before the huge meeting and tells of how the Warriors went from no name to big time. The game starts you off as a new recruit in gang called Rembrandt. You take control of him and have to fight to prove your fit for the gang. This acts as the games tutorial teaching you the ways of the fist. But you won\\'t just play as him. Throughout the game you\\'ll play end up playing as all of the Warriors in various missions, but they all really just play the same. For a game based so much on beating everyone to a pulp the combo system is very simple. But maybe that\\'s a good thing. When you fight your really just rely on whatever combos you feel comfortable using. But it\\'s good to know that while the fighting system is simple, it never gets repetitive or tedious. The game does a good job of making you feel like your a powerhouse and can take on anyone. Every punch or kick you land makes a devastating blow and the screen tends to shake just a tad. This adds a sense of realism to the fights. Missions in the game do repeat. Every mission your either sneaking through to a location, having to steal things, or beating up everyone. You won\\'t really notice this, nor will you care, because the game is just so much fun and the story will keep you wanting to trek forward and see what happens next.Speaking of the story this game has one of the best stories in any game. This is all thanks to the perfect voice acting and deep character development.  The Warriors isn\\'t a terribly long game. It will take you 10 to 12 hours to make it through the main game. But as you progress you unlock flashback missions that tell of how the Warriors gang got started and where it got all it\\'s members. There are around 5 or so of these missions and they add even more back story and character development. They also last upwards of 30 minutes to an hour a piece to they add even more length to the game. The game also has a Rumble Mode were you create your own gang from members of others and take them to the streets to fight other gangs. This mode is fun and you\\'ll probably come back to it a few times just to beat some people up. There is also a Double Dragons style side scroller that is pretty fun to play but really won\\'t keep you coming back to play.  Graphically The Warriors looks ugly. Textures are washed out and the characters hair uses some of the lowest polygon count seen in a game. But all this adds to the dark and gritty atmosphere the game is going for and it nails it. This is one of the most atmospheric games ever made. But with all this praise there are some faults. The loading times are pretty long and it\\'s a pain that the game has to load every time you die or mess up a mission. There are a few really frustrating parts in the game that will keep you dying and it\\'s a pain that it\\'s got the load the whole level over again every time you fail. Also, while the sound is great sometimes it will cut out or not even play at all. It doesn\\'t help that the camera moves quickly and frequently during the course of the game and the PSP screen tends to smear things when it does this. It doesn\\'t happen too often but it happens enough to where you\\'ll notice it. The games combo system isn\\'t really specular either.  But all in all The Warriors is a great beat em\\' up with a great story and any PSP owner should add to there collection. If you never got the chance to play this on the consoles then the PSP version is well worth your time.',\n",

The over the shoulder aiming mechanic improves the game so much and the selection of weapons is truly staggering (maybe there might be too many weapons). The story wraps up any question you could have about the series and provides a satisfiying ending which a lot of entertainment products nowadays cannot seem to emulate. MGS4 is an excellent example of what the PS3 can do in graphics, sound and gameplay. The only annoying thing about the game is the install after every act. If you are a Metal Gear fan you must buy this game, new people to the series may feel a little lost but still you cannot miss out on an experience like this. ',\n",

       "  'description': \"Mortal Kombat has been around for a long time. It's a cultural icon and was responsible for the creation of the ESRB. This is because the game is full of gore and people love games with lots of gore. Not to mention the Fatalities are some of the coolest deaths in any game. But Mortal Kombat Armageddon doesn't have the coolness factor that the previous games have.  The first thing that makes this game fail is it's controls. Specifically the Wiimote and Nunchuk attachment. To do your special moves you must hold down the B button and move the Wiimote to the left, right, up, down, or do half circle movement to do the attacks. This might sound easy but getting them to work is a chore. They don't register well and you'll do the movement over and over again just to get it to work once. So instead of wasting time trying to do a special move you can punch and kick. These are mapped to the D-pad on the Wiimote. This is very awkward to do and it's not ideal.  But never fear because the Classic Controller and the GameCube controller are both supported. But using either one completely defeats the purpose of playing this game on the Wii. It just becomes the PS2 and Xbox versions of the game minus online play and it looks worse than either of those version too.  The games combat system is just flat out pathetic. You've got your simple stock standard punches and kicks, then you've got your grapple moves and special moves. You can't string different combos together either. So it's just basic button mashing mixed in with some special moves making the fighting extremely unsatisfying.  There are over 60 characters in the game. You start out with all of them with only 4 available to unlock. All the character play the same with the exception of a select few. Every single character that has ever been in a Mortal Kombat game is playable.  What the Wii version has that the other versions don't (other than the Wii controls) is an Endurance mode. This mode has been in just about every single fighting game known to man and MK has just got around to putting it in there games it seems. This mode is exactly how you would expect it to be. You fight until your die.  Other than your basic Arcade modes and versus modes there is a mode called Konquest. In this mode you take control of an incredibly generic character by the name of Taven. This mode plays like a really bad flash game that you would play on the internet. The combat is bland and the story is at best forgettable.There is also another Kart racer called Motor Kombat. It's a small distraction and isn't anything special.  Mortal Kombat Armageddon is a average game at best. It's nothing revolutionary and there are defiantly better fighting games out there with better controls, deeper fighting systems, and better differentiation between the characters. To put it simply, this game isn't what you think it is and it's worth a rental if you feel the need to play.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'It just seems like a massive undertaking to write about this game because of all my wildly diverse opinions about it. It’s not cut and dry like most other games or even the other Metal Gears. This one is just fundamentally different in a lot of ways that made it difficult to try to pull it all together in a cohesive review that informs people of my opinion. Even now I’m afraid that this post might be a little scatterbrained, as well. Well, first of all, there’s the thing that I just could not get over though the duration of the game which is the raw amount of care and effort that obviously went into the game. I mean, I’ve talked before about how Naughty Dog, Square, and more recently Ninja Theory and Sony for Heavenly Sword, I’ve talked about the facial animations and cutscenes and how they’re the best in the business. I’m talking from a technical point of view, since I really would have a hard time saying that the ridiculous crystals and stuff in Square games really make for some compelling entertainment. Well, I have to say that in that same vein, ignoring content, MGS4 is up there as well with some of the best animation in the business. You can tell how much motion capture they did, especially in the ridiculous amounts of action scenes. Some of this effort actually goes to waste, though, because despite how well done the cutscenes are, they need to be less of them and they need to be shorter. I understand that Metal Gear and Japanese game fans love these kinds of cutscenes, and I’m sure they’re sick of these damn Western game fans with their integrated narrative trying to ruin their enjoyment of gaming. Hey, I like cutscenes, too and I don’t want them to go. I like Metal Gear cutscenes, too. I just don’t like the gratuity. Raiden’s fight with Vamp is cool, Meryl and Johnny’s Mr. and Mrs. Smith action was cool, and I kind of enjoy some of the psychobabble in the cutscenes, but I’m afraid Kojima Productions needs some guys from cinema to tell them how to edit it into something that’s the right length, because that shit was looooong. I complain about this in some movies as well, like the later two Matrix movies, which had fights that were too long with not enough memorable moments. And some of these goddamn cutscenes have narration over the equivalent of a PowerPoint presentation where they explain, in detail, all the different bodily functions that the Sons of the Patriots system tracks, or every detail of how the Patriots were formed, which I did want to find out in this game but not through a powerpoint! I was so incredibly disappointed when this happened, for someone so creative as Kojima to fail so hard and resort to such a boring method of storytelling. But I guess he couldn’t figure out how to explain everything in another way, or maybe it’s a culture thing where Japan loves PowerPoint or something. I don’t remember on which podcast I heard this, it might have been GFW, 1UP, or Giant Bomb, but someone said that Kojima really made this game to try to wrap everything up which is why everything is so overexplained. That really has to be why he put so much talking in the game, so much more than any other game in the series, even. The game itself is just as you’d remember it. From prerelease information I was led to believe it would be a completely different game and in a way it is, but it’s still the same old Metal Gear, with the different areas you’ve come to remember from the original MSX versions, the exclamation points and alerts, the X button crawling, everything. But it’s amazing that they made all the right choices to make it so fun. It has the Subsistence camera, with some new over the shoulder view and a workable first person view that isn’t quite as good as Call of Duty’s iron sights but it’s close enough for a Japanese dev, and those things fix the problems with enemies in the series, so now Snake feels like the badass he always was. There’s the Splinter Cell crouch walk which comes in more handy than you’d realize, and finally Octocamo. The way this system had been explained led me to think it was some kind of radical new approach but really it’s a logical future tech version of the camo system from MGS3. Instead of finding camo, camo finds you. You can even run the camo system in the same way by registering patterns, which I never found useful at all, but I’m sure it’s there for a reason. The first few levels are a joy to play through. The middle east environment from the trailers has some parts where there’s an open battlefield to sneak through. Contrary to what I understood from prerelease info, you can’t choose sides with the rebels and PMCs. Basically, you can ignore the fights or help the rebels and that’s it, and there’s level paths for both. Snake can run through the center of the battle and lay waste to his enemies or take the road under the car and behind the building to sneak around them. I always help the rebels out by tranquilizing the PMCs, which nets you more items to sell for the in game store. Drebin, a newcomer to the series, sells weapons that you can access through the menu. It’s typical of the series to have gun porn, but there’s an extra layer with the customizability. It’s not as deep as I imagined it was. From what I can see, some weapons have spaces for flashlights or suppressors, grenade launchers or laser sights, those sorts of things. You can’t really go into it any further than that, which is kind of disappointing, but the shop itself is a great idea. It’s no longer about what you find on the battlefield since ammunition is a click away. It also scales well on different difficulties as there’s items you can and can’t buy, and the ammo storage is much smaller as you go up. The one thing that anyone can probably tell about this game is that it’s fanservice. The bosses are all throwbacks to the original Playstation game, you return to Shadow Moses in Act 4, and folks from the previous games in the series return, in some cases even from beyond the grave. It wraps up all the story, every character, and there’s no bad ending in sight. And it’s a little bit of a disappointment. I never expected Kojima to lean so heavily on MGS1, especially in his fourth wall breaking gags which almost always have to do with the first game in some regard. I loved when we return to MGS1 gameplay which hammers home how the series and maybe gaming as a whole has changed in ten years. I still love the gags, which include a Psycho Mantis return complete with attempted memory card telepathy and controller telekinesis, Otacon asking Snake to change the disc in Shadow Moses, things like that. It’s sad not to see anything new there, but really, does the audience want something completely new in MGS4 or do they want to remember the beginning of Solid Snake’s story as the end approaches? I’m thinking the latter. Also disappointing was the ending, which I alluded to before. Not the ending cutscene with Big Boss’s return, which was really long and terrible, but what happened before that. Solid Snake goes through microwaves which should have killed him, collapses on the ground, then fights Liquid who is really Ocelot, then tries to off himself again later with the gun in the mouth, as we saw in one of the trailers so long ago. So many moments to end Solid Snake and put a fine point on the end of the series, and they take none of them. Instead, the ending is too upbeat and weak with all this ridiculousness. Snake should have died after walking through the microwaves. The fight should not have happened. I’m sure they could have Liquid show up while Snake is dying and get killed by FOXDIE or something. The scene with Big Boss should not have happened. Or possibly they could have written it a different way than I’m suggesting. But Solid Snake should have died in an epic way, which is something his story deserved instead of what actually happened I always feel like I need to hammer home various points in my reviews and/or impressions, considering this is the internet which is full of miscommunication. I want to repeat that I really liked this game. There’s a lot of good in this game, some very nice choices of design like the microwave corridor scene which was incredibly effective as interactive entertainment, with “interactive” being the operative word there. There’s also bad parts, but the bad don’t dilute the good. They’re still genius even if there’s PowerPoints in some cutscenes. It’s just disappointing that they couldn’t give Snake the ending he deserved, and it kind of bums me out a little bit.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Bully is one of the most entertaining games ever made. Why this is is fairly apparent. It's a Rockstar game that plays like GTA and who better than to rip off GTA than Rockstar themselves? But that's not what Bully is all about. Sure, it's another open world game and that's been done a million times before but that's beside the point. Bully offers an experiance that many other games strive for but fail to accomplish. It offers an engaging story that will keep you playing just to see what will happen next and who in the wonderful cast of characters you'll be able to trade punches with. It also offers up the tried and true gameplay that has made Rockstar one of the most beloved and recognizable game developers out there.   You play as a 15 year old boy named Jimmy Hopkins. He's been expelled from multiple schools and his mother has been remarried more than five times. It's apparent Jimmy has had a rough life and he copes with it by beating people up and acting like a real delinquent. His mother has gotten married yet again and she and her new husband dump Jimmy off at a boarding school know has Bullworth Academy forgetting he even exists in the process.  Bully is a misleading name. You don't play as a bully (although you can if you so choose) but rather you go out of your way to stop all the bullying at Bullworth. Within the first few minutes of the game you see what kind of a school Bullworth really is and Jimmy wants to clean it up. Along the way you'll meet an amazing cast of characters that feel real and alive within the game. You'll meet Algernon, the nerd who frequently wets himself; Gary, the boy you come to trust but soon realize is a maniac only out for himself; and many others who all of which are perfectly voiced by a talented cast of actors.  Your in an open world were you can do pretty much anything you feel like doing. Want to beat up a teacher? Well go right ahead. How about skipping class? You have the choice to do so. But keep in mind that doing such things does come at a price. School prefects will chase you down and if you don't get away or find a place to hide then there will be trouble. The first couple of times your caught you'll just get a slap on the hand, but if you continue to misbehave then it's off to detention with you.   During your term at Bullworth you can attend classes. Scholarship Edition adds new classes that were not found in the original game. Those are Math, Geography, Biology, and Music class. All of the original classes from the initial release also make a return in the form of Art, Gym, Shop, English, Chemistry, and Photography. Classes play out like minigames and are generally fun. In Chemistry you'll be doing button presses as they scroll across the screen to mix chemicals akin to San Andreas's dancing minigames, English class will have you making word out of jumbled letters, and so on. You'll want to attend classes not only because they are fun, but because they reward you with new moves, and skills that are essential to game progression.   There are also eight new missions added to Scholarship Edition. None of them are terribly exciting but if you've played the game on the PS2 then they'll stick out as something new. Most of them take place during Christmas time and as such have a Christmas theme to them. You'll help a bum who thinks honest to God thinks he Santa teach some punk kids a lesson and you'll also help him take out the rival Santa so kids will come to him for their Christmas photos.   Bully takes place over 5 distinct chapters. Each has it's own feel and theme. In chapter one you'll work your way up to the leader of the bullies and take him out making all of the bullies respect you. The same happens in chapter two through four with you taking out the leaders of each clique. The story in the game is a bit predictable but not in a particularly bad way. It's all satisfying and extremely exciting.  Bully has gotten a bit of an upgrade graphically since it's outing on the PS2. The lighting has been improved and doesn't make the game look so dark. Character models have also been somewhat improved. But even with the improvements Bully still looks like a last gen game. It also suffers from frequent crashes and a lot of framerate issues. So take this into consideration if you plan on buying the 360 version. A patch has been released and with it installed I only encountered a game crash once and it was halfway through the game.   All in all Bully is an amazing experience that you shouldn't miss. It was a classic in 2006 and it's still a classic now.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Ninja Gaiden 2 is one of the best action games I have ever played. The game plays like no other game and has a very simple but engaging story to boot with some great characters including some of the most evil people I've ever seen grace a video game. From the likes of Elizabet and the other fiends to Genshin (quite possibly the biggest bad ass in any video game) to the good guys of the game which include Ryu Hayabusa and Sonya the beautiful and buxom CIA agent who accompanies Ryu on his journey.   As a first time entree into the Ninja Gaiden series I was instantly blown away by the depth of combat and sheer brutality behind every single movement the protagonist of the game, Ryu Hayabusa, engages himself in. Everything about this game has a certain style of it, brutal yet somewhat tasteful despite the fact limbs and heads fly aplenty. Ninja Gaiden 2 has perhaps one of the best combat systems used in any game ever made and that's quite the bold statement. The combat system is easy to get used to, on acolyte one can get away with simply button mashing the strong attack on most of the early levels. Of course though you have to learn to master the combo attacks as well as timing and general strategies especially when it comes to boss battles. Ninja Gaiden does what many action games fails to do, it makes sure the player can't get away with mashing away at random buttons in hopes of beating a level. The tight control scheme allows players to feel in total control and this is the most satisfying thing about the game, it's the fact nothing is handed to you. You have to work towards everything and every single movement is controlled by you. If you fail it's because you didn't do well that round and you had room for improvement. The game never falls into the boundary of cheap regardless of what any reviewer will say. Chances are they just weren't good at the game. By no means am I a master ninja but there I'd like to think I am somewhat skilled at this game. Ninja Gaiden will do that to people, being able to beat such a tough game is enough to make anybody brimming with pride. Thanks to Ninja Gaiden's tight control scheme, and it's easy to pick up but hard to master gameplay Ninja Gaiden 2 has some of the best action gameplay to be experienced in any video game.  Itagaki didn't lie about this game being the world's best action game because as I explained it's gameplay is unrivaled. Sadly he somewhat lied when he talked about the graphics. Graphics are the major weak point of this game and really held it back from being a universally AAA game and in my books held it back from earning a 9.5. There are many inconsistencies in graphics. The early levels look mediocre, nothing special at all in these levels. The couple levels in the middle such as the jungle level look downright junky especially that infamous green tunnel. That looks terrible to be quite blunt. The later levels though blew me away and look truly beautiful. These levels were definitely more polished then the rest of the levels in the game and have beautiful lighting effects, coloring, and they just look fantastic and strike a sense of awe when you first see them. The character models all look fine to me nothing really ugly but nothing amazing. The physics that went into the female characters breasts never cease to amaze me, typical Itagaki ;). The best place where the graphics are put to use is the amazing action sequences which look amazing and never cease to amaze. Onlookers and players alike will be amazed by the acrobatics of Ryu and the gory outcomes of these battles. These are truly battles that are not to be missed.  The sound in the game is great if you know what to do. The music is excellent and sets an appropriate mood, there is the typical action game music. There is boss music, combat music, and atmosphere music. Nothing new is done but what is done is done extremely well and I quite enjoyed it. The dialogue to me sounded stupid in English so with some simple changes I changed the dialogue to Japanese with English subtitles. As with most things this made the game much more pleasant to the ears as this was the way the game was meant to be heard. I recommend you do this because it simply sounds better and the acting is a lot more believable.   Ninja Gaiden 2 is well worth the 59.99, despite it being a single player game there is a lot of replay value in the game as the difficulty levels present a new challenge and what feels like a new game every time. In a sense this game is kind of like the 'Guitar Hero' of action games where once you beat one difficulty level you have to do the next one. There is also a lot of fun to be had with the leader board in which you can compare your ninja skills with your friends. Ninja Gaiden 2 is a blast and a game not to be missed. It will challenge you and you will be amazed. If you are on the fence, just check out the demo. If you think you like action games you should slap yourself if you think to avoid this game.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Finishing Metal Gear Solid 4 was an overwhelming experience for me. It\\'s flawless in meshing story and game-play together – something that the series had been superb at doing, but has now perfected. This game should not be passed up. Unless you hate good games of course. Graphics – 10/10: Just because this game looked good in previews YEARS ago, doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s good to today\\'s standards, right? You couldn\\'t be more wrong. Metal Gear Solid 4 is a landmark in visual presentation. There are almost NO pop-ins, barely any blurry textures, and all at a consistent frame-rate. I was playing on an SDTV, and it still looked stunning. I was in constant fear that my PS3 would EXPLODE from the amount of things it was rendering, but it held together very nicely.    Game-play – 9.5/10: Metal Gear Solid used to be (in my eyes) about 75% stealth, 25% action. In MGS4, I would say it\\'s now 60% stealth, 40% action. Of course, you could go a hundred percent stealth, save for some action and boss sequences, but given the number of options for weapons, battle moves, and such, it\\'s hard to avoid stealth.  Stealth is still the primal focus of the game, as you are urged to avoid conflict against an almost unlimited number of baddies. The controls are also tweaked to allow slighter movements in order to achieve the stealth you want.  A new game-play mechanic is the octo-camo. On default settings, your suit will blend into the ground/wall you are pressed up against. This means easy camouflage for patient people.   If you\\'re not the stealthy type, there\\'s always the option to gun everything in sight. A weapons wholesaler named Drebin will supply you with a huge barrage of weapons, ammo, and customizations for the price of what\\'s called \"Drebin Points.\" Any doubles of guns you find automatically get cashed in as Drebin points. Essentially, you get Drebin points for each kill because almost every enemy will drop a valuable weapon. Unfortunately, the weapons you find will be \"ID Tagged\". This means that since the gun doesn\\'t belong to you, it will lock and not work. This is also where Drebin comes in to \"launder\" the guns to be useful to you.  The shooting mechanics are very well tuned, and the draw distance is so great, you could actually pick off enemies from afar with a pistol if your aim is good enough. There is an optional lock on system, but the game seems more \"free\" without it.  You may have heard of the \"psyche\" and \"stress meters\". Essentially, when your stress meter goes up from firing your gun a lot, being near explosions, etc, your psyche will go down. You end up ignoring these meters for the lower difficulties, as they are nothing more than a nuisance next to your always-viewed life meter. Nothing in MGS4 stays constant, which brings about a perfect pace. Just when you start to have the SLIGHTEST feeling of \"jeez, I wish I\\'d do something else\", the game changes pace with other game styles which I shouldn\\'t spoil here.  Since I can\\'t definitively talk about the battles you will have due to the changing pace of things, I can however tell you that the boss fights are EPIC. I cannot stress how awesome the game is.  Any negatives? Well, the triangle button is used for most  of your actions, which leads to accidentally pressing it for something you didn\\'t want to do. But mainly, it\\'s the players\\' fault for not paying attention. The difficulty is perfect with amazing environments. Rolling sideways while reloading would have been awesome too.  Not enough can be said. It\\'s just too hard to describe all of the joys of MGS4. One note: Try to play with a DualShock 3. The game really takes advantage of the feature.   Sound – 10/10: I don\\'t have a sound system, but the game still sounded like heaven. Every explosion is crazy. Every line of dialogue is solid gold. The voice acting actually matches with the mouth synching (a first for MGS games) and the music is top notch. You will have access to an iPod which will enable you to find and pick up old MGS music to listen on the go. This brings back many nostalgic memories which will bring forth many emotions. I look for sound-effects, voice acting, and music when it comes to sound. Metal Gear Solid 4 surpasses my expectations for those categories.   Value – 10/10: Why the hell wouldn\\'t you want to play this? (unless you don\\'t have a PS3) When you finish the incredibly lengthy main story, you can play it again for the hundreds of easter-eggs and secrets. Finished with that? There\\'s a full fledged multiplayer game called Metal Gear Online which is (pun intended) solid. The game is pretty balanced and would do great even without being packaged with MGS4. You should be paying Konami more for this game, but for 60 bucks, what are you waiting for?   Story – \"an amazing conclusion to this amazing series\" Every character, every opened piece of plot, every theme is revisited in this game. Kojima may have said that you would understand the game without prior knowledge, but it\\'s clear that this game\\'s plot was mainly for the fans of the series. There are so many magical moments of nostalgia that it will haunt you for days to come. Story too complicated? SUCK IT UP. I don\\'t think this counts as a negative at all. More like a positive thing if you ask me. I love Metal Gear Solid as the melodramatic piece of art it is. I love how the story gives you every emotion it has. It is a truly magical story, but honestly better for fans.    CONCLUSION: We are beasts created by man. Unless the light is put out, the shadows cannot be erased. So long as there is light, erasing shadows will do no good.                                    -Ocelot   Graphics - 10/10 Game-play - 9.5/10 Sound - 10/10 Value - 10/10 Story - \"an amazing conclusion to this amazing series\" OVERALL – 5 STARS',\n",

       "  'description': 'Mario\\'s latest romp on the Wii won\\'t disappoint long time fans. All the old features of Super Mario we have come to love over the years are still here along with a few new twists for fans and newcomers alike.Super Mario Galaxy is one of those games Wii owners have been waiting for, and it is finally here. Mario\\'s latest adventure starts off the way we\\'ve come to expect. Bowser whisks away Peach and you must give chase. Only this time, Mario finds himself plucked out of the Mushroom Kingdom and flown across the Galaxy to save his Princess. After a brief tutorial to get you acquainted to the Wii controls, you\\'re dropped off on the Observatory which serves as a hub for every other level, much like Delfino Plaza and Peach\\'s Castle in the previous two Super Mario titles. From here you are tasked with retrieving the Grand Stars in order to repair and refuel the Observatory so that you can sail to the center of the universe and save Peach from Bowser. But this is a Super Mario game, you knew the plot before you even looked at the box.In Mario\\'s latest adventure, he travels to various Galaxies from the six themed domes in the main Observatory collecting stars in order to access newer galaxies and Grand Stars, used to access new domes. The general flow of the recent batch of Mario games hasn\\'t been altered: go to world, collect as many stars as you can, go to newly unlocked worlds, rinse and repeat until your Bowser-related confrontation that invariably leads to unlocking a new zone. What is different is that when you arrive at a Galaxy, you land on a small planet which will have some kind of objective (as well as its own gravity to keep you glued on..usually) that you\\'ll have to complete in order to get to the next planet until you build your way to a star. Some levels are classic Mario platforming. Jump from Point A to Point B smashing baddies and avoiding falling to your doom (which happens to be a black hole just under whatever you\\'re working on. Others are more in line with more recent Mario adventures- Race this guy, help that guy and so on until you get a reward.But wait, this game is on the Wii, so we\\'ve got to talk controls. Your basic jumping and moving around is all handled with the appropriate buttons and analog sticks, but with the pointer that is drawn on screen, you can pull Mario to certain types of star icons in order to progress through a level, or by moving the controller, you can execute some of Mario\\'s move repetoire (or in the case of launch stars, activate them). It might take a little adjusting and getting used to, but it works and becomes intuitive very quickly. \"But what about this Co-star mode it talks about on the back of the box!?\" Yes, lo and behold, you can get a friend to play with you in this installment of Super Mario. Having a friend around and tossing them a wiimote will allow them to shoot at enemies with star bits that you collect as Mario, or if you and your friend give Mario the command to jump at about the same time, he will jump higher. Mainly it is for messing around- there isn\\'t any need to have a second person around, but it\\'ll give your friend something to do while you\\'re busy obsessing over this latest adventure, or it\\'ll let you help out a sibling/relative as they learn to play Mario\\'s latest adventure.Visually, Super Mario Galaxy looks like a little more polished version of Super Mario Sunshine. The environments spacially (forgive the pun) are probably larger than in sunshine generally speaking, but the actual explorable area is probably about the same. Sound direction at the same time is what we\\'ve come to expect with Mario\\'s recent adventures, filled with memorable remixes of classic songs as well as new tunes to enjoy. It sounds and looks like a Mario game, what else is there to say?My main complaint is that the difficulty is a little bit sporatic. For those people who will invariably go after every star in the game, you may find yourself in the same place I was in- getting frustrated over stars that will cause your demise time and time again because of a timer or inane requirement. But why is this? Well, many of the extra stars in Super Mario Galaxy are obtained from comets- which are basically trial/challenge runs of a star you have already gotten as well as one comet which is always a coin hunt. These challenges are set by which type it is- some require you to beat an objective in under a certain time limit, others require you to beat a boss or a segment of a level without taking any damage while others are the races against your shadow-self. These challenges will range from very easy, to excruciatingly annoying. I never found one that was genuinely hard, but several that I had to repeat many times because of a short timelimit or troublesome level design. Don\\'t worry though, there are a couple genuinely \"hidden\" stars to be obtained, but the 100-coin star has been nixed this time around. Super Mario Galaxy is the Nintendo title we\\'ve been waiting for on the Wii and it won\\'t disappoint. There are a few secret features there for the adventurous that collect all 120 Stars, but I won\\'t spoil those here. Whether you\\'re new to the Mario series or a veteran, there is definitely a game here to enjoy. ',\n",

       "  'description': 'A lot of the time when a major console game makes the transition to a handheld it often turns out as a completely different game or it takes place as a side story or a spin-off. This is apparent with games such as Vice City Stories and the Metal Gear Acid games. But this isn\\'t the case with Ratchet and Clank: Size Matters. In fact it\\'s almost the exact same as the console versions. It\\'s a direct sequel to Deadlocked and picks the story up from there. Ratchet and Clank are on vacation and a little girl comes up to them wanting to take pictures of them doing \"heroic\" stuff. She gets kidnapped and they have to go save her. The story has many twists and turns but ultimately is pretty forgettable.  The PSP is notorious for not have a second analog stick and because of this Size Matters controls feel a little sloppy. The camera is one problem. It has two different options, with one you use both shoulder buttons to move the camera to the left and right. This one feels the best and is the one that I recommend you use while playing. The other option makes the camera stick behind Ratchet at all times and when you move, the camera moves with you. It works for the most part but in the end it\\'s more annoying than helpful. You strafe in the game by pressing left and right on the d-pad. This actually works very well and you\\'ll have to circle strafe some bosses to beat them as it\\'s almost the only way too, so the d-pad will quickly become your best friend in fights.  The game plays pretty much the exact same as the PS2 versions. You travel through extremely linear levels on a couple of different planets blowing things up on your way to the end. Helping your blow up these things up are your trusty guns. There are a little over a dozen in the game and the more you use them the more experience they gain leading to them leveling up. All the guns are fun to use and helpful in eliminating the bad guys, but there is one gun in particular that is like a shotgun and it misses almost every time you shoot it making it pretty much worthless. There are boxes strewn about the levels and breaking them will give you bolts. Bolts is the games currency and you use them to buy new guns and gun mods. You also gain armor in the game. There are different types that you can equip and customize your appearance. Equipping certain parts will give you attack boosts such as making your wrench catch on fire that takes down double damage or if your throw your wrench you\\'ll leave a trail of acid that will hurt enemies that walk across it. But you\\'ll mainly only use the armor as a defensive upgrade and rely more on your guns for attacking.  Size Matters isn\\'t a particularly long game. It\\'s around the 5 to 8 hour mark. However, once you beat the game you can go through it again on \"challenge\" mode that gives you bolt multipliers to get you more bolts and there is a new set of armor available for you to find. There are also races to partake in and Twisted Metal style Clank mini games to play. You can also play multiplayer matches to up to 4 people online and off. But the multiplayer is pretty uninteresting and you probably won\\'t play it that much.  Ratchet and Clank: Size Matters is a great PSP game. It\\'s got everything you love about the PS2 games but it\\'s in the palm of your hand. If your a fan of Ratchet and Clank you should defiantly pick it up although the $40 price tag is asking a little to much for a such a short game. But regardless of all that this game is worth your time.',\n",

       " {'deck': 'Saints Row is a game that had a lot of potential...',\n",
       "  'description': \"Had the Grand Theft Auto games never existed it's proper to say that Saints Row could have been one of the best games released on the Xbox 360. Sadly Grand Theft Auto does exist and you can't help but see where Saints Row gets most of it's gameplay from. Sadly Saints Row is nothing but a cheap copy of Grand Theft Auto with a cut down story, annoying and repetitive activities and the same old clunky combat Grand Theft Auto  suffered from in the past. If one was to not compare this game to Grand Theft Auto it'd score an easy 8.5-9.0 but with games like GTA IV and Vice City out there, this game simply does not stand a chance.   The graphics in Saints Row are mediocre at best. While the game goes for a more comic book style of graphics it really looks like a last generation game on the 360. The character models aren't very impressive and nothing really stands out. For the most part the graphics in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas were actually on par with this game. There really isn't any more then this to be said about the graphics. The presentation of the game is mediocre, the city has an alright feel but it hardly compares to the environments seen in other free roam games. Nothing really feels alive and everything feels as if it was just thrown in there and has no purpose. I always see the same things too around the city and every part of the city looks the same. The sound in the game is mediocre as well. The dialogue is corny and lazily written and the sound effects sound dated at this point. The radio stations are alright but it's obvious they tried to copy the wit and humor of Grand Theft Auto's radio station, this is a miserable failure.   The story and game play of Saints Row can be summed up with one word by one word for both, Abysmal and Alright. First off there is no story in the game, don't come here expecting an epic tale of redemption and revenge. Rather come expecting a game that is just a glorified version of the gang wars you get in San Andreas. The story begins with your custom made character caught in a firefight which ignites a city wide gang war. You are taken in by the Third Street Saints and you essentially go through the gang trying to take out the other gangs and control the city. Other then this there is no story in the game. The game play is mediocre, the driving feels good and is easy to control but the combat is clunky. It's alright and does the job but it can be very tedious. Activities are an annoying addition to the game play formula. Personally I hated doing the same repetitive tasks in order to get respect. Sadly this is not a choice activity but rather it's mandatory if you want to advance through the game. Don't expect to find anything new that's worth checking out here.  What did I like about this game? The only things in this game that were excellent were the amount of customization. I really liked making my own character and dressing him however I wanted. Cars are also very customizable which is cool to see. There is also a lot of fun to be had doing some of the activities notably Mayhem and Insurance Fraud, the rest on the other hand were just boring like the escort missions for instance. Another good thing about the game was it had decent mission variety, it's not just kill this and that but sometimes you get to do different things like masquerade yourself as a limo driver to get to your victim to go under cover as the rival gang and cause mayhem. Sadly some of this mission variety is ruined by frustratingly difficult missions which happen randomly.   All in all Saints Row is a mediocre game and really was intended only to be build up for the eventual release of GTA IV. If you're really tired of GTA IV give this game a rent to see if you like it. If you're a GTA fan expecting to find something new don't bother. Just go back to Vice City or San Andreas, you'll have a lot more fun.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Halo 3 is one of those games people love to hate. It's up there in the league of World of Warcraft and Grand Theft Auto where it's considered to be somewhat trendy to express your hate of the game whether you even played it or not. I admit that as a hardcore PC gamer for a long time I hated my fair share on Halo despite being a huge fan of the original when it made its debut on the PC platform all those years back. I have to say one thing though, Halo 3 is simple fun and to put it simply this game is a blast to play and some of the most fun I've had in a while with any game.   Technologically, Halo 3 is 'good'. The graphics look great in some parts and mediocre in others. The graphics really aren't the big attraction to the game though. They look good and that is all I ever asked for. The characters models of the Spartans and Elites look good in multi-player and single player but the other character models namely your comrades look simply 'o.k'. I have no gripe with the graphics though, the effects in the games look nice and your weapons all look great when you wield them. Halo 3 though is not the graphical achievement that Halo 1 or 2 was though at their time.   As far as gameplay though Halo 3 is as simple as it gets, luckily this is done to a perfection almost. The vehicles and shooting play is just plain fun to do and it's especially great when you are online or playing co-op with a friend. Piling into a vehicle and shooting things may not sound like a blast on paper but trust me it's one of the best experiences I've had while gaming. Simple truly does taste better when it comes to playing Halo 3.   Halo 3 has a beefy single player as well a very good multi-player. The single player campaign is very fun and there is good variety in it. They make sure that by the end of the game you'll use every vehicle, every gun, and everything there is to do in the game. Collecting skulls and achievements encourage play throughs of the games. With friends the Halo 3 campaign is amazing and great fun. It's a bit short sure but what FPS these days isn't. The multi-player is the strongest part of Halo 3. With double XP weekends and very fun ranked and socials playlists, you'll be playing this for a long time. The ranking system is very good as well as the customization you can put into your armor. There is also hardcore playlists for those who are looking to compete with the MLG and other leagues. Though there are some people in the community who are less then fun to play with, most of the people in the game are great people and I have had great experiences playing with them. It's not hard to meet a friendly group of guys to team up with and play ranked team games with. The bad eggs in the community are quite exaggerated.  Overall, Halo 3 is a very fun game and you'll quite enjoy it I assure you. I don't even follow the Halo story but the campaign was great. The multi-player will last for hundreds of hours if you let it and the game is simple and fun to play. Anyone with a 360 owes it to themselves to buy this game since it's just plain great.\",\n",

The career decisions was the main focus of Mass Effect, so likewise, everything in the galaxy revolves around your decisions, which were beautifully mirrored by Commander Shepard. People say that there's a Commander Shepard in all of us, well I think there's a little part of all of in Shepard, whether you want to be heartless in your quest to save the universe or you want to do things like a noble knight in shining armor, it's completely up to you. It wont feel like a chore to finish missions and talk to people to find out information on your target, ME is designed to hook you into the story, you'll want to find out about what's going on and you'll want to save the universe, but the real beauty is that Bioware lets you decide how you go about doing those things.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Technically concerned, Mass Effect has not disappointed. The view of the greenery in the Cathedral or the shadow of a distant moon is captivating to say the absolute least. There are some bugs to be concerned about, not too much as none of them (which I have encountered) are game-breaking. Just graphical hiccups here and there will stop you momentarily, and by momentarily I mean a few short seconds, and it will put you right back in the action.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The action is something Bioware gambled on, because when you think about RPG games, the first thing to pop is, well, how am I going to get the thrill of an Action based game from an RPG while still keeping it strategic? Bioware answered this question with a clear intent of giving the players, once again, the power of choice. With the new time-stopping ability, in the heat of the battle, you can get a 360 degree view of your battlefield and decide how you want to go about solving this puzzle, that is, if you look at it from the RPG side. But no, you just want to run and gun, well go ahead, dont stop time at all, just equip your solider with rounds of fire that'll burn the enemies literally into oblivion.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The reason why Mass Effect isn't a 5 star game isn't because Bioware didn't quite come up to par with expectations, it is because Bioware focused so heavily on the exploration of planets via the Mako (galactic humvee) and all exploration was virtually only possible through the Mako that the whole exploration concept got rotten because of the broken controls of the Mako. You'd think the future super cruiser would have a cannon that can point downward right? Well, the Alliance ran out of funds so your stuck with this piece of junk which indeed, does make exploration a chore, but an optional one thankfully.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 When you want to find a company that pushes the bar for RPG's, look no further than Bioware and take Mass Effect as it's defendant because ME is a masterpiece of Sci-Fi role-playing, and with the promising Mass Effect trilogy on it's way, Bioware truly is the universal dominator of Action RPG's.The Closure:\\xa0 With one of the best stories in a video game accompanied by beautiful visual excellence. Mass Effect is a must-buy for both RPG and Action game fans that wont disappoint. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \",\n",

Modern Warfare has you play through the single player campaign from 2 different perspectives, for the majority of the campaign you play as Sergeant \"Soap\" MacTavish from the 22nd SAS Regiment and for a segment of the game you take on the roll of Sergeant Paul Jackson who is part of the USMC 1st Force Recon who are deployed to the Middle East.   The story begins with you playing as \"Soap\" you are in a SAS training facility and you\\'re instructed by Gaz a individual you see a lot of throughout the campaign Gaz instructs you through the basic tutorial and sends you off to Captain Price to perform the CQB test. After the test you are thrown straight in to the start of what is a short yet exhilarating single player campaign. The prologue begins with you infiltrating a Cargo Ship in the Bering Sea to secure a Russian Nuclear device destined for the middle east once you fighting your way through all the personnel on board you reach the nuclear device but before you have time to secure the device and transport it off the Ship the cargo ship is struck by missiles from hostile jet fighters you are forced quickly grab the manifest and escape the sinking ship. This is only the start of what is an Exciting, Enthralling and Unpredictable single player campaign.  Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare has one of the best single player campaigns in a long time never has a game been so cinematic and outstanding from the rest and yet this is smallest reason why it\\'s such a great game. Modern Warfare\\'s strongest and greatest feature is its multiplayer. Modern Warfare has a wide variety of game modes including frantic frag fests like Headquarters or game modes which require more skill to succeed in such as Search and Destroy. In multiplayer you start out at level 1 with only a few select weapons and perks available to you. The perk system is a great addition to Modern Warfare as it allows you to design a class which suits you best after a few hours of playing online you will already have found a Weapon and set of perks that suit you best and you wouldn\\'t dream of going back to the normal class set-ups that you start off with. As you progress through the ranks you unlock new weapons and perks the game becomes much more enjoyable as you have better weapons and perks at your disposal and you can really start to get into a groove with your favourite weapons. The levels are capped at 55 but once you reach 55 you have a choice of Prestige mode prestige mode is where you reset your rank to 1 and you are able to gain XP again you can do this up to ten times and effectively rise 605 ranks. A great feature of CoD4s multiplayer is the Kill Streak Bonus\\'s if you are good enough to get 3 kills without dying you can call in UAV radar which allows you to find any of your enemies on the map unless they are using the UAV jammer perk. If you progress to 5 kills you can call in an airstrike on the area of your choice and if you manage to catch 2 people with the airstrike and reach 7 kills without dying you can call in a helicopter which will circle the map and take out enemies for you.  There are 16 maps in total available ranging from fairly large maps such as Pipeline and overgrown to incredibly small maps such as Shipment and Showdown the current maps on offer are all fairly well designed with only a few that need some necessary changes. In spring we will see the release of new MP maps over Xbox Live and PSN which will further add to the amazing experience that is Call of Duty 4 multiplayer.  Modern Warfare takes a drastic change from the previous games in its series and improves on the vastly with outstanding visuals, Enthralling single player and truly amazing multiplayer. If the campaign lasted longer and a few overpowered weapons in multiplayer were balanced out then CoD4 would be a perfect game but still CoD4 is one of the greatest FPSs of all time and should be on the shelf of every gamer.',\n",

       "  'description': \"I'm gonna be honest here, this game SUCKS. On the surface it looks nice (i'm obviously not talking about the grapichs) since at first glimps the story appears to be quite dark and interesting, and you got two unique main characters. When i started the game i thought the controlls were kinda clunky and it just didn't seem entertaining, but i continued to play the game. After completing the first two missions i realised that the game wouldn't get any better, the gameplay just doesn't work, shooting people is not satisfying, infact it's downright boring.I continued to play this boring game since i wanted to see where the story would go. The story went nowhere, that's for sure. The characters don't evolve, they remain dull and grumpy, unlikeable.It's hard for me to see anything interesting in this game. The level design is dull (with some exceptions) the graphics are ugly, characters and story is boring, killing people is not satisfying and it's hard to aim, soundtrack is boring aswell.I know this review is very poorly written, but i just wanted to tell people how bad this game is. I wouldn't recommend Kane and Lynch to anyone, go play Big Rigs instead.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Lets start off with the story on super Mario galaxy. The story in this game is among the best. I love all the stories in Mario when browser steels peach but this one is the best. The whole space idea I thought was great. It had a good story behind it. The story when you had to get enough was great when you had to go into different places and blast off into different levels, which I thought, was interesting.The levels in Super Mario Galaxy are great they put allot of thought into them and they all work out great. There were a lot of obstacles just like plan old Mario and it was great. The suits that Mario wares in this game I thought were interesting some were hard to play with but they were all cool and fit into the levels. The graphics in this game are one of the greatest on the Wii so far.Mario in his new game has some improved moves like he can spin the new double jump back flip and some others. In this game you can collect little gems that lay around all the levels. You can get it by jumping or you can point the Wii remote at the stars and you automatically get them witch was an easier way. I liked how they added the stars I thought it was a great addition. This game really hit the spot when I saw that it was going to be held in space. It was a great idea and a good addition to the series.I liked how in this game every base you go to has its own name and inside it looks like they called it like the kitchen. In this game you have a little star that comes from this base in space that helps you on your journey. He helps you do all your moves like spin and other thing I thought that this idea that it follows you around was cool and I liked it. I like that you can go to the library that when you go in Rosalina is there and tells you a story on how she became to come in space and what here live story was I thought this was interesting and cool to know. Super Mario Galaxy keeps on pulling you in for more action because you always want to see what is going to happen when you collect all the stars even now that you are in space.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Games based on movies rarely hit the mark. Developers are rushed to meet strict movie release deadlines, and on top of that it's difficult to translate a two-hour movie into a longer interactive adventure. By basing Republic Commando on the entire Star Wars prequel trilogy, Lucas Arts had the freedom of adhering to no movie in particular, and created an experience that's enjoyable regardless of your knowledge of the films. The result is a relentlessly entertaining shooter based in the Star Wars universe that will keep you on your toes right up until the credits roll.In Republic Commando, you are the leader of an elite group of Republic clones: the Delta Squad. The Republic needs you and your trio of specialists to complete missions that require the stealth and tact that an entire clone army could not provide. Throughout your various missions you'll shoot your way through many different locations, never visiting the same one twice. You'll have many futuristic weapons at your disposal, ranging from rapid-fire laser guns to crossbows to rocket launchers. Also, as squad leader you're able to use some fairly basic but effective tactical commands. You can tell your three comrades to stake out certain positions, take offensive action, target a specific enemy, or even to heal themselves at designated stations. Thankfully, your allies can make their own simplified decisions during combat as well, and you can focus on the intense fire fights that Republic Commando has to offer.Republic Commando does a great job at creating a sense of urgency and immerses you in your character. The realistic visor on your screen at all times makes you feel like you're looking through the eyes of an actual elite commando. One particularly great visor effect is when you kill an enemy up close and their slimy alien blood splatters all over your visor. Little touches like these make you feel a part of the action. If you happen to get downed by an enemy while your allies are still alive, you can direct them from your incapacitated state to either come and revive you immediately or finish the fight as best they can. Of course, when any of your allies goes down it is your job to either revive them yourself or direct one of the other soldiers to do it for you. As long as one member is still alive, you always have a fighting chance.On top of a well-balanced mixture of action and strategy, you'll have a variety of gnarly weapons to deal some serious damage with throughout your adventure. Your main gun is a rapid-fire laser cannon that you'll use to take out most enemies. As you progress, you'll find useful attachments that transform your standard gun into a variety of different forms including a sniper rifle and a grenade launcher. Along with a large variety of weapons, you'll also have five different types of grenades that all have specialized capabilities. For example, one type of grenade shocks its enemies and works most effectively against robotic droids, while another type stuns non-robotic enemies. The weaponry and types of grenades you use all depend on what kind of enemies you're fighting, and you'll have a lot of fun figuring out which weapons work best in certain situations.None of this would matter if Republic Commando didn't look fantastic. The detailed space environments, convincing and distinct character models, and lifelike animations all bring the Star Wars universe to life on the Xbox. The large spacecraft look especially grand with futuristic metal plating and all sorts of air shafts and hallways to get lost in. The enemies that fill these hallways look lifelike and threatening due to their fluid animations. The flying aliens look especially menacing as they perch on the walls and slowly flap their wings, biding their time until they attack. One particularly memorable animation happens when you shoot off a droid's head and the body continues to shoot around aimlessly before finally keeling over. All of this makes for an immersing atmosphere that unfortunately is interrupted a little too often by a choppy frame rate. When the action gets particularly fierce and you're dealing with a lot of enemies on screen, the frame rate can get dangerously low. However, these moments are usually few and far between and the game looks so good that this flaw is easier to forgive.You'll find convincing voice acting and a great soundtrack in Republic Commando as well. All of your three squad mates have their own distinctive voice and personality that brings their character to life. For example, the sniper of the group is timid while the explosives specialist has a throaty, burly kind of voice. Various ambient sounds like lasers whizzing by and grenades exploding also add to the realism and suspense. As you'd expect, the soundtrack to Republic Commando is epic in stature like that of its movie counterparts. You'll recognize the familiar Star Wars theme in different forms throughout the game, as well as some original music that corresponds well with the action on screen. All of these sounds make Republic Commando a better experience by adding personality and realism to the action.All in all, Republic Commando's single player campaign is extremely entertaining for the eight or so hours it lasts, but you can't help wanting more out of the experience. You can play multiplayer online, but it's fairly simple because there are only two game types. It's clear that Republic Commando was designed as a single player game. Currently most Star Wars fans are playing Battlefront or Battlefront II online, so it's very unlikely you'll even find people to play with. In short, you're far more likely to play the campaign over again than you are to spend any sort of serious time playing this game online. Overall, Republic Commando is a pithy, action-packed adventure that is bound to please any action fan, regardless of his or her opinion of Star Wars.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"One of the greatest highs in modern videogames has to be that first moment when a GTA game hands control over to you, the player. Here's the world... go do some shit. Dizzying stuff, like pouring champagne directly on your brain balls.And in this regard, GTAIV does not disappoint. As you catch your first glimpses of the world of Liberty City through the headlights of Roman Bellic's beat up cab, the\\xa0possibilities\\xa0seem endless. They aren't of course, but much of GTA's thrill has always been what you can imagine doing, rather than what you actually can do. And it's a pretty perfect engine, built for\\xa0mind-blowing, and up to the task at hand.The task at hand is making you feel like you are starring in your own epic crime drama... and you are. And it's ace.Whilst the story never quite comes together in the way you'd hope (without giving away any spoilers... Niko Bellic could have become a definitive and tragic anti-hero by more than just videogame standards if Houser and co. had been a little more brave during one of the plot's key moments) the people you encounter really are as extraordinary as everyone says they are. Amongst the traditional cartoon archetypes there are a handful of characters here that would stand alongside the best of modern crime literature... broken, damaged people that occupy those thrilling grey areas that exist between simple concepts of good and bad.Mechanically, the game is greatly improved over previous efforts but still not up to the standards of its genres (as always, it proves to be a jack of all trades, but a master of none)... and although combat is greatly improved, a twitchy cover mechanic and some over enthusiastic physics here and there go to frustrate as much as innovate.\\xa0The animation however, is something else entirely. The NaturalMotion middleware, although clearly in its infancy here, demonstrates that the way our digital characters interact with the worlds around them is perhaps the next frontier for developers... and serves to make pre-GTA games seem very wooden by comparison.This is more than a game (and the reason for all this slightly worthy hyperbole) that demonstrates more strongly than anything that has come before it, that videogames are an\\xa0art form.\\xa0One day, we will ask our grandchildren to sit down and watch Cloverfield with us, and they will refuse, because they have no way of controlling what they are seeing.GTAIV is better than Cloverfield. With or without a controller.\\xa0\",\n",

       " {'deck': \"Despite its amazing track list, GH3 isn't as much fun as before.\",\n",
       "  'description': 'Before November of 2005, few people had any exposure to the rhythm games outside of some stumbling on a DDR dance pad after a couple of margaritas on a Saturday night at Dave and Buster\\'s.\\xa0 Then unknown companies RedOctane and Harmonix completely upended the rhythm genre by introducing a fiendishly simple, yet insanely challenging rock simulator.\\xa0 Guitar Hero quickly rose from an obscure title to premier game franchise to cultural phenomenon.\\xa0 RedOctane and Harmonix quickly became must-have properties for some of the biggest names in videogames and music.\\xa0 They shook hands and went their own ways, ready to build on and refine their rock formula.\\xa0 With their first post-split effort, Harmonix blew out their concept from just the guitar to the entire band.\\xa0 RedOctane decided to keep it simple and stuck to what they know works: Guitar Hero.Though the tiny plastic guitar was put into the hands of Neversoft, best known for the dozens of Tony Hawk games they\\'ve created, make no mistake: this is still Guitar Hero.\\xa0 At first glance, GH3 seems like a vast improvement over its predecessors, especially with the high quality of the track list, the made-over presentation, and the \"better late than never\" addition of online play.\\xa0 Unfortunately, when you focus on the more fundamental changes that Neversoft made to the game, GH3 doesn\\'t seem to rock quite so hard.Let\\'s start off with the good.\\xa0 First, the basic mechanics haven\\'t changed at all.\\xa0 You pick a song, you pick the difficulty, and simply to get to rockin\\'.\\xa0 As the song plays, different colored circles careen towards you in time with the guitar track.\\xa0 Using your Les Paul-shaped guitar controller, you hold down the correct colored button, or buttons, with one hand and click the big black strum bar with your other.\\xa0 As you keep going, the notes come faster and faster, and you\\'re required to navigate more complicated\\xa0 patterns of notes.\\xa0 Can\\'t keep up with that?\\xa0 There are star-shaped notes that will fill up your Star Power meter when hit.\\xa0 If you get that meter high enough, you can tilt the neck of your guitar to the heavens, shout \"By The Power of Grayskull!\" and activate your star power.\\xa0 Everything turns electric, your score doubles, and you\\'ll find your rock meter back in the green...provided you keep hitting the notes.Though this is still good ol\\' Guitar Hero, there are a few tweaks that will take experienced players a bit of time to get used to.\\xa0 First, GH3 is much more forgiving on the timing of your button presses.\\xa0 Anyone who had difficulty keeping up with the fast notes will find them much easier to hit this time around; the window for hitting notes has been expanded drastically.\\xa0 Also, hammer-ons - notes that don\\'t require you to strum - still work the same way as before, but their placement in the song is very, very different.\\xa0 In Guitar Hero 1 and 2, the hammer-ons were determined by the game.\\xa0 Basically, if a series of notes were close enough together, the game marked them as hammer-ons regardless of whether or not the actual guitarist strummed the notes.\\xa0 Neversoft did away with that in GH3.\\xa0 Every hammer-on is hand-placed by the developer, who worked under the guideline of \"if the guitarist strummed it, you strum it.\"\\xa0 Notice the word \"guideline.\"\\xa0 There are still some sections with a ton of hammer-ons, but for the most part you\\'ll be strumming a lot more.\\xa0 Though it\\'s a jarring change at first, eventually you\\'ll grow to appreciate how, for instance, Carlos Santana plays a bit differently than Eric Clapton.Don\\'t be fooled by the generous timing; this game is hard.\\xa0 It\\'s really, really, really hard.\\xa0 Guitar Hero 2 focused on blistering solos and crazy end wankery, where the notes seemed to just fly in all directions with little discernible pattern.\\xa0 GH3 tones that down a bit, though songs like \"Cult of Personality\" still have insane solos, to focus on chord-heavy tracks with memorable riffs.\\xa0 In order to combat the more repetitive songs, Neversoft needlessly made the riff patterns overcomplicated.\\xa0 For instance, The Who\\'s \"The Seeker\" is in the middle of the setlist, but its chord transitions are closer to the later tracks in Guitar Hero 2.\\xa0 By the time that you make it to \"3\\'s and 7\\'s\" and \"Before I Forget,\" you\\'ll be required to make extremely quick and difficult three-finger chord transitions over and over again.\\xa0 These chord patterns feel like nothing more than the developers inserting artificial difficulty into the game just to see if the players can keep up.\\xa0 While the challenge is fun at first, it quickly grows frustrating and tiring.The biggest new feature is \"battle mode.\"\\xa0 Rather than trying to outplay your opponent, you actively try to sabotoge him/her.\\xa0 When you hit a series of star-shaped notes, you gain an attack instead of Star Power.\\xa0 Now, when you flip your guitar to the heavens and yell \"By The Power of Greyskull!\", your opponent will be handicapped with one of a handful of maladies, including double-notes, increased difficulty, a broken string, or the dreaded \"lefty flip.\"\\xa0 The point is to screw your opponent so bad that they fail the song.\\xa0 This is not as much fun as it sounds.\\xa0 Most matches tend to be extremely brief, as many of the attacks are too difficult to recover from, especially on the Expert difficulty.\\xa0 Also, Guitar Hero is a game of skill, where you\\'re primarily competing against yourself rather than the opponent.\\xa0 Think about if you were playing golf, and could randomly switch out your opponent\\'s ball with one that will hook far to the left every time it\\'s hit.\\xa0 Sure, it would help you win, but it\\'s not as satisfying as simply beating him with your own superior skill.Most people think that the presentation of this game isn\\'t that important, since you\\'re just focused on the flurry of notes coming at you.\\xa0 They have a point, but the presentation makes a big difference in keeping you engaged.\\xa0 Neversoft understood this, and completely made over just about every facet of the presentation.\\xa0 The biggest improvement is in the load times.\\xa0 The load times are so tiny that you probably won\\'t be able have time to read the snarky comments on the now loading screen before you\\'re onto the rocking.\\xa0 Also, if you can tear your eyes away from the scrolling notes, you\\'ll notice that the drummer is hitting the right drums, the bassist is grooving through the bass track correctly, and the bass-mouthed singer is lip-syncing to the song.\\xa0 These little touches add that much more authenticity to the rock and roll experience that Guitar Hero is known for.\\xa0 There are a few framerate hiccups, especially when activating star power.\\xa0 It\\'s a minor gripe, because you get used to it, but it\\'s hard to imagine that this game is really pushing the Xbox 360 hardware.\\xa0 It\\'s a surprising blemish, especially since the other presentation elements are so well done. Despite all of the improvements to the presentation, the track list makes-or-breaks a music game.\\xa0 GH3 has the single most impressive track list of any Guitar Hero game to date.\\xa0 Everyone has different tastes in music, meaning that you can always argue about how the soundtrack could be better.\\xa0 That sort of nitpicking may be fun, but it has less validity this time around.\\xa0 Before you can even say, \"why isn\\'t Led Zeppelin in there,\" you\\'re countered with inclusions of top hits by The Who, The Sex Pistols, Santana, and Metallica.\\xa0 Oh, and they went ahead and threw in some original compositions from Slash and Rage Against The Machine\\'s Tom Morello for good measure.\\xa0 You can see how much more respected Guitar Hero is as a franchise now, as the developers were able to skip the semi-obscure songs like \"Last Child,\" \"Can\\'t You Hear Me Knockin\\',\" and \"Strutter.\"\\xa0 Instead, you can now play legitimate hits like \"Same Old Song And Dance,\" \"Paint It Black,\" and \"I Wanna Rock And Roll All Nite.\"\\xa0 Some of the newer tracks, like Priestess\\'s \"Lay Down,\" aren\\'t out-and-out hits, and they haven\\'t had the time to become classics, but you won\\'t really care because they\\'re a ton of fun to play.Upping the ante even further, about half of the 40-plus licensed tracks are recordings by the original artists.\\xa0 This includes just about everything from 1990 on, as well as a smattering of the older tracks.\\xa0 That may not seem like a big deal at first, after all we\\'ve been playing covers all along, but playing the original version of \"Bulls On Parade\" just rocks harder and feels much more authentic.\\xa0 However, not everything is an original recording, and you might think that the covers now stand out like a sore thumb.\\xa0 While that is true for a few of the stinkers, most of the cover versions are the best of any Guitar Hero game.\\xa0 You might be surprised when you see \"as made famous by\" pop up, because you were sure that it was the original recording.Sadly, the bonus songs could no longer include the wacky tracks by Made in Mexico, the sloppy rock of Vagiant, or all-around fun of Honest Bob and The Factory To Dealer Incentives, because most of the bonus bands from Guitar Hero 1 and 2 are made up of the Harmonix staff.\\xa0 Neversoft took a different approach and included a dozen or so bands from Europe, as well as some indie bands from the States.\\xa0 The change is a welcome one, as the bonus tracks still manage mix it up quite well.\\xa0 It\\'s nice to hear singers scream in German and French for a change.\\xa0 Neversoft also continued the tradition of adding in some ridiculously difficult tracks to the bonus setlist, including the most frightening song ever put into a Guitar Hero game.\\xa0 \"Through The Fire and Flames\" by Dragonforce is a seven-plus minute, 3722 note terror that few will ever survive for more than 2% of the song.The addition of online play is a welcome addition, and all multiplayer modes are supported.\\xa0 For anyone who worried about lag, rest your fears, because it is not an issue.\\xa0 Playing along with a friend, or foe, you\\'ll see every note that they hit and every Star Power phrase that they miss, as well as an up-to-date score, note streak, and multiplier.\\xa0 Or do you?\\xa0 If you can tear your eyes away from the flurry of notes coming at you during Slayer\\'s \"Raining Blood,\" you might catch your opponent\\'s score skipping up a few thousand points, as well as their multiplier resetting, well after they\\'ve stopped playing a section.\\xa0 This reveals that, though there is some lag, the game compensates for it and doesn\\'t screw up what you\\'re doing.\\xa0 This is a very minor problem if you\\'re neck and neck with your opponent during a pro-face off session, but it\\'s more of a problem during battle mode.\\xa0 Typically, you want to time your attacks to screw up your opponent when they\\'re hitting a section that will give them an attack.\\xa0 Because of lag, you\\'ll attack them late, causing them to retaliate by smacking your side of the screen during a blistering solo.Playing online works great, but setting up matches is painstakingly difficult.\\xa0 Halo 2 came out three years ago.\\xa0 How do companies continue to ignore its matchmaking model today?\\xa0 All you need to do is set up a lobby, get some friends together, and start matching them up randomly until they want to stop.\\xa0 Instead, you have to set up a private match, then invite an individual to game.\\xa0 That whole process can take a minute or more, depending on how many times they need to switch their guitar model and character\\'s color scheme.\\xa0 Then you get to play between 1 and 7 songs with them.\\xa0 If you want to play more than that, you have to go through the same process all over again.\\xa0 If you\\'re into playing random people, you can jump into a quick match and play whatever mode that user has set up.\\xa0 You can filter that to avoid battle or co-op, if you want.When you tally up all of its virtues, Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock is still a great game, even if it\\'s not as fun as the earlier Guitar Hero games.\\xa0 While Neversoft left the core mechanics well enough alone, the new coat of paint, superb tracklist, and online play are wonderful additions.\\xa0 However, there\\'s a subtle but significant difference between Neversoft and Harmonix.\\xa0 Harmonix are a group of musicians who make videogames.\\xa0 Neversoft are game developers who love music.\\xa0 This difference is felt in the charting of the songs, and the throwaway battle mode.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Despite an ever constant downfall from Electronic Arts that has caused many of its once glorified games to become bargain bin disasters, NHL 2008 manages to continue the tradition of success established by its predecessors. To be blunt, NHL 2008 in nearly every aspect of the game has been unaffected by the Electronic Arts curse.The level of quality in this game is clear from the onset of its introduction movie. This movie features many different clips filmed at multiple angles and speeds. Graphically, the introduction is appealing, but it also introduces the users to gameplay aspects and still extends beyond that to be an enjoyable video to watch – again and again. You are then led into a visually appealing menu where you can setup whatever you wish to do. These two things combined may seem like nothing, but they set the tone for the rest of the game as one that is at the high level that gamers in the new generation have come to expect.The gameplay itself is not far off from what you see the introduction. Through realistic sounds, mistakes by referees and three dimensional fans, the game comes alive. On the most basic level, NHL 2008 has managed to accomplish what all other hockey games have been striving for – creating an intense environment that remains throughout the entire course of a game.The dynamics work perfectly. Hits occur properly and are based on the situation at hand while the puck moves as it should and is handled by players who have realistic abilities. Nevertheless, aspects of hockey in the game, like in real life, occasionally offer weird puck bounces which lead to improbable situations. In theory this would be a horrible thing, but it actually is a blessing in disguise as it proves an old hockey adage true; “On any given night, anything can happen – anyone can win.”Implemented into NHL 2008 is a new control scheme that utilizes the right thumbstick on the Xbox 360 controller for shooting. This enhancement allows gamers to wind up for their slap shots, take a wrist shot or just snap the puck at the net. The learning curve for this control scheme is nothing beyond a game or two. Even the most hardcore NHL fans that have been playing the series for multiple gaming generations will be able to easily adapt to the new controls. However, EA thought ahead and included the classic control scheme as a controller setting that you can switch to at any time.Also introduced in NHL 2008 is the Goalie Mode which allows players to see and play the game from the viewpoint of the goalie. Saves are easily made with the bumpers and the right thumbstick. It is a very enjoyable mode that can keep players entertained for just as long, if not longer than the traditional gameplay. For those who believe that their team is so good that the puck will never get into their zone, you are able to press the ‘back’ button to change the camera between the goalie and the puck. This allows you to watch the puck and the play around it without having your controlled player on the screen.Strategy has always been important to the success of any gamer regardless of the game genre. In NHL 2008, this idea has been extended into the Create a Play mode. In this mode you can create hot routes for players when you get the puck in specific spot. These plays are difficult to call in the fast-paced and intense games, but pulling one off will leave any player with an earned sense of satisfaction. The fighting mechanics are the closest that any hockey game has ever got to being a completely realistic hockey fight. In these fights you grapple with your opponent and can choose to do one of four things; punch high, punch low, block high or block low. The important thing to note is that the blocks are not actually blocking, but instead you pull the sweater and arm of your opponent up so that he simply cannot punch. This fighting goes back forth on a scale until one combatant has the clear advantage and knocks the other down.An essential part to almost every sport is the referees, and this rings true in hockey. The referees like in life outside the game make mistakes. At times, it may be somewhat frustrating, but it doesn’t happen enough that it is going to make you lose your head. Whether it is a produced mistake or not, we will never know – but nevertheless, it is a nice addition to the game.With all that said, the gameplay is not perfect. Gamers will experience glitches every once in a while. These include skaters not being able to pick up a loose puck no matter how many times they skate over it; players not shooting until a second after being told to as well as a few others. Beyond the game, players will experience an occasional long load time when sifting between menus. These problems ruin the game experience for the moment, but are easily overlooked in the long run.The sound is simply stunning and is one of the most influential parts to making this game a success. Every sound from the scraping of your skates on the ice to the cheers and jeers of the crowd to even the yelling heard from a player who was just slashed is spot on. It is so perfect that if you played with the announcers only telling you about the goals and the penalties, you would swear that you were listening to a live hockey game.On the contrary, the soundtrack is a disappointment. The song list is not deep, and many of the songs in the game have appeared in either past NHL games and/or have been butchered to death by other Electronic Arts licenses. Regrettably, the best thing to do outside the rink is to listen to your own music instead of suffering through the game’s dull selection.Graphically, the gameplay is beautiful. Players, coaches and fans all have clear faces with realistic human traits that range from anything between scars and freckles The ice raises in a mist of frozen water when a player turns swiftly, and to extend beyond that pretty momentary image – the ice is impacted throughout the entire course of the game as it gets scratched up as players skate on it. On a larger scale, gamers are offered a chance to see hockey arenas across the nation as those in the game match their real life counterparts down to the very last details. This in itself, combined with all the other graphical achievements makes this game enjoyable on every level.In NHL 2008, there are various game modes that you can venture into to satisfy your gaming needs. These include: Play Now, Shootout, Practice Mode, EA Sports World Tournament, Dynasty Mode and Online.Play Now is a quick and easy way to play an exhibition game of hockey. Shootout is the same, except it logically is for shootouts. EA Sports World Tournament is a manually configured Olympic Style tournament that rewards the winners with either a Gold, Silver or Bronze medal.The practice mode, which plays to the ear of the experienced NHL’er is another feature that has been implemented into NHL 2008. It allows you to practice in one of four different areas; shooting, skating, goaltending and as an entire team. The shooting drill has your player stand between the red circles and shoot targets that are in the four corners of the net. This is very helpful when it comes to sharpening your accuracy, but doesn’t involve the moving and shooting ability that is essential to success. The skating drill has you carry the puck through an obstacle course around the rink. The course is good and allows you to get quite good at carrying the puck, but since there is only one course you are more likely to become an expert at the course than at carrying the puck. The goalie and team drills allow you to play as goalie and player respectively in a variety of situations. These drills are the most valuable for any player wishing to get good at the game. Despite practice mode being an extension of what has appeared in previous games, it still has a lot of room to grow into something that every serious gamer will want to take a shot at.In Dynasty Mode, players act as General Managers by taking the helm of an NHL team and its AHL affiliate. Over the course of dozens of seasons, players are expected to accomplish their yearly owners goals that can range from making x number of dollars to winning the Stanley Cup. However that is just an extension of the challenge of designing your own team as players become free agents or retire. To do this, you have to scout, sign free agents, make trades and re-sign your soon to be contract free players. The scouting system has a small learning curve, but once the information is read it becomes quite easy to understand. Essentially, you have your scouts and you send them around the world looking for prospects. They come back and depending on how good they are (you can upgrade your scouting) give you stats which may or may not be accurate. What makes this scouting system so valuable is that it compares players and ranks them in their projected draft positions.Making trades can be somewhat frustrating as new players will not be automatically sent down from the NHL. This means, that because the maximum number of players on a team cannot exceed 23 at any point in a trade, even if you plan on sending someone down, you cannot trade an AHL player for an NHL player. Instead, you have to promote that AHL player (in a different menu), go back to the trade and trade the NHL player you recently promoted for another NHL player. Other than that, the trade system is quite useful and easy to use.Free Agency allows you to pick up players from a massive list of those who are unemployed. It is fairly straight forward as you offer them a contract for x amount of dollars and x amount of years, hoping that they accept. The frustrating part about free agency is that you have to sift through the menus – if you want to get someone on your team with the last name Mitchell, then you have go down the menu through every name between A and M.The players you have on your team grow or deteriorate, depending on how well you have setup your team. All players build confidence and this affects their abilities – players with higher confidence will have higher ratings while the same is true for the opposite. This has been put in place instead of the fabulous line chemistry that has been the cornerstone of editing lines. Injuries also play an important factor as a sick or injured player will have lower rating than normal while a healthy player will have his normal ratings if not higher.As you progress through the season, you be responsible for maintaining more than just names on a roster. You will be in charge of assigning training that will affect the progression of your players’ abilities. Also, you will earn money that can be used to purchase upgrades. These upgrades can either help you on the ice by improving your trainers and/or coaches or in the front office by improving your scouts or financial assistants.Sadly, controlling how much you make is difficult and the only way to really impact it is to clear your roster of high paid players. This is because the only financials you can change is the amount of money put towards fan giveaways, the concession mark up and the average ticket price.All the while this is happening, you will be informed of what the twenty nine other teams in the league are up to. The way this is done is through your handy dandy email system. In this you will receive messages from the owner, player reports, trade offers and so much more. It is a useful and essential tool to being a successful General Manager.At the end of each season, awards are given. However, you do not even receive an email about them – in essence, they are nothing more than a side note. They mean little in the grand scheme of things, but they are nice to get and so are the achievement points you get for winning a couple of them. Hopefully, in the future EA will continue to put some value into winning these trophies. For social players, you can take your game online in multiple different modes. These modes include regular games, shootouts, team games and leagues. To find a game you can challenge a friend, look for people in the lobbies or just have NHL 2008 suit you up with a random opponent. For those with just a little time on their hands, shootout mode is the place to go. In this, you go against someone for five shots. The trick is that you have to be good at shooting and at goaltending as you must be the goaltender as in goalie mode for your opponent’s shots. This is in a stark comparison to past shootout modes where the goaltender generally was controlled by a computer. Team play allows up to eight players to go against each other in a game of hockey. Each participant is given the opportunity to lock into any position, including goalie. As entertaining as this mode sounds, a glitch occurs much too frequently to enjoy it to it’s fullest. This glitch involves puck continuously dropping at centre ice. Unfortunately, there is no fix to this and the only way to get rid of it is to leave the game.For more dedicated players, there are online leagues. These leagues allow the creator to setup everything including how many people are allowed the join, what the rules are and even the number of games each player has to play. For league maintenance, the league leader is given the ability to kick players from the league if they are inactive or cheating, and to update the message board with important news. League mode, which has appeared in past games, is still waiting for its potential to be noticed. Players must use the Xbox Live messaging system to talk with other league members and can offer no input on the league whatsoever. This causes a lot of discrepancies and ultimately leads to many people not wanting to have anything to do with them.From the NHL to Swedish Elite Leagues, to Nation teams and even the AHL, NHL 2008 gives gamers a lot of choice as to who they want to play as. Every team with the exception of a few national teams (Great Brittan, France, etc.) has one hundred percent real players that are true in ability and appearance to their hockey world counterparts. For these teams, there are multiple jerseys, including the new RBK jerseys. Of course, the jerseys are just for appearance sake, but they do their job well and add to the realism of the game.Electronic Arts, like in every sports game offers roster updates every once in a while, but it comes at a cost. Every time you login and attempt to play a game you are forced to download rosters. This can take up to a few minutes depending on what speed of internet you have. The problem is that whether there has been a downloadable roster update or not, you are still forced to download the ‘update’. It’s a small price to pay, but an annoyance none the less.Stats go hand and hand with sports, and NHL 2008 makes that more than possible. Every player has complete stats from the start of his career and these are continued when in Dynasty mode with whatever you accomplish. EA as it has always done in the past also keeps a record of all your ranked online games and provides in it in every little detail possible. Beyond that, there are online rankings that put your stats to use by ranking you against the rest of the world based on your career performance.Create-A-Modes extend beyond the previously mentioned into create a player, goalie and team. The options are plentiful for creating, but still manage to seem quite limited as many of the options that make your player or team unique are decided for you. These modes have a lot of potential, but have remained constant throughout the years of NHL games. Achievements in this game range from extremely easy to get, an example of this is the one you receive for using a created player in a game – to extremely hard, an example of this is the one you receive for beating a player online who is ranked in the Top 50. The achievements are rewarding when you get them, and are scattered throughout the various modes that you have to play the game in every aspect to get them all. Thus, the achievements in NHL 2008 have managed to get players to do what developers want – play the game entirely.This is a good game for all ages that is easy to pick up and play, but also tends to the needs of hardcore gamers. To conclude, NHL 2008 has exceeded expectations by a mile, is the best game in the series, but still has left room for potential growth.',\n",

       " {'deck': 'The best video game baseball currently in existence.',\n",
       "  'description': 'The last few years of The Show have been promising glimpses of how good a baseball game can be. Each iteration made stabs at overtaking EA\\'s MVP Baseball \\'05 as Best Baseball Game Ever. While the core gameplay in The Show has always been top-notch, each release has been plagued by varied problems -- sub-par graphics in 2007\\'s PS3 version, poor online performance, wonky bugs.But 2008 is the year where The Show has finally put it all together. This is the best baseball you\\'ll find on any console anywhere and easily lays the legendary MVP 05 to rest.The core of the game is how great the pitching/batting duel works. Pitching is even more fun this year with the addition of new pitch types (moving fastball being the most common) and statistical analysis in-game that shows your location tendencies and what pitches are/aren\\'t working. Same goes for batting. It\\'s a bit unforgiving at first as you learn how to stay patient at the plate and read incoming pitches and time your swings, but once you become acclimated, it\\'s extremely satisfying to hit. Ball physics also seem much tighter this year, with more realistic and varied line drives/bloopers/flyouts to the outfield.The most noticeable improvement is how good the game looks now. Detailed textures on grass, dirt, uniforms, helmets and stadiums all help bring the realism to near-photo quality, while improved real-time shadows and depth-of-field effects put the players in what feels like real space and a real broadcast on your TV. Character models are still a little out-of-proportion -- arms too short, shoulders too wide. And some stadiums haven\\'t been given the full next-gen treatment as gracefully as others. The game runs perfectly smooth at 720p. If you want higher resolution in the distance and infielders, you can play at 1080p, but the frame rate will dip during busy sequences and you\\'ll lose the depth-of-field effects, which really improve the look of the game dramatically. It\\'s not worth the tradeoff, in my opinion, to play at 1080p unless you just must have the sharpest picture possible.Overall atmosphere is also amazing. Stadiums have much more life. Fans leap for foul balls, infielders can dive into the stands to grab flyouts, runners heading into home plate can crash into the catcher to knock the ball out of his mitt. It\\'s also fun to see so many new animations in the field. The variety of new moves add to the realism, and responsive fielding animations seem much more context sensitive than MLB 07 (e.g. the slow lolly-gag throws to first while the runner squeeks by safely).This is also the first year where I\\'ve tried Road to the Show. I\\'ve written it off as a gimmick mode in the past, but this really is an entirely unique game unto itself. The pace is much faster than Franchise, and more instantly gratifying as you constantly get a stream of training points after you play each game and really has a stat-buliding role-playing game feel to it. It\\'s easily the most addictive, \"just one more turn\" style of gameplay you\\'ll see in a baseball game and will keep you up into the wee hours if you don\\'t keep tabs on your clock.There are a few niggling problems. (It wouldn\\'t be The Show if there weren\\'t.) But thankfully these are really minor compared to the more glaring flaws in previous versions. One of the bigger annoyances are the requirements before you can create an online league. You have to register and then wait 14 days before you can create one. You must also complete 10 online games and be rated by your peers favorably. It just seems like unnecessary barriers to something that should just work out of the box without these silly hoops. One other online league complaint -- there\\'s no fantasy draft, so you\\'ll have to use default team rosters, which obviously creates imbalance problems.There\\'s also some colliision detection problems. While it\\'s innocuous to see your outfield back into and through a stadium wall while fielding a flyout, it\\'s more problematic when the collision detection isn\\'t working when fielding grounders. You\\'ll have to square up and make clean grabs at the ball, and even then you may have an occasional ball slip through or past your legs that shouldn\\'t.Each year I can\\'t wait to see what the folks at SCEA have put together in this franchise. It\\'s clear the developers honestly love the game of baseball and take pride in their work.',\n",

       " {'deck': \"Uncharted: Drake's Fortune\",\n",
       "  'description': 'I\\'m telling you, Sully. This is it - this is finally it.\"  Years ago when Uncharted was unveiled for the first time I had very little interest in it at all. Not once did I think that this would be a very good game. But as time went by I slowly gained more and more interest in this game. Eventually Uncharted went from just another game to me and turned into one of my most anticipated games. I was simply dying to have a chance to play this game.   For those who don\\'t know you play Nathan Drake. A young explorer of sorts who believes that the great Sir Francis Drake is his ancestor. He\\'s on the trail of the treasure of El Dorado. Throughout the game the mysteries surrounding the treasure and Sir Francis Drake are slowly revealed. The story itself isn\\'t revolutionary but it is better than a good amount of other games. Then again it\\'s not the story that really pulls this game together.  One of the hardest things to do is to make controls that work well with the game. Uncharted nails this. Throughout the game you\\'ll find yourself jumping from ledge to ledge, climbing, hiding behind cover and then peaking out from behind the cover to take out the enemy. All of this sounds like it\\'s been done before and it has but what makes this gameplay different is the animations that go along with it. While playing I noticed many things that I\\'ve never seen before. With bullets flying past me as I ran I noticed Drake adjust himself and duck in order to not be hit. And as I ran up stairs I noticed a completely new animation that for the first time that I can remember in a game it actually looked like you were going up or down stairs. And the list goes on from there. The unprecedented amount of animations in this game not only look good but they add a lot to the game play. The controls aren\\'t only easy to get used to but the animations of not only Drake but all other characters make gameplay superb.   So yeah, gameplay is great but what about AI right? What can often times be a games kryptonite proved, just like everything else in this game, to make this game even better. The AI in this game is nothing short of spectacular. For instance while in the midst of a gun fight you cannot simply stay in the same place. The enemies will work together to trap you. Staying in the same place will result in you being surrounded by numerous enemies and very quickly dead. Not only that but if they can\\'t get behind you then they\\'ll simply destroy your cover and leave you open. And it\\'s not just that when it comes to AI. It really does feel like the developers put a lot of time into the enemy AI.  Now something I\\'ve yet to mention is the graphics in this game. From the lush forest and greatly detailed caves that you\\'ll explore it\\'s sometimes hard not to look around and admire the hard work. There\\'s nothing like standing high above the forest and to look out upon it all in wonder. The game is beautiful.   Now there is still one last thing that I\\'ve yet to cover. It\\'s something that makes the realism of this game all the more impressive. The way the story is told in a game can range from cutscenes to just having the characters converse in game. This game while it does follow the usual cutscene way of telling the story there is something that you\\'ll notice during each and every cutscene. They are very much presented in a movie-like fashion and the dialog helps this as well. But the one thing that really impressed me was that each character showed an amazing level of emotion. Again back to the animation, the way the characters moved and the way their faces changed during dialog allowed for a great amount of emotion to be displayed. All of this put together makes for a very cinematic feel. For the first time in a while I actually enjoyed watching the cutscenes just because of how well they were put together.  The game also offers a kind of achievement system which is a nice touch. I\\'m personally not big on achievements but as said it is a very nice added bonus.  It\\'s not all good though when it comes to this game. Going back to the story as I said before it isn\\'t the best and with the twist in the story at the end the story turns out to be a bit cliche. While it does have it\\'s elements of originality the story isn\\'t the most original, although it is hard to find a story that\\'s completely original anyways. Another downside is the game is short. On the first playthrough I took about six hours.   With a story that will keep you interested, great gameplay, amazing graphics, superb animation and heck something I didn\\'t even cover great sound (background music, sound effects, etc.) this game is a must have. With four difficulty levels and a large amount of achievements this game is sure to last you. ',\n",

       "  'description': 'The demo was really what worked me up about this game. In the demo it did not show any flaws but a demonstration of how annoying the time limit can be. So just because I thought it was a minor thing I went out and bought it.  The Good: Graphics are great, blood and gore feels right, crazy storyline, sound effects match exactly what you are doing, cars that can run over lots of zombies, bizarre cutscenes, bosses are scary and the zombies act like they are zombies.  The Bad: Save system is very annoying - While this does make the game more challenging, how could it be said that it will be fun needing to finish a boss all over again because you died while finding a savepoint? Survivor AI - The survivors will not exactly make anything realistically easy for you. Instead they will absolutely love to kill everything in their path regardless of if there in the way or not. Double Standard Boss AI - Every boss will feel like they are handicapped to the extreme, the first boss taking at least 15 bullets to the head until \"just injured\". Time Limit - You cannot just play around in the game. You have to complete or arrive on each main mission which can be absolutely annoying when you are not in the mood. Unlimited Lives Boss Encounters - I will not specify this exactly because of spoilers however for about 5/6 of the game a set of bosses will respawn regardless if you dealt with them before. From what I was talking about earlier the wasted potential is practically everything, the bosses are no fun to kill most of the time, there are no teammates to help you besides the survivors which are not very smart and most of all there is a big stress about getting from point A to point B in a time limit without dying. It’s not a fun concept.The best parts of the game are hidden because of a these flaws. I just wished they changed a lot of the storyline and concept to make the game more fun than it is an errand/chore to suffer through. ',\n",

       "  'description': \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms is undoubtedly one of the only games that allows you to step into the life of an individual from times past with so much depth. As mentioned previously, in this game you assume the role of an officer in ancient China during the Three Kingdoms era. There is a huge cast of 500+ to choose from as well as an addition create-an-officer mode where you can edit their statistics, blood relatives, and a host of other interesting options. Once you've chosen an officer there are endless options of actions to do. There is also the factor of your officers standing. He or she may be appointed to ranks such as Liege, Warlord, Prefect, Officer, or even a Ronin. Each of the positions offers different options and abilities.Now for what you can actually do in the game. From the main screen, or initial city view, you are presented with a row of shields all essentially functioning like trees. The shield lists the subject on it and all actions of that category are listed in them. A host of things are offered including diplomacy, military, ploys, buying/selling items, socializing, infrastructural duties, and even faction management if you're a Liege. You can't quite tell the depth that it offers just from what I've stated above and you really can't tell from anything I could say, but each of them has a great amount of sub actions, each bearing their own repercussions and rewards.If you find yourself in a battle, you're in for a decent amount of fun. Battles are handled on a grid-based map using armies created and maintained from your initial city view. Each army is offered a choice of different ploys to make use of and offered a few options for strategy, such as surround or ambush. It's also probably worth noting that combat is handled in a turn based manner as is moving of armies. Overall, it's enjoyable if you don't mind combat that puts emphasis on tactics over heavy cinematic action.The graphics are relatively dated, yet due to the style of game, are sufficient. Battle is handled via small sprites on a fairly simple map and characters are portrayed via portraits. It could be more graphically pleasing than it is. The soundtrack is a nice collection of music suiting to the era and is actually interesting to listen to, though repetitive after a while.So in conclusion, if you're a fan of historical simulation/strategy games or liked the previous installments of RotTK, you'll most likely enjoy your time spent on this one.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'SUMMARY: Though extremely challenging to casual players, GRID is rewarding and brings the fun back to sim racers.Highlights: Fun, competitive racing; Wide variety of race types; Excellent damage modeling; Team racing; Sponsor goals; Customizable voice overLowpoints: Hard; Driving model is a little too responsive for a sim; Very high learning curve; Repetitive voice over at times; Limited painting options<img src=\"http://image.com.com/gamespot/images/2008/079/939160_20080320_screen003.jpg\" width=\"420\" /><i>Did I mention that this game is competitive?</i>To start things off, let\\'s get one thing straight: GRID is hard. If you don\\'t think it\\'s hard then you\\'re either great at racing games or you don\\'t have the difficulty set high enough. GRID\\'s driving model straddles a no man\\'s land between simulation and arcade. While it certainly leans to the simulation side, the handling is just a touch too responsive making it feel a bit like an arcade racer. Just getting accustomed to GRID\\'s nuances is part of its difficulty; knowing that you can drive a little more recklessly than you could in say Gran Turismo or Forza but then suddenly the realism switch will turn on and you\\'ll go sliding out of control - only to have it switch completely off and go into the realm of fantasy as your car hits a curb or barricade and goes spinning off into the stratosphere.OK, so I\\'m exaggerating just a little here - but not much.But because this is a driving game, mastering those nuances is going to greatly affect your opinion of the game.Actually, let\\'s back up a bit: GRID is a simulation racing game developed by Codemasters. The same people that brought us the rally racing game, DiRT. Using the same driving engine, GRID handles much the same way although I think the responsive engine is much more suited for the asphalt than it was for the earth. Like DiRT, GRID also features a gorgeous interface that\\'s easy to navigate, a pleasure to interact with, and loading screens that are informative and just as attractive. This might sound like a minor thing but the interaction design here is really one of my favorite aspects of the game.<img src=\"http://image.com.com/gamespot/images/2008/155/reviews/939160_20080604_screen009.jpg\" width=\"420\" /><i>Just one example of the attractive interface style.</i>But why am I talking about menus when I should be talking about racing? When the game starts, you\\'ll be placed in the position of a driver for hire working to make money for other racing teams until you have enough money to start your own team - which is a bit weird because when you do start driving for yourself, your \"team\" will consist of only you. The game progresses simply by winning races and taking home event trophies as you make your way to the top of the leaderboard. Single races can be played for fun but you\\'ll only make progress in the game by playing in the career mode known as, GRID World. Here too you can race in single races for other teams where your reward is big cash prizes. GRID also has a reputation system that tells how you rank against other drivers in the world. Racing for other teams in single races will win you big money, especially if you complete the bonus objective (things like getting a podium finish or simply beating another team) but it won\\'t impact your reputation points as much.GRID World Events are the bulk of the racing where each race is restricted to a single car class and consists of 2 or more races where you\\'re competing for points. The driver with the most points at the end wins the event. Teams also factor in here as you\\'ll get additional cash for getting overall team wins. Events are broken down into three regions, each with 6 event races for that license class. Oh, yes by the way, there are licenses. However, they\\'re based not on passing any tests but rather reaching certain reputation levels. Earn enough reputation points in a region and you unlock the next license for that region. Eventually, you can gain enough reputation to unlock the global license, unlocking more races and allowing you to race in any region.<img src=\"http://image.com.com/gamespot/images/2008/062/reviews/939160_20080303_screen007.jpg\" width=\"420\" />What really separates GRID from games like Gran Turismo or Forza is the variety of races. Touring, open wheel, endurance, drifting, drift battles, downhill drifts, touge (which I hate), city races, tracks, daytime, nighttime, and even the infamous 24 hour Le Mans which lasts for 24 minutes - taking you throughout an entire day and night, on poorly lit roads - which somehow, the AI cars seem unaffected by lack of light on both Le Mans and Touge races. Heck, there\\'s even demolition derby races. Sure, GT and Forza feature hundreds of cars that will determine the race style, but something about them gets bland and repetitive. Maybe it\\'s only because it\\'s still fresh but GRID feels like you\\'re never racing the same race twice. Each event is also limited to the class of car that can be entered and this is what I feel is the hallmark of GRID. With the exception of the Le Mans, in each race you\\'ll only ever have 2 or 3 different car makes on the track at once - despite there being up to 20 cars on the track in some races. And because GRID doesn\\'t offer any way to add performance upgrades to cars, each driver is on a level playing field. The result: close competitive races where one mistake can cost you everything. What\\'s more, the computer AI is racing for the same stakes. You\\'ll never find one or two cars that blow the rest of the field away because they simply have the best car. If someone\\'s winning, it\\'s because they\\'re racing well and if someone\\'s lagging behind well... either they suck, but more commonly it\\'s because a car spun out in a turn, blew a tire, or even blew an engine. Regardless of what car someone is driving or even who is driving, who will win is never certain and no one is immune to happenstance accidents. It\\'s an incredible feature that makes your opponents feel more alive and because each race is competitive with no certain outcome, the fun factor skyrockets. Winning races is no longer a matter of who has the fastest car, but rather who\\'s the best driver. Having to avoid car pileups because someone crashed while your screen is filled with white smoke only adds to the excitement and unpredictability of races.The great challenge of GRID is it\\'s steep learning curve. Typically, racing games start you out in everyday $20K drivers. The result is that you\\'re able to get a feel for the driving engine as well as learn the tracks at low speeds. Then as you get better cars you\\'re able to drive the courses faster as you\\'re already accustomed to them. While GRID doesn\\'t put you in a Nissan NSX from the very beginning, you do start out driving Mustangs (old and new), Vipers, and even Skyline GT-Rs. Your typical Civics, GTIs, and Celica\\'s are nowhere to be found. What this means is that you have to learn tracks at high speeds; nor is it always clear which track you\\'ll be racing since tracks are listed by location and route only - no helpful pictures. During an event, you\\'ll also race tracks both directions and even change locations after each race. Mix that up further by different races racing only on certain courses and each location having at least two tracks (normal and reverse) and some as many as 6, it can take awhile to get accustomed to each race.GRID does offer a few driving aids to make things easier, and like Forza, turning these aids off and making the game more difficult will increase your reward for each race. These options are limited though: overall difficulty (basic, normal, serious, savage, extreme), traction control, manual or auto, anti-lock brakes, and stability control. I personally found turning off stability control made the game a bit easier to drive as it reduced the super sensitive responsiveness of the cars. What the game is lacking is a driving assist line to show you the best path and when to brake. Honestly, the only other game I\\'ve played that used such a feature was Forza - and that became a crutch for me. What it does have is a little light in the bottom left corner that blinks when you\\'re approaching turns too fast. It\\'s a little too inconspicuous when you need it and at times, unreliable, but it\\'s certainly helpful and unobtrusive to more experienced drivers. In GRID World races, there\\'s also an option to turn on Pro Mode which will make you unable to restart races onces begun. This game would kill me [on Normal] if it weren\\'t for restart so I don\\'t play on Pro Mode.<img src=\"http://image.com.com/gamespot/images/2008/134/939160_20080514_screen004.jpg\" width=\"420\" /><i>There\\'s an achievement for winning while locked to this view. I won\\'t get that achievement.</i>There is another option to make races a little more forgiving. A feature called \"Flashback.\" Although it\\'ll be available automatically when you crash your car to the point where it\\'s un-drivable, it can also be activated at any time in the pause menu. What it will do is let you rewind the race a few seconds so that you can retry that turn you took too fast the first time and sent you careening into the jersey barriers. Your difficulty setting determines how many Flashbacks you\\'re allowed and you\\'re never required to use them. However, doing so will lower your both your rewards for reputation as well as prize money so it\\'s at your advantage to do without.<img src=\"http://image.com.com/gamespot/images/2008/155/reviews/939160_20080604_screen020.jpg\" width=\"420\" /><i>Your home away from home.</i>Keep the patience dial turned to 11 and you\\'ll eventually learn the tracks and how each car handles differently. Once you cross that line, racing becomes considerably easier but still, ever challenging. No two races ever play out the same and, depending on your difficulty level, even the best drivers will have those occasional mishaps. Even when you\\'re comfortable racing, it\\'s the unpredictability and challenging AI that keep winning races a satifying and rewarding experience - especially when each one of your sponsors has to pay you big bucks.While the driving engine can be a little unpredictable at times, it is executed exceptionally well and Codemasters\\' attention to detail in every other regard makes up for any minor deficiencies. The damage modeling is fantastic and, in most cases, how your car is damaged will effect how your car performs - though I\\'ve found that your car can take remarkable amounts of abuse and have no ill effect whatsoever. Sometimes. This is one of those cases where GRID is remarkably inconsistent. In addition to your car handling differently, pieces of your\\'s and others\\' cars will fall off as they take damage. These pieces don\\'t just disappear either. Rather they stay on the course where they landed, becoming themselves, obstacles that will impact your can when run over. Perhaps one of the most overlooked details of other racing games, Codemasters decided to make GRID\\'s tracks themselves interactive by allowing you to crash directly through walls or having tire barricades explode, with tires sailing through the air and rolling across the ground when struck. Glass will shatter and eventually break out. Bumpers will hang down on one side, rubbing along the ground with sparks flying off until the entire thing eventually falls off.And to top it off, your team manager and pit boss, as well as your racing teammate, will be talking to you, updating you on race status the entire time... addressing you by name. It\\'s a small thing but it\\'s just another one of those details that Codemasters seems to be so attune to. For the most part it never gets repetitive or annoying, although depending on your teammate, they might be a complete moron, a pretty decent guy, or hardly say a word. The only time I\\'ve really found the voice over to get tiresome is during drift races. For some reason, the pit boss feels the need to remind me at the beginning of every race that I need to get close to the flag to score points. Or repeatedly tell me that I need to be physically leading the other drift battle cars, despite leading in point score. Where this really gets irritating is if you have tendency to restart these races often [as, umm, someone I know does...], then you\\'ll hear the same words each and every time. Thankfully, a quick trip to the options menu will quiet him down.GRID isn\\'t a long game and it doesn\\'t have the extensive car collections that Forza has, never mind anything close to Gran Turismo. I think the car count is somewhere close to 45. Which honestly, that\\'s really all you need. When a race only allows two or three car models, your not likely going to be needing 20 cars of the same class. As I already mentioned, it also doesn\\'t have any car customization options like Forza or other arcade racers like Need for Speed or Project Gotham Racing. It will let you do a few limited team related things; such as choose 3 paint colors and pick a design from several (around 20 or 30) patterns. (If you want to paint cars, stick to Forza. If you want to race, well...) You can also pick a team name, choose between sponsors as they become available, (with some limited control over where sponsor names appear) as well as hire and fire teammates as you see fit. Teammates, usually have a signing fee and will take a percentage of each win. The better the driver, the more they\\'re going to cost.Multiplayer is the standard fare. The online is a bit of a drag since when looking for a match it\\'ll simply plop you in any ol\\' race, regardless of your skill rank or where the current race is at in terms of progress. This means it may take you a few tries to find a game that\\'s close enough to over that it\\'s worth waiting for it to end or find one that hasn\\'t begun yet. Somewhat unique to GRID is that races are selected democratically. Rather than the host getting to select whatever they please, each player has a small window of time to vote for their race preference. The race with the highest votes is the one that\\'s played. With the exception of getting matched up with some people that had obviously been playing for a while - and were insanely better than me - I didn\\'t run into any problems while online. Framerates stayed smooth and lag was occasional but minimal.<img src=\"http://image.com.com/gamespot/images/2008/155/reviews/939160_20080604_screen012.jpg\" width=\"420\" /><i>Talk about responsive. Try driving one of these.</i>When all is said and done, I\\'m feeling generous with this one. Once you\\'re able to overcome the steep learning curve [for casual gamers], GRID is a tremendously rewarding and satisfying race game that stays competitive and unpredictable. It puts the focus on the driver rather than what car you drive. Like any race game, it\\'ll benefit those that learn to drive well consistently and take advantage of the opportunities that arise - not to mention have the wherewithal to react to ever changing track conditions. But it\\'s always challenging and despite its short career mode, upping the difficulty level and the game\\'s competitive online multiplayer, should keep you coming back for more. Most importantly, it makes simulation racing fun again. Heck, even the replays are exciting to watch. If only there were a way to record and share them online...',\n",

Day/night cycles, NPC schedules, variable in-game economy, customization through haircuts and tattoos, stylish armor and weapon design ... they\\'ve got all the bullet points you\\'d expect from a modern RPG. The game actually shares a lot in common with World of Warcraft -- playful character design, lots of silly dances and expressions and humor, colorful environments, a streamlined user interface, and mostly straight-forward questing.Like WoW, Fable is also easy to learn and get into. Quest objectives are clearly shown on your mini-map, solutions are never too tough to figure out, and the game is generally easy to complete from start to finish.On the downside, however, it means the game never really gets its hooks into you. The combat is simple fun but repetitive -- even moreso when you consider you\\'ll be facing the same half-dozen variety of enemies throughout the entire game. There are a few boss battles that throw minor wrinkles into the formula, but for the most part, the fights you see at the beginning of the game are basically the fights you\\'ll be dealing with for the next 10 to 15 hours.The story is also standard fantasy fare. While the voice-acting is quite good, the actual plot doesn\\'t stand out from anything you\\'ve played countless times before. The game world is also fairly shallow. There\\'s no real overarching mysteries or lore than will command your attention. There\\'s plenty of slightly clever quests and choices. Do you choose to run a bordello or turn it into a women\\'s shelter? Do you choose to save a kid being picked on, or pick on him yourself? Overall, it\\'s always a binary, saint-or-sinner, black-or-white morality system which gives the illusion of \"choice\" but, like so many other developers that do this (cough Bioware cough), your only choice is to be total nice guy or a total jerk.At the end of Fable, you can look back on 15-some hours of generally pleasant RPG adventuring.

       "  'description': \"This game is definitely a fun game for Dragon Ball Z fans. It goes back to the Budokai style of fighting on a 2D plane and is simple for a lot of people to pick up and play. I had some friends over who don't particularly care for or know anything about Dragon Ball Z, but they picked up the controller and were doing some spectacular moves in minutes. Speaking of spectacular moves, the game looks incredible. The movement is fast paced and very fluid. You can pick up the controller and button mash, which most of my friends are doing, but there are also a wide variety of moves for fighting strategically as well.  The story mode starts at the beginning of the Z series and goes up until the end of the Cell Saga. Though there were some characters that were I wish I could've played as who are in the Buu Saga, the game offers some great side quests including Bardok and Broly. There are not many level designs to be chosen from in the game, but what is there is beautifully done. For those of you who are not familiar with the story of Dragon Ball Z, this game will be incredibly difficult to follow. There are cut scenes before and after many of the fights, but it will be very hard to understand what is going on if you are not already familiar with the story already. That said, if you are familiar with the story, you will be able to play through and re-experience some of the greatest moments in Dragon Ball Z, including: The fight between Goku and Frieza and the fight between Gohan and Cell. As far as I could tell, most of the voice actors have returned to voice their characters. This, however, doesn't mean that the script is all that wonderful. Some of the most memorable lines from the show have been re-written for the game and don't have the same pull they once did. I haven't been able to spend much time with the online play, but from what I have done, it has been lag free. That being said, all of the fights that I have done were with people inside of the United States.  Thus, Dragon Ball Z: Burst Limit is a fun game for all, but it will especially appeal to those who are familiar with the series already. If you pick up this game expecting to learn the story as you play through it, you will have a very difficult time picking up what is going on. If you are looking for a game that is fun for button mashers, strategic players, and Dragon Ball Z fans, Burst Limit is definitely something you should try.\",\n",

This storied franchise has been through a lot. From its begginning in the nes era. Till now in the seventh generation console era. You knew this was going to be a great game from past experiences with other Metal Gear Solid games. Personally I did not play any Metal Gear Solid Metal Gear games, until the 4th installment in the Metal Gear Solid franchise. The hype surrounding this game had caused me to want a Playstation 3. I had high hopes for this game, seeing as I spent 600$ on it (bought the ps3). However my aspirations had been shattered by this game and were surpassed by untold amounts of enjoyment and fun.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The story in this game is nothing short of a masterpiece. It is so jam packed with content you never get bored throughout the game. And I have heard people complain about the long cinematics. I find them to be a pleasant addition. It gives more clarity and depth. Snake is now an old man trying to fullfill one last mission. And it isn't an easy one. This game makes me wonder as to why all games can't have a great plot mixed in with an unbelievable gameplay system.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Hideo Kojima not only makes a creative,awe-inspiring univers but he also manages to create a game with great gameplay mechanics. This game has a little something for everyone. It has action for all the people that are used to run and gun games. They can take out enemies bu using cqc, and even have some amazing fire fights. A good fire fight sequence is when you meet up with Meryl and have to escape from a hotel. That is all out shooting there. But there is also my personal favorite, stealth. This has been around from day one in Kojima's games. This is one of the few games that truly get this feature right.\\xa0Snake has a new octo camo suit. This works by staying stationary on a flat surface, whether it be the wall or ground, and the suit will automatically take the texture and color of that object. This allows for many possibilities. Also there is a plethora of guns in this game. They all really handle well. My favorite is the P90.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 This game is a breakthrough in gaming. This a game that many companies should take example from and try to follow that formula. It has a great story blended with a beautiful world. The gameplay mechanics are unparalleled. I am definitly lookin forward to playing the first three in the series.\",\n",

       "  'description': \" If one recalls my Assassin's Creed review, I spoke about a game not delivering on the promises it makes during development. In a way, this point relates to Mass Effect, a game that, despite the LOFTIEST of promises made during the games lengthy production, seems to have followed through with each and every one. However... this leaves the game feeling more than a bit... scatter shot in some key areas.The story is, for all intents and purposes, the highest point of the game here. In fact, this might be one of the best told and fleshed out stories in any game, RPG or otherwise. The tale goes that in the not so distant future, humanity uncovers artifacts from an ancient alien race known as the Protheans that slingshots their technology, especially in the areas of military and space travel, centuries into the future. Now successfully part of a galactic alliance with several other alien races, humanity has once again unearthed a Prothean artifact, a beacon, that you, as your very own created Commander Shephard, are sent to retrieve and bring before the galactic council. Things immediately goes south, as a rogue SPECTRE (essentially super privilaged secret agents) named Saren seeks to use the beacon for his own devices. The whole thing becomes infinitely more complicated until soon, the fate of the entire universe rests on Shephard and his team.The way the story is presented, through several well produced cutscenes, and countless engrossing conversations of which the player is free to progress through as they see fit. It's all very deep stuff, and it is voiced to perfection by each and every actor in the bunch. Indeed, sound is another excellent aspect of the Mass Effect package, as guns sound impactful, creatures sound appropriately alien and ferocious, and music switches between epic space opera to beeping and booping techno beats during specific sequences. The visuals keep up for the most part as well, as characters are detailed and expressive. This is a good looking game overall, but many graphical glitches occur when textures forget to load or environments pop up out of nowhere. It's nothing too major, but it takes away from the otherwise spectacular presentation and sound package (not to mention the story) when a scene switches only to see textures finishing loading while the action is already well under way.This sets up Mass Effect to be quite the high end adventure, and as far as ground covered, Mass Effect offers a LOT to explore. An entire universe, practically, is set up for you to explore relatively early. Although the actual story missions only take you to a handful of these, there will eventually be one of the game's well written side quests that leads you to the other ones. The games sense of scale is amazing, and it truly is a treat to see how large this universe that Bioware actually is.Now this may seem like the pros FAR outweigh the cons, and... lets be honest, this game really had no chance of being BAD.However...We haven't reached gameplay. And gameplay is where things all start to go wrong for Mass Effect. For one thing, the interface here seems to be... broken. Navigation and inventory, two things that should be on lockdown in any RPG, are somehow unforgiveably screwed up in this game. Managing items is very frustrating, and on planet surfaces, where navigation is hardest to get a handle on, the mini map provided is completely useless.Secondly, the combat employed here is nothing special. It's just the experience here is too lopside-ed. If you play as a soldier, you'll only get the games somewhat boring shooting mechanics, and miss out on the games funner aspects, like using tech and biotic powers. It just seems that the combat tries to be a shooter, but can't hold up it's end, while still maintaining a magic system that seems stunted to make way for the shooting aspects. It works in some instances, but in others, completely fail.Mass Effect is an ambitious game, but in it's ambition, almost misses basic game mechanics that NEED to be there. It's redeeming qualities make up for the flaws it entails, but one can't help thinking that things should be more solid than they are. Mass Effect still gets an 8.0 for being a well crafted game with a fantastic story, but with a pile of minor annoyances that just should not be there in such a title.PS: Auto save MY ASS! \",\n",

The game plays out in a sort of open ended city, where you\\'ll be skating around completing objectives like collecting skate footage and still pictures along with \"Owning\" special areas around the city and facing other skaters in various skating challenges. Yes... the only focus of the game is skating, and although I am often skeptical of games set in a single setting, for the type of objectives and gameplay you\\'re expected to execute in this game, it works wonderfully. However, the \"story\" linking these activities together is pretty much non-existent, which is fine for a skating game except that it TRIES to exist, and just fails with hokey dialogue and pseudo-slang coupled with annoying characters and drab cutscenes that drag the overall presentation of what is a really decent looking next gen title down. Still, with good character models and unique lighting effects including use of several filters gives the game an overall visual design that is unique, yet familiar at the same time.And the visual design is the only thing familiar about the skating in this game, because unlike the Tony Hawk franchise, EA has opted for an entirely different, analog stick centric control scheme. You\\'ll be flicking the right stick to ollie and perform flip tricks, and using the triggers to perform grabs. The game\\'s controls are intuitive, but the learning curve behind the stick controls are STEEP, and after hours of playing, don\\'t expect to have learned to execute anything more than a kickflip, shuvit, and other variations with any sort of regularity. The flips are all unlocked at the very beginning of the game, it\\'s just up to YOU to learn how to execute them, making a level of challenge that\\'s both a boon, and a hindrance. On one hand, it\\'s all on you, not your character or equiptment, to actually learn this games brand of skating, but on the other, if you\\'re not nailing those tricks with any sort of regularity, you\\'re going to get very very frustrated, and that\\'s not any fun..skate is a good first offering for this young franchise. Though it has it\\'s flaws, it\\'s definitely got potential to be a rival to the crumbling Tony Hawk juggernaut.',\n",

       "  'description': 'What\\'s that you say? Another \"dogsounds reviews:\"? About time? Well, yes. But this one is...well...just a little late to the party. I haven\\'t had chance to get my hands on any new games lately, so I\\'m afraid this one is an oldie. A title from the original Xbox catalog: Doom 3, to be precise. It\\'s not that I am way behind in my games tally! I just realised that I had never really played through Doom 3 when I originally got it on release, and as it is on the 360 Backwards Compatibility List and I was stuck for something to play, I popped it in. Doom 3 is id Software\\'s remake (or rather, re-imagining) of their 1993 first-person shooter, Doom. The original was somewhat of a milestone in gaming history, being the first FPS to offer an immersive, engaging gameplay experience, networked multiplayer, and the possibility of user-generated content and expansions (interestingly, it is still common for people to create and upload new game files to the id servers even today). In fact, such a ground-breaking game was it that for many years, first-person shooters that followed in its footsteps were often referred to as \"Doom Clones\". Such a cultural meme wasn\\'t seen again until after the launch of Halo: Combat Evolved in 2001, when the phrase \"Halo Killer\" was often used for games of the genre. In 2000, id was ruminating on whether to resurrect the Doom franchise for, what was at the time, the next generation of video game consoles and much more advanced computer hardware. There was some resistance in-house, with some sides wanting to avoid rehashing old franchises and start on something new. But persistence paid off, and after the success of Return To Castle Wolfenstein work eventually started on Doom 3 - not a new instalment, but rather a re-creation of the game that started it all using all the latest technology available. Over the next few years, tiny glimpses of the work-in-progress were revealed to the world, and gamers were amazed by what they saw. What stunned people so much were the visuals. And because, for the most part, the visuals are the most prominent feature of the game, we\\'ll start there. I\\'m going to be reviewing the Xbox version of the game, because that\\'s what I have, and I think the console version of the game represents the most outstanding use of the hardware available. PC users were used to jaw-dropping visuals, as they were able to spend a small fortune pimping their gaming rigs to the max (although it has to be said, Doom 3 did break new ground for PC users too, and pushed most setups to the limits). Doom 3 is, without a doubt, one of the most amazing looking games ever seen on the Big Black Behemoth that was the original Xbox. Like a small number of others such as Chronicles Of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay and Black, it\\'s release late in the lifecycle of the console meant that the developers had more than enough time to figure out how to get as much as possible from the hardware and software available to them, and boy, did they ever. These were games that made you wonder what the other developers had been doing all this time, as most other games looked simple and plain by comparison. The console version of Doom 3 was released seven months after its PC counterpart, and for the most part, the graphical difference between the two is not that significant. Sure, the PC version had higher resolution textures, but that is no surprise. Somehow, the developers managed to create a game that ran on the Xbox without skimping on any of the lighting or atmospherics to any great degree. What resulted is a game that stands up remarkably well, even compared to today\\'s generation of games. For the most part, you find yourself trawling through dark corridors, dimly-lit hallways and rooms filled with gas and steam. Lights flicker, fail, and often move. And the shadows move with them, thanks to very well implemented dynamic lighting. Often the action takes place in almost total darkness, and the only sight of your enemy through the gloom is glowing red eyes. Combined with the grimy, decrepit and grubby industrial feel of the location, the graphics and lighting work together to create a gloomy, foreboding and oppressive atmosphere that is exactly what a survival horror game needs - which is what this is. Level design is excellent - the amount of detail in the objects is astounding - and by that I mean not the number of rivets on a wall, but the sheer number of tubes, pipes, gadgets, machines and general industrial stuff you see in each room. You really feel like the designers have created a virtual version of a real industrial complex. And the lighting is so good at adding to the general spookiness that many times I found myself throwing grenades into a room to take out a bad guy, guided only by the presence of his shadow moving about around a corner, only to find I had wasted my supplies on a moving light behind a fan or pipe or something. Playing through it today I am amazed at exactly what the developers were able to get out of the console - it is that good looking. As a contrast, the visuals in Chronicles Of Riddick were equally impressive, but just made you think how awesome everything looked. In Doom 3, you had that and the feeling of \"Oh crap oh crap oh crap!\" as well. One other interesting and well-implemented aspect of the visuals is the use of computer screens and monitors in-game - quite radical at the time. Many times you will have to access a computer screen or panel to activate a switch, open a door or some such. This is achieved by forcing the player\\'s weapon to drop and giving him a cursor to move around the screen, and means that the player can be given a number of different options on any one terminal screen. You still see the rest of the room around you - so there is no jarring change of viewpoint. The screens are presented as high-resolution, smooth and clear images, and animate with your actions. Some even include adverts within the GUI. The graphics are so impressive that this game could be released as an Xbox 360 title right now with only an increase in resolution of the texture images, and it would compare to or even better it\\'s contemporaries in most respects. So, what I am saying is Best Game Evar!!eleven!!, right? Well, actually, no, not really. See, it looks pretty and all, but gameplay-wise, we are on shakier ground. The games sees you take the role of an un-named Space Marine who has been transferred to the Union Aerospace Research Facility on Mars in 2145. Seems that strange days are afoot at UAC, who are military and technology contractors developing tools \"for the good of mankind\". Far from the auspices of Earth it seems that the head of Delta Labs, Dr. Malcolm Betruger, has been getting involved with experiments into teleportation and has discovered that there is a startling side-effect to the process - that transportation from A to B involves passing through Hell itself. He has done a deal with the denizens of the underworld after unwittingly unleashing demons upon the base, and with personnel disappearing and strange accidents all over the place the UAC is getting edgy and shipping in more security. It\\'s up to you to find out exactly what is afoot and try to stop Betruger before he is able to lead the minions of hell away from Mars and on to Earth. It sounds a bit cheesy, but throughout the game the story is actually pretty well fleshed out, and is given more depth though the player accessing audio, video and text logs of scientists stationed in the base. Intrinsically these logs are designed to give the player codes that he needs to access systems and open weapons lockers, but the majority of the messages and logs the player experiences are \"slice of life\" commentaries - staff complaining about their colleagues, organising socials, bemoaning red tape, or commenting on their nervousness about the mysterious things happening in the base. But, whilst the plot and back-story are certainly interesting, sadly the gameplay itself is not. When id remade Doom, they made a conscious decision to stay true to the gameplay of the original - otherwise it would not truly be Doom. Unfortunately, what they forgot is that standard gameplay mechanics for first-person shooters had evolved past the old-skool basic run and gun, circle-strafe mentality. Without any real application of tactical thinking or complex enemy behaviour, Doom3\\'s play seems stale, stifled and, quite often, boring. The first few times you meet a new combatant, you learn their stiff and predictable behaviours, and how to avoid their fire. Unless you are being shot at by a zombiefied Space Marine, you are usually having something thrown or fired at you slowly. Simply step out of the path of the incoming rocket/plasma ball, step back, fire, rinse and repeat. Fighting bosses is simply a case of run around the outside of a room, and stay in cover until he is between shots and you can fire back. Also not helping the gameplay are the weapons - for the most part, they sound weak and feeble - whoever chose the lame Buck Rogers pew! pew! pew! firing sound for the plasma rifle should be taken out and shot. With a much louder weapon. Gunplay is drab and lifeless. Without auto-aim the controls are not responsive enough to allow you to accurately aim for the head without lots of wasted ammo, and with auto-aim you usually end up hitting the torso - which requires more hits to score a kill. Weapon effectiveness does not scale well either - traditionally the later you get the weapon, the more powerful it should be, but some of the later weapons in this game feel far too weak. And, finally, the damn flashlight. You have a flashlight as a separate item, and cannot hold a weapon at the same time. And as the game is 95% shin-banging-on-the-table dark, this is a real pain in the ass, especially when most enemies appear without warning. I can understand the mechanic - to intensify the creepiness of the game - but in reality, and over the course of the whole game, it is a pain. And, simply put, the idea that this far in the future there are no weapons with flashlights is simply absurd and exposes the mechanic to accusations of silly contrivance. You would think that the dark, tight corridor nature of the game would smooth this rough edge a little, and at first it does. The first time you walk down a dark corridor and a panel flies off the wall, you jump. The first time this happens and a dude leaps out of the hole, you jump some more. But after a while, the way enemies appear becomes formulaic. If there is an Imp spawning in front, you know there\\'ll be one behind. Once you see the developers\\' patterns (\"oh look, a big fat healthpack right in the middle of a room. What could possibly go wrong here?\") it becomes old. And sadly, even though the oppressive gloom and bleak corridors combined with the excellent ambient and environmental audio, work perfectly to put you on edge and spook the living **** out of you, even this backfires, for it does not take long before it becomes tiring, and straining to see through the dark becomes hard work. And when I say tiring, I mean literally. The atmosphere is so immersive that you really to feel in the game, and eventually you really will start to feel anxiety and fear and stress. In a single level in a game, this is great. But when it is hour after hour, for the whole damn game, you physically feel like crap and depressed, and have to bail out and take a break. It\\'s just too much. I started to look upon playing as a chore. So, so far we have great to look at, but dull to play (knew a girl like that once...). What about multiplayer? Sadly, I have no idea as I went online and there was ONE guy sat in a game. Some poor bastard who probably sits there like a spider waiting for some other poor soul to stop by. There is one awesome feature that I have to point out though - online co-op. Co-op is not supported on a single console, but IS supported over Xbox Live. The fact that this was included when other big-league titles of the time said it couldn\\'t be done - especially considering the amount of work the console is doing to render the mind-blowing graphics - is astounding. The campaign is pretty much the same, although you are presented with the levels to play as you wish. Interestingly, cutscenes and dialog reflect the change in player numbers and no longer reference a single marine, which is a nice touch. So, to wrap up. In so many ways Doom 3, like Riddick is an astounding graphical tour-de-force that shows exactly what the original Xbox was capable of, and exposes just how few developers ever fully tapped into that. Like Riddick it has an incredible depth of thought behind its visual design and creation, and has an engaging story. Sadly, unlike Riddick, it also staggers around fettered by old-school gameplay, poor AI, feeble and uninteresting weaponry and the unusual game design mechanic of making the player feel like the game wants to take their gaming soul and rip it out of their ass, chew it up, spit it out and grind it into the dust with a well-worn cloven foot. Which kinda sucks. Dogsounds\\' score: 2½ out of 5 stars - because no matter how pretty the game, if I don\\'t want to play it, that\\'s 99% of the reason for my purchase gone. \\xa0',\n",

       "  'description': 'Before Bad Company, Battlefield games were samey, faceless war shooters that... kinda failed to impress. I hoped that Bad Company would prove that DICE still had some tricks up their sleeves. And thankfully, they proved me right. I enjoyed every moment of Battlefield\\'s single player, although the pretty much unlimited auto-injector reduced the difficulty somewhat. The great thing about Bad Company is that although the online action is the centrepiece of all the previous games in the franchise, this time around Bad Company has a genuinely amazing single player experience. It\\'s strange, but hats off to dice for making a story the is just about as interesting as GTA IV\\'s one. Well, for me anyway. The contros are kind of clunky, but you get the feeling that that was intentional, and that they did that on purpose for the purpose of\\xa0\\xa0making it feel more realistic. There\\'s your \\xa0redneck soldier called Haggard\\xa0who\\'s the comic relief of the team and shares Jeff\\'s pro exsplosion agenda, then you have your sterotypical seargeant called Redford. Another great thing about this game is that\\xa0there\\'s no (Quote Yahtzee) \"Black and white \\'My country \\'tis of thee\\' jingoisim that you see in most war games\"(/Quote) It\\'s also genuinely funny and in some places, absolutley hysterical (Spoilers!) for example, the part where Haggard single-handedly invades a neutral country. There\\'s also some great fun to be had in the Multi-player. But here\\'s where the faults come in: The Unlock system is stripped down to only 3 unlcoks availible for all classes, and beacuse you only have one account and can\\'t create new soldiers the 25 unlocks are enough to purchase all the weapons. Also, on the larger maps, the only classes worth playing are the Recon class and the Demolition class. Another of Battlefield\\'s shortcomings: there\\'s only one class that can hurt vehicles to a satisfactory degree. But maybe that\\'s just me. Anyway, I loved this game, and if you\\'re a fan of Battlefield games you\\'ll probably love this one too. You know,\\xa0if you can forgive the slight dumbing down for consoles. And that phrase is not meant as an insult. If you\\'re new to the genre, 1. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? And 2: You could do a hell of a lot worse that this. Just, you know, go buy it. It\\'s a shining example of the genre, and it really sucked me in. -Aaox',\n",

       "  'description': \"As someone who was extremely disappointed with MGS2 and MGS: Portable Ops, I went into MGS4 with some trepidation. I've seen the good reviews of this series before. I've seen the rabid fan adulation before. And I've seen the basic MGS game mechanics before, which were always creative and interesting but ultimately a little clunky and awkward, especially compared to pure action games.As a pre-cursor to playing MGS4, I finally got around to playing MGS3: Subsistence a few weeks prior. I wasn't expecting much this time around either, but wanted to at least experience the plot points so I wasn't totally lost in MGS4. That said, Snake Eater completely blew away my expectations. The characters finally had room to breathe, felt three-dimensional and gave you reason to become attached to them. The storyline started slow, but gradually built up with a real-world resonance that eventually climaxed with one of the most dramatic, thrilling and emotional finales I've ever seen in a video game. And the action and boss battles were absolutely a joy to play. MGS3 is one of the most memorable PS2 games I'd ever played and raised my expectations tenfold for MGS4.After playing through MGS4, it's safe to say it not only met those expectations and met all the hype carried with its release, but exceeds that hype and those expectations many times over. This is an epic story-driven stealth-action masterpiece with so many memorable moments I'm still thinking of, days after finishing the game. Environmental setpieces take you across the globe. You'll be sneaking and shooting your way through a wartorn Middle East city, South American mountains, frozen Alaskan island, and the expected military compounds, on land and sea. Combat is enjoyable throughout, whether you choose to go pure stealth or full-on shoot-the-hell-out-of-anything-that-moves. It's hard to strictly go stealth because the game allows you to use dozens of realistic (and not-so-realistic) firearms and explosives. Boss battles don't quite meet the high mark set by MGS3, but are still creative and fun to figure out. The storyline carries you throughout, intensifying the drama surrounding your actions and immersing you in this ridiculously awesome world.That's not to say the game is perfect. There is some cringeworthy dialogue, some awkward side-plots and melodramatic sequences that will cue a gag reflex. Story exposition is fully drawn out, leaving you sometimes wishing Kojima would allow himself an editor at times. But the vast majority of the game reaches such dizzying heights, these minor complaints are insignificant in the big picture.As a gamer, I have to give thanks to Kojima and his team for crafting the most epic series and storyline I've ever experienced in my 20+ years of gaming. Absolutely mind-blowing. Well done.\",\n",

I bought it at release but never got the motivation to play through it, largely because I wasn't a big fan of MGS2's over-the-top storylines and heavy cinematic-to-gameplay ratio.Now a few days before MGS4 is released, I felt a duty to actually play through Snake Eater, and all I can say is I feel really, really, REALLY stupid for not playing this sooner. MGS3 is one of the most epic, satisfying, fun, thought-provoking, endearing and memorable games I've played in years. The storyline is grounded in reality with (mostly) believable characters that I actually grew attached to as the game unfolded. Kojima also balanced the action with exposition much better this time around. While the game starts slow, it builds and builds naturally throughout the game's 15-hour campaign and feature one of the most arresting, showstopping epic finales I've ever witnessed in a game. I literally could not pull myself away from the final 5 hours and wound up awake at 4 a.m., adrenaline rushing and honestly a bit melancholy at the final events in the game.An amazing experience -- highly recommended, especially to MGS doubters who didn't care for MGS2's excesses but enjoyed the core elements of the series.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"The Orange Box is the single greatest deal of this generation of gaming. Bar none.I am going to throw a little bias in here right off the bat and say that if you have a computer that's up to it (which is less and less of a problem given that the source engine is no longer demanding top-of-the-line systems to run it), the only Orange Box worth buying is the PC version. And why's that? Because the best content is the kind you can get for free and the only place you'll be experiencing the Half-Life 2 Modding Community in full force is on the PC.That aside, let's look at this package. You get five games in one delightful package, two of which I'm going to breeze over because they are Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2: Episode One, and they've had plenty of reviews already. But hey, they're two free games that you can give to your poor, unexposed friends if you already own Half-Life 2 and Episode One thanks to Valve's Steam Digital Distribution platform. It is a painless and almost immediate process to give any extra copies of games you may have picked up from the Orange Box and it makes for a great gift for any PC gamer you may know that hasn't experienced Half-Life 2 yet.But let's cut to the chase and talk about the new stuff: Portal, Team Fortress 2 and the highly anticipated Half-Life 2: Episode Two.One thing that you may quickly notice upon booting up after fudging with the installation (if you buy the retail copy, but already have a steam account, it takes a few minutes of fudging to actually install the game, but it works) is the introduction of achievements on the PC, so if you're someone (like myself) who will hound after achievements, you've got something to hunt for in all three of these titles- including escorting a hidden garden gnome to the end and sticking him in a space shuttle (no, I'm not kidding). But now we've got the game installed and we've noticed the achievements, so let's start talking games.Half-Life 2: Episode 2This is the Half-Life 2 we've all come to know and love, but now we're officially out of City 17 and in the great outdoors- but it is crawling with angry combine and antlions, so we're not out of the woods yet. We pick off pretty much exactly where we left Gordon and Alyx in Episode One. After crawling out of the train wreck that opens this chapter of the game, Gordon and Alyx being making their way to the Rebel Base- your overall goal throughout the game. But several minutes into the game, Alyx is attacked by one of the newest combine enemies in the Half-Life series, the Hunter. Almost immediately priorities shift and it turns into a race against time to save Alyx, unforturnately, this involves kicking over the antlion hill and then diving straight in. Gordon's trek into the antlion den introduces a few new breeds of antlions, including the still-growing grubs, the acid spitting workers and a very angry den mother. Without spoiling too much, after you're out of the den, your trek to the Rebel Base continues, and you're finally really exposed to the outdoor environments. While still being fairly straightforward in direction, the areas feel larger, and show off some of the newer features in the source engine, like HDR and motion blur. Along the way you'll get several chances to get revenge on the Hunters (they're smaller, blue, spine-shooting cousins of the Striders that we've already seen in the Half-Life 2 series) and get to try out the new, fancy Hot-Rod vehicle. The plot is amazing and has quite a few memorable twists and moments that you just have to experience for yourself.Visuals are still looking good, but showing a little bit of age now that the Source Engine is pushing 4 years old. And sound is excellent as always. The guns sound and look great and all of the music fits the mood of each scene perfectly.Thankfully, this time around Episode Two is longer than Episode One, but you still won't be getting the same kind of play time out of it that you did in Half-Life 2, but you at least get to enjoy things a little longer. All in all, if you were getting the Orange Box for Episode Two, you won't be disappointed.Team Fortress 2Welcome to a Pixar movie gone horribly, horribly wrong. Team Fortress 2's most distinct feature is its visual direction, which as I said, lends itself to a Pixar-esque feel- but Pixar this isn't.Team Fortress 2 pits you against an opposing team in your traditional game modes- Capture the Flag, Territory Control and Assault and Defend. You will be able to play as one of nine different classes, each bunched in groups of three into smaller categories: Offense, Defense and Support. Each class has a distinct feel and purpose, so you'll get plenty of playtime just learning and mastering each class. In Offense, you have the Soldier, Pyro and Scout. The Soldier is the tough, rocket-launcher wielding, foe blasting back-bone of an attack. The Pyro is the more durable, flamethrower wielding offense class, who excels at both close quarters attacking and defending and is the key class for flushing out enemy Spies. The Scout is the quick moving, fast striking and fast capturing offense class designed to take and take and take. Defense has the Demoman, Heavy and Engineer. The Demoman is the angry, black cyclopse (Go watch Meet the Demoman and you'll understand) who's got a habit of making everything go boom. He can cover pretty much any point and will make anyone sorry for trying to take your territory. The Heavy is a booming russian wielding an equally large minigun that rains down cover anywhere he gets planted, but even though he's the most durable class out there, he will only last so long against sustained fire. Then there's the Engineer. He solves problems. He can aid team movements with teleporters, building life saving dispensers and a vicious turret to guard anything that needs guarding. Finally the Support classes: The Spy, The Sniper and The Medic. The Spy has the ability to disguise as any class on the opposing team, adopting a name of someone on that team and allowing them to launch sneak attacks onto unsuspecting foes for an instant kill. Unfortunately the Spy is fragile and can easily be rooted out by a trigger happy Pyro. The Sniper is your standard comfy distance killing class, and is also not all that durable when it comes to close quarters. Finally, the Medic, who is arguably the most important class for any successful assault. He's armed with his Healgun and Syringe Gun to keep him going and keep everyone else on your team going as well, but that makes him one of the biggest targets out there.As of writing, Valve has released content packages for the Pyro and Medic, which will allow players to unlock new weapons for the classes if you unlock enough class-specific achievements and with seven classes to go and a thriving modding community, Team Fortress 2 isn't about to run out of content.PortalHello <reader name here>!

       "  'description': \"Unless the player has already played Myst on a PC or console first, there is no way this game could be nearly as enjoyable as a stand-alone. The touch screen (which isn't fully utilized because it only does as much as a directional button can) can't even make up for the\\xa0low graphics. It's possible the stylus is an easier tool then PSP buttons; even so, it's hard to say if that is enough of a perk.\\xa0Although I loved the nostalgia and still played all the way through, I have to say it was probably only because I remembered the way to get to where I wanted, and even the answers to most of the puzzles (or exactly how to find them).The multi-screen display would be much more useful if the zoom tool did more than make everything ten times as pixelled, but is rendered simply into the only way to read anything on the bottom screen or view maps and photos. Sometimes it wouldn't refresh to show animations or change in environment, which caused me to avoid using it for anything other than reading books.In the Selenitic Age, the tunnel maze was practically impossible because as far as I could tell, the memory couldn't stand up to holding all the information, and the game crashed several times. The only way I could get through it was drawing a detailed map for each stop, and saving, quitting, then loading for every 5 or so stops. There weren't many other glitches besides minor graphic ones that were fixed by turning away then back again. The main issue was the size itself and how inherently dark the world was (something every DS owner should know by now is not a good thing for this system).The game is still interesting and the puzzles are still fun, but unless a gamer wants a touch screen version of the game specifically, there is no reason why they should get a DS version of this game.\",\n",

The game just holds up brilliantly and is still the most unique of it's kind. The level of detail that was put into the level design, character AI, balance of difficulty, and especially the amazing story made it a significant achievement in gaming history. Half-Life 2 also had another great feature, and that was the inclusion of the top of the line physics engine provided by Havok. The level interaction between the player and the environment had never been seen before at the time that the game was released, and it is still some of the most realistic and fluid feeling experiences today. Overall, Half-Life 2 is a brilliant game that, just like it's predecessor, changed the face of gaming. It should be on every gamer's shelf by now.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'When I first heared about the Wii back at E3 2006, the first game I saw on offer was Warioware Smooth moves, and I instantly wanted to try it out. It looked just as crazy as the other games in the series, and seemed to make interesting use of the Wii Remoe. Let me promise you, this game does not disapoint.  The point of Warioware games is simple: complete a series of very short \\'microgames\\' that gradually get faster and faster, until you quite literally have just over 2 seconds to complete each game. You have very few instructions for each game, so you must spend your time figuring out what to do, complete the task, then instantly move on to the next game. The frantic pace is what gives the series its charm and appeal.  All the microgames make use of the Wii remote, and there is about 15 different ways to hold the remote. This ranges from simple poses such as pointing the Wii remote at the screen or turning it like a steering wheel, to downright crazy positions, such as holding it to your nose like an elephant. Once you complete the main game, you will unlock a section which makes use of the Nunchuck atachment. To be honest, a lot of the positions are the same basic concept, for instance one pose tells you to hold the Wii remote in 2 hands, where as you could just as easily hold it in one. The elephant pose can also easily be completed by simply pointing the Wiimote at the screen. But I think following the instructions correctly immeres you more into the game, and makes it more worthwhile.  The game starts off very easy; you have ample time to complete each task, there is no manic rush that fans of the series will love. But once you get about half way through the game the difficulty starts to pick up. Near the end of the game is the \"Super Hard\" level, which uses the full range of poses and starts you at an amzingly fast pace, which only gets faater. Once you complete the level the first time round, you can revisit it for an endless run, where the difficulty can pick up quickly.  Graphically, Warioware is by no way the most technically impressive game, and when compared to something like Gears of War, it simply pales in comparrison. But the ammount of different art styles used in the game is another strong point. The cutscenes use a very attractive 2D style; the sort of thing you might see on a Flash cartoon. The microgames themselves range from simple 8bit drawings to Gamecube-like graphics, and much like the microgames themselves, you really never know whats going to come next. Games like this dont need amazing technical graphics, and in my oppinion the simplistic style only adds to the game.  The use of music and sound in the game is done really well. Each microgame has its own little tune, and they all seem to slot together very nicely. Of course, as the pace of the games picks up, so does that of the music, adding to frantic nature of the game. Sound effects are all done well. They are nothitng revolutionary, but all sound right, and there is a great veriety of them. There is limited voice acting in Warioware, but all of it sounds good and professional. The best use is possibly the sleepy-sounding guy who explains the different poses. These short turorials may slow down the pace of the game a little, but are informative and very funny.  FINAL NOTES: If you\\'re a fan of the Warioware series, you will no doubt love this game. The same frantic, random gameplay is just as great as the other games in the series. It makes great use of all the Wii remote has to offer, and is great for multiplayer parties.',\n",

       " {'deck': 'dogsounds reviews: Medal of Honor: Airborne',\n",
       "  'description': 'So, it\\'s that time again when EA release another instalment of the long-running Medal Of Honor franchise.Many gamers bemoan the dearth of WWII shooters; they say the genre is milked to exhaustion, and that everyone should just move on. Well, EA obviously don\\'t think so, and I for one am glad. As I have written before, I quite like the genre, and you can guarantee I\\'ll never tire of it. And, despite all the naysayers, people still buy the games. Perhaps what people are tired of is not WWII shooters per se; just really bad WWII shooters. The Medal Of Honor franchise, has, over the years, slowly climbed down from an exalted position to a less vaunted place in the minds of gamers. When we first played Medal Of Honor on the Playstation, we were amazed by what the designers got out of the little grey box. When we first played Medal Of Honor: Allied Assault, we were awestruck by the beach landings and the immersion. It is no understatement to say that these early games were buoyed by renewed interest in the conflict thanks to films such as Saving Private Ryan.But then, alas, as with so many things in life, gamers\\' attention wandered slowly way from the war, and onto other things. EA were plucky though; they kept the war machine rolling ever onwards in the hope that the budding Allied troopers would keep coming back. Problem was, well, they just didn\\'t do a very good job of it. From the mediocre Pacific Assault to the lifeless Rising Sun, and then the utterly abysmal European Assault, gamers were presented with fewer and fewer reasons to actually cough up their hard-earned to play another instalment.When EA announced Airborne, they were up against it. The memories of so many bad games, the preference by so many for the young upstart call Of Duty series and a seeming general opinion amongst the game-buying public that EA just churned out unfinished nonsense meant that the developers were pinned behind a low wall with hella incoming MG42 fire. They had a lot to prove; and a lot of opinion to sway. So how did they do? Let\\'s take a look. In Airborne, you play Boyd Travers, a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne in mid-1943. The game will see you fight in 5 operations from the closing years of the war, from Sicily to Normandy, Holland to the Reich itself.Storm the beaches of Normandy...in reverse!The gameplay itself is standard fare – carry out several objectives in each mission, fend off hordes of Axis troops, try not to get too killed. As in most other Medal Of Honor instalments, you are not tasked with managing or protecting your fellow soldiers. And thankfully, there is none of the health-pack sharing nonsense from European Assault. However, what EA have tried to add to the mix is a new level of open-endedness in this hitherto very linear genre, in the hope of spicing things up. As you are in the Airborne, not surprisingly each mission begins with you parachuting into the map, able to control your parachute and decide from where you want to start your fight. You could drop into a safe zone, where you can be sure of supplies, allies and not being cut down the moment your feet touch the ground. Or, you can drop onto the rooftops for some safe, sniping fun. Alternatively you can be a demented maniac and drop right into the middle of a very angry nest of Axis dudes. EA say this means that you can fight however you want, tackle objectives how you want. Let\\'s go through the game and take it apart, see how it stands up. We\\'ll cover the main topics first.Firstly, we should look at this open-ended promise. The idea of landing anywhere and doing whatever you like in any order you like sounds great. It certainly would add a new angle to the tired first-person shooter genre. Well, it would, if it was actually as much of a liberation as it sounds. It\\'s not totally incorrect; there is a certain amount of latitude given to the player. In reality, you have a certain freedom to land within certain areas of the map. By timing exactly when you jump from the plane, and by careful control of the parachute, you are able to have a wide number of landing spots. But there is still some restriction, to avoid you landing off the map completely and breaking the game.At this point, you do not have a lot of options...Okay, so that\\'s not so bad. You still have a number of options to play how you want, right? Well…again, not quite. Each mission has a set number of objectives, which must all be completed. For the most part, you can approach them in whatever order you choose, although in some missions there are objectives that follow a cutscene, and these are not available till you have completed the ones before them. It would be cool to start Market Garden by landing on the Nijmegen bridge itself (and, no doubt, face certain death), but sadly that part of the map only opens up after a cutscene later on in the level. However, there is still a certain amount of linearity to the objectives. Although you can choose the order, to some degree the actual enemy encounters follow a set pattern, so you can take the same course of action each time, somewhat. Having said that though, what freedom there is still adds a certain variety to the proceedings, and it does give you the chance to switch things around and keep gameplay reasonably fresh. In an interesting twist as a result, each time you die you respawn mid-jump, so that if you died by being overwhelmed or using a bad tactic, you are given the chance to try and approach the problem afresh from a different angle.The six (yes, only six) levels themselves are pretty good. Having said that, they are a bit lacking up until the last two, where the challenge ramps up and the game becomes truly interesting. They are the usual assortment of place charges on X/destroy radio at X/activate X, but they are spread around enough to be interesting. I guess there is only so much you can reasonably offer to keep the objectives convincing for the era. Thankfully, there are no \"escort the bullet-sponge\" or time-limited objectives. Phew!Choose your landing spot - preferably not next to the sniper in the church tower...In terms of the enemies, EA has said that because of the \"start anywhere\" gameplay, they had to abandon the old-fashioned way of scripting enemy locations and behaviours, as you can now approach them from literally any angle. They created the \"affordance engine\", which essentially avoids traditional behaviour scripting by giving an NPC the intelligence to make its own decisions based on environmental affordances. In theory, if an AI is under fire, it uses the environment around it for protection and tactical advantage – it makes the most of the affordances the environment provides. If a grenade lands near him, he will move to get behind something to give him cover. If you are laying down fire in a doorway, the AI will try to path a different route to be able to get to you that will avoid that doorway (and ideally your allies elsewhere). Again, as with starting anywhere, this is a noble intention, and EA kind of manage to pull it off, but as before, there are still traces of the old-school way of doing things that are to be found. If the affordance engine worked perfectly, combat would truly be unpredictable and awesome. And despite the repetition in the enemy locations, for a big chunk of the time they do seem to exhibit behaviour beyond tighly-scripted actions. Where it fails a little is that the AI seems to only have a limited choice of affordances available; so the ingenuity of an NPC taking a clever path is somewhat dulled when five of his allies take the self-same path. And you take them all out in the same way, as they seem not to notice those before them being cut down. The intelligence of your allies is similar in that in can at times appear both very clever and infuriatingly dumb. Often, your squad mates will just stand right in your line of fire. More amusing is watching two NPC\\'s shooting at each other, three feet apart, and missing like their weapons have the kick-back of a mule.The design of the enemies is a little old fashioned, in that there are ten levels of \"badass\" to them, the most feeble being the level one Italian Blackshirts (which is a little ironic) and the hardest being the level ten Storm Elites – nasty fellows in black that wear gas-masks and carry MG42\\'s. A little bit silly perhaps, but then it wouldn\\'t be a Medal Of Honor game without a little diversion from reality here and there. Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on your point of view) the Storm Elites, although for some bizarre reason equipped with some kind of not-particularly-apparent anti-bullet clothing, are easy to take down as long as you can stay out of their line of fire or get some elevation on them and drop a few sniper rounds or a BAR clip into them. You will, however, dread hearing that damn gun on the last level.However, despite these shortcomings, gameplay can still be great fun. The default control scheme for Xbox 360 is clunky at best; I found that using Default Scheme 2 was a more intuitive and natural way to play. One thing that does work well is the use of leaning and sprinting. You can use ironsights to aim more accurately by pulling holding the left trigger. When you are in this mode, you normally can\\'t move (although you are able to walk slowy if you push the left bumper button in default control scheme 2), but the left stick becomes a lean function. You can lean to the left and right; pulling back on the stick squats you down, and (if you are crouched) pushing up pops your head up from the crouch position. I actually found this incredibly useful. Think of it a little like the cover mode in Gears Of War. Let\\'s say you crouch behind an object, above which your head sticks up just a little. If you go into ironsights mode, you can pull back and get totally behind the cover. Then slowly pushing the stick up means that you can pop your head up, take a few potshots at the Bosche, and then hunker back down again to reload. It\\'s actually quite flexible, and a welcome return from Frontline. It\\'s also incredibly useful when you are using a bolt-action weapon, and you can shelter whilst you load the next round. You can also sprint – with no time limit. If you are crouched when you sprint, you will return to a crouch when you stop – making nipping from cover to cover effortless. It is even awarded an achievement, as it integral to the way you play.Weapons are the standard WWII fare, although now you can upgrade them with authentic era modifications as you play.There is the usual assortment of arms: the classic M1 Garand, the lovely Kar 98 (which actually outclasses the Garand in this game), MP40, STG44, and so on. EA have managed to actually include a new weapon in their line-up – the M18 recoilless rifle – effectively an alternative to the tired old Bazooka, although sadly it is not seen all that often in the campaign. Each weapon starts out as a basic model, and as you accrue kills it awards you up to three upgrades. For example, the Thompson gets a front handgrip, for better accuracy, then a Cutts Compensator, to reduce recoil, and finally a 50-round drum magazine for…well, more rounds. In a good move, these upgrades are permanent, so once you have fully upgraded a weapon it will remain that way when you replay levels, forever, unless you start the campaign over again completely. Many people have lamented the accuracy of the weapons in this game – saying that sometimes a bona-fide killshot has no effect – and to a certain extent this is most true at the start, where your weapons have no upgrades. As you upgrade, generally most get better to a certain degree, although there still remain some issues with hit-detection. It is most noticeable when sniping across a long distance; sometimes the shot seems to have no effect at all on an enemy until you shift you position slightly closer to the enemy. This could be explained as the range of the weapon, but then I find myself standing on the church roof in Nijmegen totally unable to hit an enemy in a house across the street, when from the same place I can hit a Panzerschreck-wielding goon on the bridge, halfway across town. It\\'s frustrating, but not the end of the world.This nice fellow is obviously keen to direct you to the h\\'ors d\\'oeuvres tray...One really neat touch with the weapons is the scoping. When you hold the right trigger, you are looking down the scope. At first, your scope moves all over the damn place, so to steady your aim you must hold your breath. Now, unlike Call of Duty where you basically have an on-off switch, in Airborne there is almost a little mini-game feel to it. You have to gently squeeze the trigger, and as you do, two markers in the scope move together, the more you squeeze, the closer they get until they are locked and your aim is steady. You then pull the trigger all the way and BANG! And the Jerry is gone. Thankfully, the designers stopped short of putting windage and gravity in there too! For the audio, EA have managed a bang-up, top-notch job, and it is here that they start to recoup kudos points. Ambient environmental audio is encompassing and in surround sound sets the atmosphere just fine. EA have made a much greater effort with this game than in previous incarnations, recording multiple sounds for each effect. The sound of a panzer rolling ominously by is no longer a thin, repeated loop. Now it is a number of sounds meshed together, with an appropriate bassy boom and considerable gravitas. As a tank shifts across the terrain, you hear appropriate heavy thumps and clunks as it drops over obstacles, and all you are left thinking is \"this thing is very, very heavy.\" Weapon audio is great, and each weapon has its own distinctive report, easily distinguished across a busy battlefield. Distant weapons fire is appropriately muted (although the distant Thompson sounds rather pathetic, much like a typewriter – I kept looking on the screen to see if objective text was scrolling across or something), and most interesting of all is the change you notice when you duck behind over or when you scope a weapon – the sound becomes muted - with cover because there is something between you and the weapon; with the scope because all your attention is on your target. This game also has the most satisfying sound I have ever come across when you score a headshot through a helmet. Combat dialog is not too bad, although sadly like other Medal Of Honor games there is just not enough. Voice acting is well done, and it is amusing to see the same talent voicing the Axis troops as in the other games of the franchise, and even the Call Of Duty games. They must get around! But, in these days of games like Halo 2 sporting over 15,000 lines of dialog, it is a bit disappointing to hear the higher-level enemies in the later levels simply saying \"Da! Die Amerikaner!\" over and over. More attention is paid to the chatter of your allies, but it is still thin.However, it must be said that of all the audio, the biggest disappointment by far is the soundtrack. Despite a very good theme, not only does Michael Giacchino appear to have phoned much of the action music in – it is not as thematic or as textured as his earlier Medal Of Honor work; there is very little you can hum along to – a big chunk of the in-game music is actually recycled from previous games. In the Market Garden level, for example, you will here several parts of \"Kleveburg\", \"Emmerich Station\" and even \"Manor House Rally\", all from Frontline. Call me anal, but I really don\\'t think that is acceptable. A new game should have a new soundtrack. Re-using established themes is one thing – and I applaud the fact that the same themes are used throughout the games in the franchise – but using the same recordings is just lame. Shame really, as the soundtracks for this franchise were usually always outstanding. I would rate European Assault as one of my most-played favourites.Finally, onto the visuals. This game uses the Unreal engine, and it shows. Animations are for the most part very well done, and death animations are totally unscripted. However, unlike most games that ride on the Havok engine bus for their physics, in Airborne a body retains momentum and interia when it falls. So, if you shoot a dude whilst he is running, he will collapse mid-run and carry on forward, collapsing realistically. Shoot someone climbing over a wall, and you\\'ll see what I mean. It avoids going from live state to death state with a jarring movement (I\\'m looking at you, Halo 2) and adds to the weight and realism of the NPC\\'s. Sometimes a standing enemy will fly backwards when shot, sometimes they will just go limp and collapse. There are some clunky transitions, and sometimes an enemy will fly backwards a little too far from a pistol shot, but overall a lot of effort has gone into the realism. The change in the depth-of-focus when sprinting is also very pleasing.And the graphics? Well, some people hate them, some think they are good. My own opinion is that, some feeble textures here and there aside, the graphics are actually pretty good. Not the best ever, but good. Overall, yes, there are some poor low-resolution textures in there. But then you have to consider that on some of the maps, the graphics engine is rendering half a town. And with all that, I have yet to see any noticeable level-of-detail cheats. Character models are pretty good, and environmental lighting on them is impressive. Notable as excellent is the scope effect – rather than just blurring the edges, the designers have created very convincing true optical blurring, where focus is lost around the edges of the scope, and the colours shift subtly to the red. It is an awesome effect, and one I hope we see again. However, it has to be said that your character model is a little basic, and sometimes does not change with the ambient lighting – on the last level, in the sewers, you are in a room lit by red lights, yet your weapon does not appear affected. But then you pick up on the little details: the amount of debris in Nijmegen; the subtle texture on uniforms. I was amazed to see real-time reflections on the eyes of a dead enemy. To make sure, I zoomed the sniper rifle in and walked around him, and the reflections really did move around too. That\\'s a ridiculous amount of detail that no one will probably ever notice. It is also pleasing to see that the characters do not appear to have that \"slightly greasy\" look that characters in games such as Call Of Duty3 had, as if everyone was wearing rain-slicked gabardine. There are some texture clipping issues here and there – most noticeably again in Nijmegen, where wall textures appear to flicker through scopes, and where you will see mysterious semi-transparent walls in the middle of nowhere. But nothing that will make you throw your controller down in disgust.So, overall, is it worth you spending your money on? The campaign is very short – you\\'ll probably breeze through on normal difficulty in six to eight hours. Hit detection can sometimes be a pain. And the designers have not really made good their promise of true start-anywhere, open-ended gameplay. There is nothing really fantastically innovative about the game. However, the limited freedom you do get within the game means you are able to some degree to try different approaches, or try different weapon combinations. If you are an achievement whore (who isn\\'t?) you\\'ll probably play through all the difficulty settings to get the points, and there are challenges to be had. It is clear that, although they may not have fully succeeded, the designers knew what the Medal Of Honor franchise had started to become – a by-word for half-finished, rushed games – and worked hard to better that. And although not perfect, their hard work shows.Basically, if you want every game you buy to be cutting edge, and be chock full of things that are innovative and never-before-seen, then this may be a rental for you, at least to test the waters. But don\\'t panic, this is no Hour Of Victory shambles. There is solid fun to be had, and if, like me you are a creature of habit and comforts and simply like battling the Nazi war machine, and played Frontline over and over between Halo sessions back in the day, then you will want to pick this game up for sure.It is clear, with a little more attention to hit-detection, visuals and audio, and with a fully fleshed-out affordance AI system, this game could have been outstanding, and could have put the WWII shooter back on the front pages. As it stands, it is a good game, with much to commend, but with just enough to take the shine away and leave the future of the genre hanging delicately in the balance.Suck it up, Airborne, you still have work to do. This review ws written in Spetember 2007; the update below was written in July 2008:So, recently I have had what could be called a drought of new games. In an attempt to fend off boredom I started to re-visit some older games for shits and giggles. And doing so made me want to re-visit a review of Medal Of Honor: Airborne I did last year.   One of the games I played was Medal Of Honor: Allied Assault, and after playing that for the last couple of weeks I happened to return to Airborne today, and realised that my earlier review may have been a little harsh.  The original review - presented above \\xa0- was not really that harsh, I suppose. But it was critical of a number of things that, now I have had time to get used to them, are not that bad. I was amazed by a number of things in my return journey to Allied Assault. The first thing that shocked me was that I thought it was much older - I looked on the back of the CD-Rom box and realized it was released in 2002/2003. The last time I had played it was after release, and because of all the things I have done since then, I thought in my head that it was much older than that. Secondly, my memories of the visuals were not forgiving - I remembered really crappy graphics. But I was amazed to see that with all the settings at max, the game actually stands up pretty well - aside from character faces and muddy textures here and there. And the fact that everyone is doing some strange shit with their arms all the time, of course. But then I remembered - last time I played it, I had a PC that couldn’t cope with anything more than the lowest graphics settings. D’oh! Looking again at Allied Assault I found myself intrigued by the death animations of the NPC’s. Some were quite gruesome, and although a little speedy, they were all really good. Some of the muzzle flash lighting effects were very nice, and overall it looked great for what it was. I was pleasantly surprised. Of course, there were many things about it that, by today’s standards just sucked - all the animations were heavily scripted, there was no iron-sights option - a feature that today is lamentable if excluded - and some bloody awful sounds. The in-box M1 Garand sound was like some big, booming cannon, and made me want to avoid that weapon at all times (I resolved this by screwing around with some of the excellent user-created mods out there that add better sound effects, blood, better explosions and better textures. Oddly, people are still creating and adding\\xa0.pak files and mods for the game\\xa0even today. One source of note is Medal Of Honor Files, which covers all Medal Of Honor Games. I would recommend the High Definition (Fixed) Pack\\xa0and the MoHAA New Light Pack, both of which spruce up the whole game in a single mod). I began to remember why this game caused such a stir when it was released - not just for the Saving Private Ryan-esque Omaha beach landing level. And then I began to think about other Medal Of Honor games, and started looking for other stuff to play. I am a firm believer that videogame Nazis are without expection the absolute best ultimate bad guys to fight in an FPS. I never tire of World War 2 shooters, and had the urge to spill more Wehrmacht blood. I thought that I could slum it a bit and get Vanguard for my old PS2 - that wouldn’t make too much of a dent in already tight finances. But then I read the reviews and realised, hmmm, maybe not. But that started me thinking - after Allied Assault and Frontline, pretty much every Medal Of Honor game that followed sucked absolute ass. The reason for that is unknown, but many assume (probably correctly) that as this is an EA franchise, it was simply a case of the machine churning out sequel after sequel of a popular franchise. The mindset seemed to be one of “Hey, MOH:AA and MOH:F sold really well, let’s make a whole fuckton more!“. The result, it seems, was that small teams of developers were pushed to crank out more with limited timescales. The subsequent sequels all had that feel that they all should have had an extra year in development. That they had some good aspects, but seemed to falter on the really obvious things that no developer should ever screw up on, if they know what they are doing. As an example, look at two specifics: European Assault and Rising Sun. The former had awful visuals that were so unlike anything in earlier instalments - almost cartoony and PS1 like and didn’t even begin to reach the level of graphical clarity that Xbox owners had, by that point, come to expect\\xa0- that the immersion was ruined. A backward step from Frontline. Add to that the fact that they desperately tried to copy the Call Of Duty, allies by your side style of gameplay (and did badly), had the whole “sharing health” nonsense and, most infuriatingly, made dropped weapons unspawn after a short time - which meant that I got to a certain point in the game and gave up - the game was okay, I guess, but was not fun to play. The only good thing about the game was the soundtrack. As for Rising Sun? Well, do I even need to explain the pile of ass, monkey shit-fight that that game was? It had pretty much nothing in common with any other Medal Of Honor game aside from the tip font, and was utterly, utterly unplayable thanks to a useless movement and aiming system. I like shooting the enemy whilst moving through invisible treacle, NOT. And the cross-hair was the size of France…bwuh? If you haven’t played it, then go find it now in a bargain bin - probably about £5 - and try it. I would urge this, in fact for both these games. Strange? Not really. I urge this because it’s only when you have played truly, truly awful games that you realise how easy it is to screw a game up, and how valuable and nice even average games are in comparison. Oh, and add Judge Dredd: Dredd Vs. Death to that list. Play (or as near to “play as you can with this game) that. You will be a new gamer afterwards. Anyway, where the fuck was I going with this? Oh yeah. So, after reminding myself where the franchise had come from, and where it had ended up, I decided to go and takle a fresh look at Medal Of Honor: Airborne. I realised that I had judged the game only in the context of its peers, and not its own family. And you know? The game rocks. It has some issues, sure. But when in the context of its older brothers (or sisters…would games be masculine or feminine?) it is a very welcome return to the Allied Assault and Frontline part of the family, with modern looks and nice gameplay additions. I realised that perhaps I had underplayed some of the good points and overemphasized some of the bad. I felt bad. I\\xa0popped Frontline in the console for a refresher, and then went to Airborne. And looking at the difference, you reliase that Airborne is a very good-looking game. Not the best ever, sure, but the quality is high, especially for an EA Franchise, evil corporation mantle and all. From the reflecting puddles in the cobbles of the first level to the lighting from weapons fire, to the reflections in eyes on the NPC’s. It’s a vast leap from the older games. And, I would say, better than some of it’s contemporaries. Better than Call Of Duty 3, by far. I think the only way to appreciate the visuals is to take time in a quiet lull to actually look. I looked over a broken courtyard from my sniper spot in a tower, a half-track raised up in the air, mansion house in front, and was taken by the lighting. Great. I praised the audio in the original review, and I still do (though I still hate the Thompson firing a distance away sound, but as it is a recording of a Thompson firing a distance away from the microphone, what can you do?). I would say that this and Brothers In Arms: Road To Hill 30 have the only decent-sounding and convincing MG42’sof any WWII games (and BIA’s was a little too bassy). The death animations - that maintain their forward momentum - still amaze me. And I am surprised that no one else does this. The bad bullet hit\\xa0detection is not as bad as I remember - non-lethal headshots are still annoying - but you get used to it. And the AI of the NPC’s can be forgiven. Many modern games still use the old tried-and true methods of spawn and defend. The affordance engine, although\\xa0still nascent and not perfected, is a leap above some other, lauded games. Certainly, it is much better than Call Of Duty 4.\\xa0 And it should not be ignored that the game does have aspects that other current games are sorely lacking - such as the iron-sights lean feature. As I originally reviewed, this ability is fantastic, and I still love it and still find myself disappointed when a newer game does not have this feature. After all, in a firefight you don’t really want to strafe out from cover, fire, and strafe back. Similarly, when you are hunkered down behind cover you don’t really want to have to fumble for the crouch button to stand up into the line of fire and pop off a few shots, take a few hits, and then crouch back down again. I really, really hope that future MOH games retain this feature - it is one thing that sets this game out from the rest, and if we are lucky other developers will realise that. It certainly gives more fun to gamers in a firefight that not having it at all, or having the Rainbow Six-style change to third person (which is great, but not as sneaky or as much fun). So I feel compelled to acknowledge the effort that went into the game. The attention to detail and mechanic-tweaking that the developers carried out. For, better than anyone else, they knew exactly how far down the toilet the franchise had gone, and just exactly how bad the earlier games had become. They knew all the shortfalls and all the cut corners. They knew that in all likelihood a game along the same lines of quality wold possibly have killed the franchise stone dead. And most importantly, that they had a responsibility to resurrect gamers’ waning interest in the WWII era.  So I feel that the original review was maybe a little harsh. It’s not the best game ever, sure, but to be honest, I don’t know that any of those that are lauded as such have as much playability as Airborne. Once you have played Gears, it’s done with. Trade it in, stick it in a cupboard, whatever. Once you have realised that COD4 is fun but old-school in its linearity and static AI, you get bored. Once you have repeated the same thing over and over in other COD titles, you get bored. I never replayed Prey, and I got bored halfway through Rainbow Six: Vegas 2. And Half Life 2 and consequent updates felt more like a mandatory assignment (and are, I would say, the least interesing to play of all of these). I have found that when I am bored for something to play - in terms of 360 games - I usually find myself assaulting the Flaktürm again or raiding the industrial complex. And bear this in mind: I am a tried and true Halo player. I am not a big multiplayer fan (unless it involves LAN and friends and beer and pizza). I like to sit alone, immersed in the game world. But even I find that nowadays Halo 2 and 3 just don’t compel me to go back and play them. Haven’t played 2 in over 2 years, haven’t gone back to 3 since early this year. Although the freedoms in Airborne may be slightly limited, and not as\\xa0unlimited as they were\\xa0hyped, they are still greater than in most other titles. So I find myself, when bored, looking at my 360 game collection, huffing and puffing\\xa0and thinking “Nah. Nah. Mmmmm…nah.” And then I put Airborne in the\\xa0tray.\\xa0And Nazis begin to panic.\\xa0',\n",

This first installment in the new series, \"Tools of Destruction\", is a return to formula after the combat focused Ratchet: Deadlocked. Insomniac attempts to bring back what we all remember from the first three Ratchet and Clank games on PS2 and succeed, but do nothing more.The story is definitely more fleshed out this time around than we are used to. The game starts off with Metropolis, a staple of the Ratchet and Clank universe, being attacked. An emperor from a distant galaxy named Tachyon tells Ratchet to turn himself over or he\\'ll destroy Metropolis. The duo of Ratchet and Clank escape from the menace and are soon traversing the Polaris galaxy fighting pirates and discovering more information about the elusive Lombax and Cragmites.The first thing you\\'ll notice are the beautiful graphics both in-game and during cuscenes rendered using the in-game engine*. It has a distinct cartoonish feel and is close to Pixar level. It definitely matches the style. The world, for the most part, is rich with color and life. There are few boring parts visually of Ratchet and Clank.The gameplay is really fun, but still has the same problems the old games had. It\\'s got all of the great weapons you\\'d expect from a Ratchet and Clank game, but it\\'s light on platforming and is also extremely easy. I was hoping that now that we had reached the \"Future\" we\\'d get new gameplay, but it\\'s the same thing we had on PS2. The gameplay could definitely use refinement.All in all, this game is a great buy and anybody who\\'s a Ratchet and Clank fan or has kids can\\'t go wrong with this game.4/5*NOTE: The opening cutscene is rendered using the in-game engine, but is played as an MPEG to hide load times.',\n",

The characters I saw I thought will fit in well and were exited to see how they play out and who were going to be the exiting new unlockables for this new game.AFTER I GOT THE GAMESuper smash bros. brawl was everything I thought it would be except for the online. The online play in this game is VERY laggy you can't play super smash when it is laggy. I didn't like the fact that you could only play with the people that are your friends. You should be able to play worldwide.Now super smashes story mode is awesome it is so exiting what new characters your going to see next and in the end all the characters come together which was great. I thought the cut scenes were great to watch and I thought they were great. All of the characters had their own story behind them and was great going to all the different scenes and playing all different characters. The events in this game are great it is small little events that are fun to play just for a little activity. Super smash bros brawls quick play is so fun. You want to keep on playing to see what character you might unlock next. All of the characters moves had allot of thought into them and allot of possibility of moves to do. Every character has its own super smash, which I thought was a good addition to the brawl. There is so many possibilities of characters to play with witch keeps on bringing you back to play them. I like when sometimes when you beat something you achieve something like a trophy or a track of music for you to add to you collection.I thought that the controls with the wii remote were not so great it didn't really play out well. I used the Game Cube controller the whole time witch I think is the best way to play. The entire controller was laid out great and was easy to play. I thought that all modes, trophies and everything else in super smash bros braw was great and is a good game to add to the super smash series.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"The Pokemon series has always did and sold well. This one is no exception.Pokemon Emerald is actually a upgrade of ruby and sapphire rather than being a totally new game. The game have almost enough upgrades to ensure a second purchase.What's new and what's not?Found out below with a detailed review.This review will cover the graphic, audio, story, gameplay and the lasting appeal which will be covered in four different section.Graphic - The graphic have been upgraded from the previous version but still looks kinda outdated. The buildings and oceans are well-done but are not very detailed when you try to look at it closely. The graphic used in battles look very solid and so are the attacks.The weather in the game looks just as they should.If it is rainy,you'll be able to see your footprints follow you for a while until it is all dried up. Everything in this department from the last game have been updated but it is not up to the game boy advance highest quality.Audio- Most of the music in this game are very catchy especially the battle musics.The pokemon cry is also clear and the developer seems to be able to put it in just the way they wanted. This game have no voice over but that's because of space problem rather than laziness.Some music returns from the previous games but in a new version like the pokemon center and gym music.The music also changes in the mood of the game. As you are in a hunted mansion, creepy music will play which is a great to make the player feel the atmosphere of the game.This department is well done and is one of the strong points of the game.Story - The story is basically recycled from the other pokemon games.You start out as a new trainer who finally get a chance to go out and be a pokemon master.On your way,an evil team named team aqua and team magma have an evil plan to take over the world. In emerald,both team are enemies rather than ruby and sapphire where you only try to stop one depanding on what game you have.The evil teams are planning to control a legendary ancient pokemon which you need to prevent from\\xa0happening.Like the past game,eight badges are required to finish the game. Once you collect all eight, the elite four awaits you which are the strongest required opponent in the game. Like mentioned before, almost the exact same thing as the previous from the series.Gameplay - The strongest point in the game to say the least. The gamplay doesn't require much skills or reflex at all.Once you go to battle,four option will be given. Item, attack ,switch and run are the four options. Attacks gives you four moves to use and is customizable as you can choose the move you want depending on the pokemon.Items let's you use item like healing items and power up items.However,item can't be used on mutiplayer linked.Switch let's you choose to switch pokemon while in battle and run le't you run away from a while battle or a linked battle. This department is gold or at least silver.Lasting Appeal - The main game itself is pretty long and will probably take you 20 hours to complete which is longer than an average gba game. Collecting all of the pokemon will take you a while and once you complete the game,new pokemon will appear. Some of which is legendary and are only one in the game. All of this will at least take you more than 100 hours.Overall - If you have time to burn on your hands than Emerald is the game for you.You don't even have to be fans of the show to enjoy this, just as long as you like role playing game and replay values.The price tag is a bit high for a game boy advance game but it still might be worth it for those\\xa0die-hearted\\xa0pokemon fans out there. If your not a fan then a rent would be at best and if you like it, buy it. It may take a buy to beat this game. This is almost the exact game as Ruby and\\xa0Sapphire so it you play those, there is no reason to throw $35 for this update version.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'I finished this game awhile back, and I tend to agree with the review. Definitely more enjoyable than the first I would say is the bottom line for Condemned 2: Bloodshot.  Especially in terms of level design, surprisingly I really didn\\'t get lost at all in Condemned 2.  As this was a big problem in the first game due to the fact that the environments, while incredibly detailed, were also recycled a lot. This made it easy to get lost and think to yourself\\xa0 \"Have I already been here?\" constantly. Condemned 2: Bloodshot has an easy to access\\xa0 GPS system to help guide you through the levels. This would have been a great addition in the Condemned 1, but in this current incarnation of Condemned I barely used the thing because it the games levels are set up much more varied and streamlined.  The locations also set this game apart. While they may not most original idea\\'s, they certainly work in terms of the fright factor. A couple of the locales had me thinking \"Oh great, not this kind of place\" before I even started moving around the level. The lighting is also very strong in this title, and in many instances really has you wondering what is going to jump out at you momentarily. Many of the enemies character models are also tailored to the levels environments making already strong designs look even better. So yeah, the levels are really memorable and put together great.Of course the main reason you may love or hate the Condemned series is it\\'s fairly unique combat system. Smashing dudes in the face with blunt weapons has never been so satisfying or brutal.The sound effects and enemies reactions to being hit, while slightly exaggerated are great and come off as totally believable. Once you learn the nuance\\'s of the controls you can seriously do some damage and have a blast doing it.New this time around is a completely revamped meleecombat system beyond your basic punches and kicks. Now you can fill a combo meter, and when full if you time attacks just right and push the right combination of buttons you can do some series melee damage.I suppose I should also mention this game has guns. They work well and can be very effective, but ammo is usually short, and administering pipe/axe/crowbar/ect. beating\\'s is far more satisfying.  The story isn\\'t incredibly bad, and is a continuation of the first games. Of course, this means it isn\\'t incredibly good either. It does in fact have a few bright moments, especially during some of the investigative scenes.Good voice work and great sound design creates a great atmosphere for the setting and also helps move things along at a decent pace.I would also highly recommend using a 5.1 surround setup or better if possible while playing this game, because the sound designers really did a great job of immersing the player into the action in this area of the game as well.  In short: Come for the dark atmospheric brutality, stay for the fairly unique and satisfying combat system \\t\\t',\n",

You suffer from amnesia when you  go crash and the other survivors don’t trust you because you can’t tell them if your name was on the manifest. So you spend a good half of the game looking for the cockpit of the plane where you find your laptop. When Sayid looks at your computer he finds information about illegal weapons. After this you are basically an outcast until Juliet helps you escape. Ben actually gives you a boat and Locke tells you to go home because it is your “destiny”. You sail away………The gameplay sucked. You are just walking around through the jungle and trying to “discover your past”. To remember things you have to go into a flashback and take a photo to remember something, which annoying because you don’t know what to take a picture of. The only exciting parts is when you have to run from the black smoke and jump over stuff like logs. And when you are walking through the jungle you constantly have to hide in trees to avoid the black smoke. And you actually end up in the hatch entering the numbers so the world doesn’t end.

That game is in-depth while playing single-player, and leaves you breathless as the events unfold. The game is graphically beautiful, right down to the little marines you can see the minuet details.

You haven\\'t seen World In Conflict until you\\'ve dropped a nuclear bomb on someone/something, the shear explosion of the nuke will fill your screen and you with delight. Another amazing addition to the game is multiplayer. World in Conflict has a unique multiplayer playing style. You do not just build buildings and deploy units, in WiC you get \"points\", and with these points you are able to call in a dropship that will deliver them to the battlefield in 20 seconds. In multiplayer you go head to head with 16 players (8v8). Half take up the side of the Russians and half take up the side of the Americans. There is a lot to behold in multiplayer, with certain points to capture, while fighting off many other players and watching explosions and amazing tactical aids littering the playing field with explosions. Capturing certain areas gives you more access to drop newer units closer to the enemy, as they are pushed back.\\xa0 The longer the game ends up running, the more of a chance there is to see the devastating power of a nuke. Fans of strategy games, and games from Massive Entertainment (Ground Control I and II) will surely love this new game. I promise you, you will enjoy every bit of it. I give it 5/5 stars.',\n",

       "  'description': \"So, a game that takes the great gameplay of Guitar Hero, adds Singing and Drums, weekly new DLC, AND 4-player co-op? Sounds great on paper, but the experience is shallow and short-lived. ...Most of the time.Well, I'll start with the guitar. It's bad. Really bad. Hammer-ons and pull-offs are inaccurate, inconsistent, and sometimes hard to distinguish from normal notes. Anyone who has played Rock Band can tell you how the game just hates you. You will hit a note, you will KNOW you hit the note, but it just decides that you didn't. Also, pitch inconsistency. You will hear the notes in the song stay the same, yet the notes you have to play will change. And that makes no sense. Now, the guitar controller itself. Yeah, it looks more realistic than other guitar controllers, but you can't judge a book by it's cover. The strum bar doesn't click like the Guitar Hero ones do, and while that may save you from a headache or two, it's hard to determine how far you have to push it in order for it to register. Bottom frets? No thanks. Convenient, maybe, but they're smaller than the top ones, and you'll have to learn the correct fingering positions all over again. You would normally only use them in solos. And by the time you got your fingers down in the right position, you've failed the song. A useless feature. Bottom line, the guitar wouldn't seem as bad if Guitar Hero weren't the competition.Drums. Now, HERE'S a part of the game I can agree with. They're fun, but they suffer from the same accuracy issues that the guitar does, only slightly worse. The drums are basically the selling point of Rock Band, and for good reason. They're unique, and THERE ISN'T ALREADY ANOTHER GAME BASED ON THEM.Bass Guitar? Nope. See the guitar section. Plus, I swear sometimes on guitar I'm playing bass parts, and sometimes on Bass I'm playing guitar parts.Singing. Decent, but it feels like it was just thrown in at the last second. Once again, a feature that was outdone by it's competitors, this time by Karaoke Revolution. Plus sometimes it won't let you activate your Overdrive, no matter how loud you scream into the microphone.Now, the song list. At one point, you'll be playing Country, then Rock, then Punk, then Oldies, then back to Rock, then Metal, and some songs that can't be accurately described. Plus the song difficulties are inconsistent. Nearly all songs are incredibly easy, and the ones that aren't are incredibly hard. There's no median. But, all complaints aside, there are some amazing songs. Just don't kill yourself when you get stuck playing Fallout Boy. >.>Complaints aside, if you can get over the regular amounts of bull that this game sends at you every few seconds, you'll find a game that... well, just a slightly more-than-decent game. The drums saved this one. But if you have three friends, this is a great party game. The fun will make itself.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Chains of Olympus is actually the first God of War game I've played, so the criticisms of recycled gameplay elements didn't factor into my impressions. But even if I had played through the other GoW games, the core mechanics are so fun and intuitive, I doubt they'd detract much from the experience.This is pure action fun, accessible to a wide audience so you don't have to be a hardcore fighting genre nerd to appreciate the game in its entirety. It's an action game to be enjoyed, and I found myself laughing throughout the game at the over-the-top moves you can unleash. Boss battles are especially great examples of design, with a simple strategy to figure out and appropriately over-the-top button-response dramatic moves.You'll probably finish the game in under 10 hours. Normally I'd cry foul but with I felt like I got my money's worth with GoW: CoO. There's not a dull moment throughout the game. The limited number of enemies and mini-bosses get recycled a bit, so toward the end of the game, it gets slightly methodical churning through all the trash mobs, so if the game were any longer, it would get really repetitive in my opinion. At the current length, it's just enough to feel fun without excessively extended.Overall, this is my favorite PSP game to date and a remarkable achievement on a portable system.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Last year, NCAA Football 08 was a step in the right direction for making an incredible football franchise this generation. Many were expecting NCAA 09 to be incredible, with its new break away animation system, and other new features. Unfortunately, I could have had a V8, but luckily, NCAA football 09 is that great experience football fans have been waiting for.  The biggest step up for the franchise is in its visuals. Now, I know I always praise EA Sports games for being pretty, but this game is assertively beautiful. Player models all look sharp and crisp, they move smoothly changing animations, the field has the best looking grass of any game, lighting is stellar. Mascots are detailed, as are cheerleaders and stadiums. The game runs smooth at 60 frames (even on the Ps3 version). Although there is still a lot of clipping going on, none of it affects gameplay in the slightest bit. The game doesn\\'t look perfect, but this is the best looking football game so far.  A big new gameplay feature is the animation system. Players, running backs in particular, aren\\'t stuck in a set animation for each move, they are free to move as they wish. Controlling a ball carrier has never been better, and it\\'s never looked better. It can be a little difficult to pull off moves at times, but like most games, there is a learning curve. Quarterbacks move authenically, as do the men in the trenches. The tackling animations are incredible, as certain tackles actually look painful. The amount of mocap done is amazing, and mostly everyone moves realistically. My only complaint is the lack of running animations. Everyone still runs the same, and it looks a little awkward, but overall this is a huge step up from last year.  Momentum has been taken to the next level. Quarterbacks have a \"QB Quiz\" after an interception. They are shown a series of plays, and if they select the right one, they shake off the pick, and move on. If they choose wrong, their momentum moves down, making their accuracy erratic, and their cadence subtle. When offensive linemen allow a sack, their momentum moves down, making them more vulnerable. Running backs fumbling or receivers dropping passes effects their momentum. Vice versa, if they perform well, they are on a hotstreak, and their ratings go up, and they play better with more confidence.  The same can be said for defensive players. Allowing a big play makes them play worse, but getting a big hit or a pick makes them better. It\\'s a very dynamic approach to confidence and momentum, that works extremely well, and you will come to rely on.  What I\\'ve always loved about College football are crazy plays. Those are here in full effect. You have a ton of option plays, and you can return field goals. NCAA Football 09 captures the essence of playing on Saturday. The crowd has booming cheers that effect the way the other team plays. If the crowd is crazy, nobody is certain about where they are supposed to be, or even what the play is. The toughest stadiums to play in are not friendly. After touchdowns, you can perform certain school specific celebrations. Florida will do the gator, Boston College will pretend to fly around like an eagle. This is the most authentic sports game on the market, and it\\'s something Tiburon should be proud of.  Campus legend mode returns, with zero changes. You can pick a player and continue their careers, or you can create a player from scratch, take him through high school, find a team that wants you and play your career. It\\'s a good game mode, but it could use a face lift after this long while. You still cant\\' become a kicker or punter, unfortunately.  What is cool, is how momentum effects you on the field. It works just like it does in an actual game, but it\\'s more immersing when you are controlling just one player.  Dynasty has seen the most polish. Scouting is deeper than ever, as you schedule visits and phone calls with prospects, you can redshirt players, offer scholarships, the like. There are top 25 polls, and ESPNews from around the nation. Do your job, and the fans will praise you, don\\'t do your job, and you could see yourself out the door. You have the ability to take any dynasty online and compete with others, and you can finish any online dynasty offline. It will take up most of your time, and it\\'s shows tons of polish. It\\'s the next best thing to being a real coach.  NCAA Football 09 is a great game. It has tons of improvements over last year, and is a great step in an even better direction. It\\'s football season, and you need to get into it.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Video games as an art form is one of the most widely debated issues of the industry. The most accepted view point is that games haven\\'t been able to capture the level of high art. However, Persona 3 is one of the strongest attempts yet to combine subtle satirical nuances with a unique flavor and style all of its own.This game has managed to set itself above the rest through the use of beautifully crafted characters and story, a unique soundtrack, and gameplay that we\\'ve all come to know and love.To begin, the story of Persona 3 is unique in conception. Persona 3 achieves a distinct method of stroy telling by introducing a blank slate main character. No name, no apparent past, and a pen to forge the character how you seem fit. The game manages to delve into the realm of the psyche, allowing you to create the main character. The story seems to focus on the duality of the world, portrayed by a \"Hidden\" twilight hour that only appears to a certain few. Within this twilight hour are dangerous creatures that drive forward the story.In addition to the main character, the supporting cast is a strong departure from the norm. In most JRPGs, you have a stereotypical cast. However, in Persona 3, each supporting character has their own unique quips that add to how the story plays out. The cast ranges from a brainy, overcontrolling female, a hyperactive, sometimes eccentric punk, a brooding anti-hero, and many more. Aside from the story, the soundtrack also plays a large part in painting the tapestry in the game. The music in the game is an amalgamation of punk, j-pop, rap, and classical. The music changes depending on the mood of the situation, and it all seems to have a neon feel to it. The sound drafters did a good job of combining a large variety of music in a way that they all have something in common.Being one of the strongest assets, the gameplay in Persona 3 combines the combat stylings of the previous Shin Megami games with a spin of its own. You find the basic elements represented in this game from Ice, Fire, Wind, Electricity, Dark, and many more. The combat is fairly simple. You run around the labyrinth that is Tartarus avoiding or engaging enemies you see roaming the halls. Enemies you actually see, and not just random encounters that seem to bog down so many other games.In addition, your character can become stronger in many different ways. The governing feature in the game is the Personas. Personas are like the embodiement of your different character\\'s feelings and emotions. There are multiple persona types that you run into throughout the game. How you interact with your classmates and people around the city ultimately judicates how and what personas you use. This is one of the most interesting elements of the game. Whether you spend your time watching foreign films, playing games, drinking coffee, studying, or going to sports practice ultimately affect which personas you can use throughout the game. In conclusion, the game is able to combine a unique art style, soundtrack, and gameplay to create a great experience. The gameplay is indepth, the soundtrack is eccentric, and the story is a window into the human psyche that is shaped by how you play the game. All together, this is an amazing game. In can be enjoyed by a large variety of people; Those looking for an indepth satirical storyline with psychological elements, those looking for a great JRPG, or those just simply looking for a good time. Whichever one of those you are, I would recommend Persona 3 to anyone with a PS2. ',\n",

       "  'description': \"Grand Theft Auto 4 is a tour de force. You'll be hard-pressed to think of another video game that makes such a dramatic first impression. A massive, vibrant homage to New York City ... some of the best character development ever seen in video game history ... rock-solid game mechanics polished to a shine like never seen before in this series. A storyline that grips you from the start with characters that engage you .How could anything go wrong with this potential masterpiece?I hate to think it boils down to something so trivial ... but by the time you've made it through two-thirds of the game, opened Alderney and begin what you would expect to be the crescendo of the game's storyline, everything ... just ... peeters out. It feels like 90 percent of the work on GTA4 went into the first half of the game, but when it came time to flesh out and conclude the storyline, Rockstar just ran out of time or energy. The memorable NPCs you're accustomed to meeting turn into stock Mafia television archetypes. The plot turns from unique immigrant story and family relations into stock Mafia movie fodder. For such an amazing setup, it's disappointing the game doesn't follow through and give you that epic conclusion and finale you've put so many hours into discovering. Alderney itself also seems strangely under-utilized, especially compared to how chock-full of activity and gameplay that fills the rest of the regions.So certainly if all you see of GTA4 is the first few boroughs, this would certainly be one of the greatest video games ever created. But considered in whole, and the failed opportunity to close the game with as much creativity and brilliance as the beginning, it's hard to call GTA4 the masterpiece of gaming all the early reviews bestowed upon it.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Fable is a game where you control your character personality, looks, and whether or not he will be good or evil.\\xa0The game begins when you are a young child, and you are set on the duty to get your little sister a gift for her birthday. This is where the game first introduces you into the system of choosing whether or not you will be good or evil. You can earn the money helping others and being the good lad or you can be the village bully by beating kids up and helping others not so nice. Once you have completed your task they story deepens and you discover basically the main story of Fable.As you progress through the game you character ages, turning into a young child to an older man. This is first seen at the Hero’s Guild, when you skip into your teenage years and learn to master your techniques. You learn to use your sword, bow and will power. Controlling the powers is easy and not hard to learn. Its best you learn to master these skills for you will need them when you battle the diverse creatures you do in Fable. The enemies you battle are smart and seem to learn your moves. It’s best you learn theirs as well. The task and missions you do in Fable are based on you being good or evil. Sometimes depending on your status in changes the outcome of the mission and how it plays out. There are also side missions in Fable where you help the common villager and what not. You can even marry and shin your wife with gifts. Taking this is the Middle Ages you can have more then one wife in each town or village.\\xa0The sound in Fable is well done. The music changes throughout the towns and the Hero’s Guild and they voiceovers are nicely done also.\\xa0The graphics are not to amazing but they do the job. Fable's graphics do not focus on being realistic but more cartoony. This is not a problem, but actually helps the game feel more like a fantasy and not something in the real world. Controlling your character in the game is to hard either. Anyone familiar with The Legend of Zelda:\\xa0Ocarina\\xa0of Time \\xa0should have no problem playing the game. Fable plays pretty much the same way. Except you have magic you can use\\xa0against\\xa0your foes.Value, high. This game is not to long so you can go through this game a couple times. Each time through are sure to see something new, whether or not you chose to be good or evil this time round. Every time you play this game you are bound to look different and go down a different path in completing the game. This element makes the game fun and a new experience each time.\\xa0Lets not forget this game is an RPG. So if you are not an RPG fan you will have problems with this game. But to those you enjoy a good, but not overly complicated RPG this is a game you should be able to enjoy.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Every blue moon there comes a game that blows off the collective dust of unoriginality and breaks the mold. No More Heroes made a great attempt, but did it have the lung capacity to remove the moldy residue from the cookie cutter games we've been seeing lately? Armed with a lightsaber, some killer wrestling moves, great dialogue, interesting enemies, intriguing story, and a unique art style Travis Touchdown manages to atleast cauterize the wound.Travis Touchdown is the main protagonist of this avant game. He is also one of the dozens of unique characters that make up the city of Sante Destory. Touchdown is what you could call an Otaku, or American who has become obssessed with Japanese culture. Oddly enough, he also likes to watch tons of wrestling tapes. His odd character is also defined by the different people you meet throughout the game.No More Heroes, as previously mentioned, takes place in what seems to be an eastern city called Sante Destroy. You play the role of an assassion, Travis Touchdown, who is on a mission to become number one. Touchdown's motivations seem at first to be as simple as wanting to makeout with the other major character, Sylvia. Sylvia is the leader of what could be called an association of bad guys. Travis's job is to work his way up the ladder by battling through tons of lackies and interesting boss fights.The gameplay in No More Heroes could be labeled as Grand Theft Auto Lite. Sante Destroy is left open for Travis to drive around with his bike, the Schpeltiger. As you would expect from a sandbox game, theres tons of different jobs you can take on to earn money, upgrade your lightsaber, get new moves, etc. Whatever your poison may be, theres always something to do. Theres also tons of references to anime culture like Dragon Ball Z, snide remarks about video games like Duke Nukem Forever, and allusions to movies like Back to the Future 2. Your arsenal in No More Heroes consists of a lightsaber and a myriad of wrestling moves. The lightsaber combo mainly consists of typing a to perform combos, and you can also change your stance depending on how you hold the wiimote. Once you manage to stun the enemies you can perform grapples and icons pop up on the screen like live action sequences and allow you to perform body slams and the like. There is also a slot machine that rolls everytime you kill an enemy, and it can activate any number of special powers for Travis that are named after deserts and range in power.However, the game isn't without its problems. Muddy visuals, unresponsive bike controls, and a few plot twists that will either make you want to pull your hair out or fall out of your chair laughing. Theres lots of humour to be had in the game as well. The save system consists of Travis using portable toilets that are always in conspicuous places. Despite the visuals being muddy, the style of the visuals are unique to say the least. The overall presentation in the game is great.In conclusion, No More Heroes is a great game that manages to bring new things to the genre. Its also one of the few great third party titles on the Wii. It would be criminal for me to tell you not to get this game just for that reason. However, thanks to great characters, interesting combat, nice story, comedy, pulp culture references, etc No More Heroes is one heck of a game that should be enjoyed by anyone with a Wii......as long as you're this high.*Holds up you must be this tall to ride sign* \",\n",

       "  'description': \"Lair was hyped and hyped, but it just couldn't deliver. The game concept is refreshing and new, but it's incredible how much Factor 5 screwed up.  You play as Rohn, a skyguard for Asyliia, and your job is to kill those damn Mokai. Actually, the story in Lair was really good and well written, and gave the game a LOTR feel to it. The story touches on topics like genocide and trust, and it keeps you guessing who the bad guys really are.  Let's get the positives out of the way first. Lair looks fantastic. The water effects are very impressive, the character models look amazingly real for the most part, the dragons are detailed (thank God), and the worlds are vast and open. Lair also sounds incredible. The instrumental score never dies down and it feels very medieval. It highlights Lair's epic feel, and that it should, because Lair is a real feast for the senses.  But Lair is a game, not a movie. The controls in Lair are that you use the SIXAXIS to control your dragon by pulling left of right, up of down. And those controls work. But you feel like an idiot doing it, and your arms will get tired. You can breath fire on people and other dragons, you can swoop and pick up foes, and you can swipe the ground and take hundreds out. The 180 is probably the most flawed part of Lair. To do a 180, you need to quickly jerk the controller up. This NEVER works. Once in a million, really.  The camera in Lair sucks. It is all over the place, and never in a good spot when you need it. The lock on system works, but it isn't precise enough to do the tasks the game needs you to do. Sometimes you will need to lock on to a certain object, but your dragon is looking at something else, so when you hit the lock on trigger, you will be locked on to the wrong thing. This is very frustrating, and you will die many times as a result. My final complaint is the length of the game. I was able to beat lair in just about 7 hours. This is disappointing for a 70 dollar game. Lair has good production values, but i just doesn't give you enough bang for your buck.  That doesn't mean that Lair isn't any fun. It's incredible fun to watch the story unfold, and at times, when the controls work, the game really feels innovative and cool. Unfortunately, the controls don't work enough for the game to be credited with a good review. Lair is definitely a game worth checking out, because of its story, because of its graphics, because of its sound. And for those moments when it doesn't suck.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Actraiser was a pinnacle title in the SNES era. It was a defining video game, and is regarded as one of the single greatest games of all time, and not without good reason. It’s unique combination of God simulation and sidescrolling action were a new breed, and has not since been seen again. While not the most difficult game by any means, it’s held the test of time quite enviously. Actraiser casts you in the role of a God, Sir [Insertnamehere] - You will save the land of its evil monster reign, and create life in a series of different modes of gameplay. From your Sky Palace, you will choose a battleground, an area of land you with to combat the monsters and begin human life. Initially, you cast yourself down in a human warrior form reminiscent of Thor bearing a winged helmet, long blue tunic, and broadsword, in order to fight off all of the monsters in the land. Each act has you finishing off the area with a boss fight in the form of an epic beast, from minotaurs, dragons, and fierce animal hybrids. While the boss fights begin a tad difficult, you soon learn the pattern of your enemy, and with earned magic and brute force you can easily take them down. Levels themselves aren’t all that difficult, and are riddled with power-ups for your sword and magic abilities to aid you in your quest. Once you’ve taken out the monsters headquarters, you can now move away from the gorgeously colorful 2D sidescrolling action to a birds eye view God simulation mode. From here, you will control your angel, who is essentially your right hand man in a series of events with a set amount of skills to help provide a peaceful land for your people to live in. The people will build homes, farms, and eventually cities. They will learn from you as you protect them by battling off enemies from the skies with a bow and arrow, and seal off monster lairs and make them homes. Performing miracles is essential to life, and for destroying rocks or unnecessary bushes, or sand, you will be rewarded with the peoples findings, be they bombs to destroy enemies, new magic, or things you can bring to previous cultures you’ve saved and created, like music and wheat.For the most part, there’s no real story save you creating life and defending your people that the player is ever told outside of the instruction manual. Every so often however, small sub-plots among the people will arise, be they missing men and children, plagues, or feuds, you will deal with these through your menus with your angel counterpart. Your menus are a one-button press, and are very easy to navigate through as you command your people to expand and build, as well as perform the aforementioned miracles. Again, since you’re a God, the most part is aiding your people from the sky and watching them. You’ll notice neat little things like farmers farming, or children walking the dog - it’s difficult to see anything from the birds eye view, but you are looking down from your Sky Palace. This is all very easy, and time consuming, but shockingly addictive. Every province has two action acts, and before you can partake in the second one, you must help the people reach a great goal, like creating cities, and bringing music to themselves - after this, you are able to fight again. However, I found myself continuing my building, and helping the people grow fields and such. I complete my province, filling it with people even before I help them again. It’s a very addicting game, despite its ease. In both the simulation and Castlevania style action sequences, you will notice backgrounds that stick out to you, some more gorgeous than others, but all of them suiting and acceptable. The overall look of the game is clean and polished, but the music is what stands out. Orchestral symphonies play as you battle your way through the evil waves of enemies, and help cultivate land. Memorable tunes that, should they be taken out of their MIDI format, would make excellent Hollywood soundtracks for an epic film.Actraiser was an early SNES game and will forever stand out in video game history. That it’s now available for 800 points on the virtual console justifies anyones Wii purchase. It’s a defining game in video game’s history, and is well worthy of a next gen sequel. Until then, I’ll be playing this well aged sim/action hybrid for a long time.',\n",

The story is fantastic and is far more straightforward than the story presented in Metal Gear Solid 2.There aren\\'t many \"WTF\" moments (If any), but the story will keep you at the edge of your seat.And with any MG game, there are the expected Plot twists.Delightful.  === What\\'s New/ Game play ===  Here goes...  As with any sequel (or Prequel, rather).There are always bound to be new features.For Metal Gear Solid 3, the biggest are the addition of the Survival Viewer, Stamina, CQC and the abundance of Outdoor Environments.Dramatic changes to the game play.Kojima wanted absolute realism with 3, which makes this game all the more better, and at times, frustrating.  Pressing START takes you to the Survival Viewer.I\\'ll break down each soon.Here you can Eat food, (Yes, Eat!), CURE, manage your backpack and change your Camouflage.You can also view the Map from the screen.There is no true On Screen Map, as this is the year 1964 and the technology of the Radar shown in MGS1 and 2 do not exist yet.So you\\'ll have to make due with looking at the map by pressing Start Continuously.It\\'s not as annoying as you would think, actually.Going to your destination is usually pretty straightforward.  A huge change is the addition of Camouflage.Now through the game you can acquire different Camos and wear them to blend in with the environments,(Such as Jungles, Rivers, Caves and Bases) and avoid enemy encounters.Quite literally, the definition of Stealth.How well you blend in with the environment is shown at the Upper right corner of the In-Game HUD.It can range from Negative numbers all the way up to 100%.Different environments require different Camos and Optimizing them for each area is crucial if you want to avoid being seen.It\\'s a great system that works.  Another change is the addition of Stamina.Underneath your life Bar, you will see a much a thinner bar.This is the Stamina Bar.This is something that changes the game completely.As you run, this Bar will decrease.When it\\'s depleted, you\\'re done for.To avoid it being drained completely, you can decrease the amount of items you hold in your backpack.That\\'s right, Items now have weight.*GASP!* Holding too many in your backpack will drain this bar quicker and having as little as possible will make the drop barely noticeable.  Whether you like Stamina or not, it\\'s crucial in this game.And without it, your life bar would not be restored.Yes, Stamina restores Life.Depending on how full the bar is, you life will be restored at a very fast rate or a very slow one.Because of this, the game will force you to play a literal waiting game of hiding from enemy soldiers while you\\'re out looking at the screen waiting for the LIFE bar to be restored.It gets annoying.Fast.It\\'s not fun looking at the screen waiting for it to be restored.  You can also now hunt for food.This the \"EAT\" in the Survival Viewer.Different foods restore different amounts of Stamina to barely noticeable to restoring a large amount of your stamina.Hunting for Food is a nice addition to MGS3.But, be careful the food can rot, leaving you with a stomach disease that must be cured, or the Stamina bar will begin to deplete quickly.Which brings us to the CURE Menu.A new addition to MGS3 is that you can be afflicted with \"diseases\" and wounds that must be cured that if not taken care of, will drain Life and Stamina  You open the Cure Menu and you are shown a model of Snake (Cool, huh?) and said wounds.Then you go to each wound, are shown symptoms of each and then you have to cure them with the items you have.While it sounds awesome in concept, it gets annoying fast.It\\'s not you pressing one button and it\\'s over.A wound at times must be cured in 4 parts or more.Bandage this, Suture this, disinfect this, remove this.It will get annoying, and you will suffer wounds like this often, so you\\'ll have to go into this screen quite often.The addition of Curing wounds is realistic, but is incredibly tiresome.  The final new addition is CQC, or Close Quarters Combat.In 2 and 1, you were able to grab enemies and perform choke holds on them to knock out enemy soldiers.MGS3 improves on that heavily.You can now interrogate Enemy Soldiers for information regarding your objective, cutting their throat, performing various throws and the like.It\\'s a whole new playing field to hand to hand combat.All the Weapons are great, from your tranquilizer gun all the way to an RGB.There are some new neat additions, but Suppressed weapons have a limited durability, which is slightly disappointing.  But, let\\'s not forget the mini-game, Snake Vs Monkey.Just a humorous extra where you capture the monkeys from the Ape Escape games.Not the most fun part, but it\\'s something fun to do when you dont want to play the main game immediately.Those are the new additions to MGS3.Tossing that aside, the core game play is still the same as MGS1 and 2.Sneak to your objective, avoid being seen.It\\'s not something that bores me and especially in this game, is executed very well with the addition of Camo and the addition of CQC.   ===  The Visuals and Sound ===  The Visuals of MGS3 are fantastic.For a game that was released in 2004, it looks amazing.And for even today\\'s standards, it looks amazing.However, it surely won\\'t WOW you like Metal Gear Solid 2 did in 2001.But still fantastic, nonetheless.To the Character Models to the Jungle Areas and even the urban ones, the game looks superb.The amount of detail presented is unbelievable down to the nitty gritty.The cut scenes are still sometimes long, but for me, they are a joy to behold and only make the game stronger in every aspect.  Plus, they really aced the camerawork on this one.The lipsynching with the characters are a bit better than it was in 2.And it\\'s awesome how in the cut scenes, Snake will be wearing whichever camo you\\'re using for the game play.Being able to zoom in and out with the camera in cut scenes is also a very nice addition and enjoyed as well.MGS always gives you the impression that you are in a Movie, and MGS3 truly pushes that.  As for Sound, you should expect no less from Metal Gear Solid.Harry Greggson-Williams does another fine job with this game\\'s soundtrack.Incredibly top notch voice acting, with another fine performance by David Hayter.Not to mention the music in-game are always memorable for each situation that follows.The Song that plays in the intro alone is on it\\'s own amazing.It\\'s clearly an homage to the James Bond Films, and this game itself has that feeling making you feel like you\\'re in one.  === Final Thoughts ===  The game itself will keep you busy for about 15-20 hours on a first play through while viewing all the cut scenes, and feels longer than the previous 2 entries.The atmosphere and gameplay is fantastic.All in all, MGS3 is another fine entry into the series, and all the new changes although a minor few are annoying are very much welcomed..Even without the title \"Metal Gear Solid\", it would still be excellent on it\\'s own.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Assassin\\'s Creed. People have been raving about it ever since it was first announced. The first trailer implied that you would be able to kill anybody, and disappear into a random crowd as one of them. Showcasing some top notch AI, and amazing crowd gameplay mechaty on just who to trust. Is your leader really the man who should be leading? Or are the scum of the earth lying to you? The story in Assassin\\'s Creed is really well told, at a pretty good pace.  Ubisoft Montreal decided to unload a big twist in the first five minutes of the game, but for those of you who don\\'t know yet, we won\\'t spoil anything for you. -SPOLIERS AHEAD- Just kidding.  The game kicks off with Altair not following the rules of the assassin\\'s creed, so he is punished, and is stripped of all his rankings and equipment, and basically has to start of as a noob all over again. The assassin town of Masyaf, is attacked by Robert de Sable and his army. Afterwards, there are rumours of a traitor within the city, and without anything, Altair has to go and scope this guy out, and bring him to Al Mualim, the assassin leader. This is a tutorial mission, and shows you the basics of everything. nics, Assassin\\'s Creed was prone to become one of gaming\\'s best. Although, that\\'s not particularly true, Assassin\\'s Creed is still a refreshing, crisp, beautiful next gen experience, and is one of the best action games of 2007.   You play as Altair, a 12th century assassin. The holy land is being ravaged by war during the third crusade, and is being torn apart by corruption. As Altair, you are given a list of nine men, who really are a bad influence on the world, and you need to pick them all off one by one. That may sound totally shallow, but actually the story is very deep, as each man you kill just furthers your curiosi The controls in Creed are really inventive, as each face button is used to control Altair tediously. One button is used for looking around, and the two side face buttons are used to control Altair\\'s hands. One controls his armed hand, and one controls his unarmed hand, which is used for gently pushing civilians out of the way. The bottom face button is used to control the speed of Altair\\'s walking. When not holding down the right trigger, Altair is in low profile mode. This means that he\\'ll walk at a normal pace, and not bump into anybody, and this is good for when you are trying to remain anonymous. When the right trigger is held down, Altair will start running, bump into people, but he will be the dangerous badass he\\'s supposed to be. This is great when you are running from pursuers, attacking, or chasing down a target. There is a pretty good learning curve, but you should figure out how to kill pretty early in the game.  Each city in AC is huge, and full of life. Damascus, Acre, and Jerusalem are where you\\'ll be doing all of your assassination missions. Each mission starts off with you speaking to the assassin bureau leader of that city about your target, and he\\'ll tell you everything he knows about your target. He\\'ll tell you stuff on where you can find witnesses, and where he thinks the target should be. He\\'ll then give you leave to go, and find out when and where to strike. Climbing all the tallest areas is the best way to start, as it points out where witnesses will be. The mini missions are necessary in completing the mission, and these include pickpocketing, eavesdropping, and intimidating witnesses so they\\'ll spill some juicy info. Pickpocketing has you following a guy for a little while, and pickpocketing at the right moment when he isn\\'t looking. Eavesdropping has you sitting on a bench and listening to some guys talk it out, while intimidating has you best the living hell out of a guy. None of the three are particularly game sellers, but they get the job done by setting the mood and realism of the situations.  After doing two or three of those tasks, you may return to the bureau and let the dude know you know when and where and who to strike. Among arrival at the target, you\\'ll witness some events that highlight just how twisted they are, and let you know that they need to die. After the cutscene, there\\'ll be a few ways to kill your target, and the fun is picking which one to take. Either running through the crowd, or going around the side, or leaping on him from above, the choice is yours.  After you do your biz, you\\'ll need to run from anybody who opposes you. The best way is booking it to the roofs, and then hiding in a roof garden. However, if you choose to take the streets, and get caught, Altair can really hold his own. The combat system is by far the best part of Assassin\\'s Creed. When you have all your abilities, you\\'ll be able to dodge attacks, break grabs, and counter moves defensively. The animations are super slick during the fighting, and Altair looks like he\\'s been trained by the choreographer for the Matrix. Instead of explaining, just take a look.  Graphically, Assassin\\'s Creed is really, really, really hot. The cities look absolutely phenomenal, the water is good, the character models are great, and the animations in climbing, fighting, and just plain moving are some of the best ever. Unfortunately, the frame rate in Creed is really sub par. When running from rooftop to rooftop, sometimes it will drop into the single digits. This is a little frustrating, since you are trying to be quick and smooth, and here, your character on screen is warping across the city. This only lasts a few seconds, and luckily, the framerate is silky smooth during the fight sequences, which is the best part of the game. Climbing is also unplagued by this issue. It\\'s a real shame, though, that such a pretty game is f**ked up by a stuttering framerate.  Assassin\\'s Creed sounds just as great as it looks, with some great voice acting from the smallest parts. Each line is hit perfectly, and people will talk about their daily lives to each other, and will say things like \"What the hell is he doing?\" as you bump into people, and climb up walls. The instrumental score is mostly original, and has a unique tone to it. It\\'s orchestral, as well as digital.  There\\'s really nothing else to say about Assassin\\'s Creed, other than it\\'s a great game with a few nagging flaws keeping it from perfection. After beating the 12 hour game, you\\'ll stay away from it for awhile, and then come back when you\\'re in the mood for killing. It\\'s ideas are fresh, and are pulled off pretty well. There is really nothing else like Creed, so really give it a buy. You won\\'t regret it.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Pros Updated look that\\'s a welcome change. Catchy soundtrack. The new features and game modes are a fun addition.  Cons Ghosts are just as frustrating as always. Dieing in this game is harsh.  Pac-Man Championship Edition is a revival of the classic game that I feel is the best in the entire array of Pac-Man games out there. This release for the Xbox Live Arcade costs 800 Microsoft Points ($10), is Single-Player, has 6 new game modes and an array of achievements.  Championship Edition changes the gameplay for the better. A new feature includes the ability to spark, which is achieved by pressing the direction you\\'ll be heading in before you actually get to the turn. This spark gives you a small boost in speed but it\\'s definitely useful to get away from the ghosts.   Next up is the ever-changing game board. The basic concept is whenever you clear one side of pellets and grab the fruit on the other side, the cleared half will be refreshed with new pathing and pellets adding a lot of strategy. Other than these additions, you\\'ll notice most of this game is very much the same.  The new modes are varied and a fun take on the series. You\\'ll have a couple modes to choose from but you\\'ll notice all of these are time-based instead of level-based. The simple reasoning is you have the new board that\\'s constantly being updated and changed.   To keep you busy the modes are frantic and fast adding different mechanics such as turning off the lights to say the least, where you are thrown into the normal level, all light being taken out (you can still see ghosts, pellets, and yourself) and giving you a small circular light to help you guide yourself. Or they just start you off at the fastest speed that\\'s especially unforgiving. Nothing extremely innovative but it\\'s much better than the same old Pac-Man formula.  The graphics are very bright and crisp showing this game wasn\\'t just rushed like the previous Pac-Man XBLA installments. It\\'s just an update that this game really needed to stay alive and is awesome to see.   The sound work is equally great. Pac-Man clamping down on some ghosts has more oompf, you\\'ll hear a swish when half of the board is changed, and the soundtrack keeps your palms sweaty and the blood pounding. Granted, you won\\'t have a heart attack but it gives you a nice pace to keep up with. A subtle but appreciated touch is at the menu screen, where scrolling through options and modes will greet you with that familiar \"wakka wakka\" sound.  As an overall package, this is a definite buy if you have not experienced the game in a while. Championship Edition should be seen as a reminder of a classic game with a modern twist. Therefore, if you have the points why not play a game embedded into the childhood of gaming.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Uncharted is one of the best looking console games around. Everything reflects in the water as it ripples, the lush, jungle environments are hard to ignore, the explosions light up the screen, the character animations look incredibly organic and real, the vistas are great looking, the buildings and caves are brimming with detail, the lighting effects are more than stellar, and it does it all at a silky smooth frame rate. Uncharted is the kind of game to make your mouth water, and make long run on sentences explaining just how great it looks. There is no doubt that Naughty Dog is one of the first developers to really utilize that little thing called the Cell Broadband.  From the opening cut scene under the Pacific Ocean, you can already tell that Uncharted is a pretty game. The game kicks off when Nathan Drake, a tough young fortune hunter, and news reporter Elena Fisher uncover the empty coffin of Sir Francis Drake. They find Drake\\'s diary, which they believe can lead them to the lost treasure of El Dorado. Shortly after, their boat is attacked by multiple pirates who want that diary and the treasure. Here\\'s where the adventure begins, grabs you by the throat and never lets go.  The story in Uncharted is really top notch, supported by superb voice acting, and nice facial animations. Nathan and Sully, are on the trail of El Dorado, and news reporter Elena has tagged along for the story. Unfortunately, things are never easy for the trio, as they are constantly being swarmed and chased by these gun wielding pirates, who are henchmen of an old \"friend\" of Sully\\'s. Early in the game, the trio get separated, and eventually the story opens up. Everyone on the island has their thoughts that maybe the island is \"cursed\", there are large trust issues inside the groups, and overall, the story is told at a fast paced, Hollywood style way.  The variety of the gameplay in Uncharted is really nicely sorted out. Mainly, this is a third person shooter, using the same camera mechanics of Kane and Lynch, Gears of War, or Mass Effect for the aiming. Luckily, the aiming is silky smooth, and you should be capping pirates through the forehead in no time. There is a large arsenal of weapons to Nate\\'s disposal at anytime in the game, although he can only hold 2 at a time. There is a variety of pistols, grenade launchers, shotguns, assault rifles, and there is even a magnum. At a few uncommon instances, if you are lucky enough, Drake will be at the helm of a turret, and a seemingly endless swarm of enemies just keep coming for more. Awww yeah... There are a few missions, where you are driving a jet ski upriver, while blasting enemies on the river bank. These are really well choreographed, and are fun at that. The one mission that will have everyone talking is the getaway mission, where Elena is driving a jeep at top speed through the jungle, on a cliff, through waterfalls... and Nathan is on the back, with a machine gun, and a grenade launcher shooting at ATVs chasing you. And trucks will also be chasing you. When these guys blow up, it really looks phenomenal, at a fast pace, and it really makes you feel like you are controlling an action film.  Most of the pirate battles will have you taking cover Gears of War style, and popping out at the precise moment to take down enemies. These guys have unlimited ammo almost, and their AI is pretty good, as they will try to flank you with grenades, and won\\'t just run out into the open begging to get shot. The tough guys with the shotguns might, but they have to prove they are tough. Until they\\'re dead. These battles occur frequently throughout the game, but don\\'t slow down the pacing. These battles are incredible fun, and that\\'s good, because they are what the core gameplay is almost entirely consisted of.  When you aren\\'t capping pirates, you will be platforming through the jungle. There are many cliffs and walls to be scaled, waterfalls and rivers to jump, and even many dark caves to be explored. The animations are great, and make what Nate\\'s doing seem real. There is some variety in this, even, as there are wide open areas to be explored, there are traps to evade, there are cliffs to jump, and there are even a few side scrolling old school parts a la Mario.  The story is really fast paced, and has some signs of horror near the end. The whole game, you\\'ve been playing a certain way, and near the end, the theme of the game is completely shifted, as there are 2 big twists that happen almost simultaneously. It\\'s really perfect when it happens, and it will shock anybody who it hasn\\'t already been spoiled for. I know it shocked me.  Uncharted isn\\'t relatively easy. Nathan will die a lot your first time through. That\\'s because the pirate battles are pretty tough, and maybe a little frustrating at a few points in the game. This is what keeps the game from perfection. You won\\'t hate it, but it will definitely keep you on edge. Luckily, the plot twists shake things up to keep you awake. The game takes about 8 hours to beat the first time, but there are 4 difficulties, and there are many unlockables. There are 60 treasure spread throughout the game, and finding them gets you points. The most points you have, the more content you unlock. There is the ability to play the game in a mirror world, where everything is sort of backwards, and this is a little trippy at first, but really cool. There are also challenges like killing 50 guys one way, or beating up 10 guys this way, and it is a good motivator to play through the game at least twice. There are a lot of bonus videos and art to get, so you will play Uncharted at least twice through. Adding to that, the game is simply so much fun, and that is worth doing the game at least 3 or 4 times. It is really one of the best Ps3 games, and possibly the best action games ever.  Uncharted is one of the prettiest games to ever grace the gaming world, and it is also a non stop action ride. Unfortunately, it is over a little too soon, but that\\'s not necessarily bad, as there are plenty of unlockables that will keep this game in your Ps3 for a long time. The production values that went into this game are astronomical. The variety in gameplay is welcome, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Without a doubt, Uncharted is a must buy for ps3 owners, or just plain action adventure fans.',\n",

       "  'description': \"The Elder Scrolls IV Oblvion is an amazing RPG. It takes place cyrodiil, the capital province in the fictional land of Tamriel(The entire planet the series takes place on is Nirm if you want to go more to detail) It is on PC, Xbox 360 and PS3.The land of Cyrodiil is huge... a little too huge. It's great that they made such a large area too explore, but most of it are just forests. Although the forests are different in every general area which is nice.Oblivion's gameplay is great. The combat feels realistic and intense. The only problem with it is that when you have allies you may hit them instead. Otherwise there are tons of magic spells you can learn which are set into catagories like destruction restoration etc. and you can even enchant your weapons and harvest plants and brew potions.Aside from cambat,harvesting and brewing you can do many other things like purchasing homes that you can customize and purchasing horses that you can rise. Or you can steal things. there are also 100s of hours of quests and thats not just the main quests. There are side quests you can get from citizens and there are guilds you can join.Oblivions graphics are amazing, simple as that. Everything is very detailed and the game has great real time shadows. The graphics still look great today. If I wrote this review back when this came out it would definatly score a 10/10.The game has an amazing soundtrack by Jeremy Soule. The voice actors did a great job the only problem is... there's not alot of voice actors, so your gonna be hearing tweo different people talking exactly the same. Also The sound effects are great too but I wish there was just a few more because when you swing your sword against a tree it sounds exactly the same as swinging it against the ground, but its not that bad and it doesn't effect the score at all. If there were more voice actors sound would have scored higher.The story is pretty good but it felt like it was over too quickly. But on the other hand there are tons of books to be read giving the game alot of lore. although its not as much as Morrowind.\",\n",

The puzzles accomplished in Grim Fandango may seem small but later on you realize that they have had an important impact on the plot of story. \\xa0\\xa0 One of the most frustrating parts of Grim Fandango is that hotspots in this game are signified by Manny's head movements. It works most of the time but it's frustrating when Manny is at a distance or when hotspots are close together.  Grim Fandango is one of the few adventures that left me with a terrible feeling of emptiness once it was completed.

       "  'description': \"Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is an outstanding game. The gameplay diverts itself from its WWII counterparts, and it turned out to be a great decision. There is practically nothing wrong with Call of Duty 4. Practically Nothing.  The core gameplay is about the same as the previous Call of Duties. The L1 button brings the gun up to your face so you can aim. But what separates this one from the others is the variety in gameplay. The guns are great and realistic and powerful. The single player campaign takes you through the Middle East as an American Soldier, through Russia as an SAS soldier, and through Chernobyl as a flashback 15 years in the past. There is one mission where you are in the seat of a bomber plane, and you get to shoot bombs at the little dots on the screen. It's really incredible to watch the little guys fly all over the screen. Also worth adding is the ability to shoot through plaster, wood, or other thin materials. This is really helpful both online and in multiplayer. Also, COD 4 uses the same health system as COD 2, as your health regenerates as long as you stay out of sight.  The AI in Call of Duty 4 is just incredible. Enemies come in vast numbers, and will use flanking techniques and will have squad tactics of their own. It is really top notch in gaming today.  The campaign is only about 6 or 7 hours, but the overall quality of it is through the roof. Not one moment is boring, as you will develop a camaraderie with your squad members, especially Gaz and Captain Price. The Story in COD 4 is actually really good, as opposed to other shooters. The world is on the verge of a nuclear war, and you and your 5 or 6 squad members will have to save the world on your own, it seems. There are themes of genocide and injustice, and those are really captured in the campaign.  The multiplayer of COD 4 is the best of any shooter. There are 16 maps right out of the box, all of which were probably seen at one point in the campaign. There are a ton of different game modes like the normal team deathmatch, as well as a one on one cage match against another player. There's sabotage, and domination, and many other great games to be played. What's cool is the ability to create a class. As you play and become better, you will unlock upgrades such as different attachments and camouflage for your weapons, as well as perks like explosives. Other perks include the ability to upgrade you bullet damage, as well as your own health, the ability to remain unseen on enemy radar, and much more. If you get a 3 kill streak, you will get a UAV recon, which allows you to spot enemies on your radar, 5 kill streak is an airstrike, and a 7 kill streak is helicopter support. Playing online will have the Blu Ray in your hard drive forever. You are always motivated to do well, but if you don't there is still no pressure because it is still so much fun. There's also challenges to do, such as getting 150 headshots with a weapon, or running 10 miles. These challenges will get you XP to rank up. Online is incredible fun in COD 4.  It may not get noted a lot, but COD 4 is one of the most photo realistic games ever made. The character models are incredible, the lighting and shadows are great, and the buildings and textures are some of the best on a console. It doesn't hurt that the frame rate is silky smooth.  There's nothing really else to say, this game is almost flawless. But it is still missing offline or online coop, and the campaign could have been longer. Other than that, there is not one, NOT ONE reason you shouldn't get the game. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is one of the best games ever made.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"I probably would have enjoyed Patapon more if it weren't a portable game and I weren't trying to squeeze in sessions on the subway or at my girlfriend's house while she's watching TV or in situations that I typically make use of my PSP. Being a rhythm-strategy game, Patapon requires your full attention for extended periods of time (some levels 10 minutes or longer) and it's not something you can play on the go with other distractions.But it sure makes a great first impression. Gameplay is lively, simple and fun. The developers totally understand how to start you off simply and then gradually pump up the complexity as you play farther and it honestly offers a decent challenge without becoming annoying.But over time, the game starts to wear thin more noticeably than others b/c the gameplay mechanic is so simple and it can become a bit of a grind. The same problem afflicted Puzzle Quest, an otherwise fantastic game with a repetitive core mechanic that, for me, just wears thin after a certain point.Patapon certainly deserves credit for charm, creativity and a great price-point for what you're getting. It's just a shame we don't have the option to play it on PS3 instead on-the-go with the PSP.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Resistance: Fall of Man is the standout Ps3 launch title. Of the somewhat disappointing group, it is by far the best. It doesn't just happen to be the best of the worst, but it also happens to be a completely enjoyable shooter, that will be remembered as one of Sony's flagship franchises from now on.  The story takes place in an alternate setting 1951, where WWII never happened, and instead, a mysterious force known as the Chimera ravages its way through Europe. In the ruins of England, US and British forces take a final stand to save humanity. You take the role of US Sgt. Nathan Hale, an untalkative hero, that is tough as nails. You will uncover secrets about how the Chimera came to be, as well as question your own humanity.  The story in Resistance has a great base, but is told very poorly. The in game cutscenes are rare, although they do a fairly good job of setting things up. The rest of the story is told through black and white slideshows which are narrated good, but are very boring. The pacing is pretty good, however, and it never really comes to a screeching halt. The missions that you have to do, really don't connect well with the story, and although they make sense, don't seem to have any important connection to the main story of the end of the world. Only the last 4 or 5 missions really pick up storywise, which is a little disappointing, but it's great to know that Resistance is a franchise, and the base is there. It just needs to be opened up for future titles.  The artistic presence is high in Resistance. The feel of a war torn abandoned urban setting is captured to the wire here, and it really shows in every corner of the environment. There's some pretty good detail in everything, especially the character models, even if many of them are the very same. The framerate remains at a solid 30, and never dips once, in the roughly 16 hour campaign, and the countless hours you can spend online. There's an odd foggy look to everything, that kind of lessens the visual experience, but still adds to the 1951 feel.  Resistance shines through gameplay. The campaign, which you can do with another player in coop, takes you through suburbs, frozen rivers, underground railways, and Chimeran control towers. The variety in the enemies is great, and each one has a different way of taking it down. There are 12 weapons, each with normal fire modes, and one secondary fire mode, which can be anything from a homing tag, to a shield, to a grenade launcher, and to a metallic bouncy ball turret. The weapons are designed by the guys who made Ratchet and Clank, so it's no surprise here.  The enemy AI is some of the best in any shooter. Enemies will throw grenades, take cover, and have marksman worth aiming. Resistance is a challenge, and will keep you entertained and occupied for a long time. Nathan will occasionally have one or two soldiers join him every now and then, although it's a real chore to have them around. If you don't cover them, they'll get killed in just a few seconds. It's a shame they don't do the same for you.  There are a few vehicle sections, which feel very similar to Call of Duty 3, or Halo. The controls are tight, and the models are sturdy, and great for splattering some alien all over your windshield.  You really need to play Resistance to fully understand just how great the game really is. There's things to blow up, dark places to explore, Chimera to kill, and humanity to save. It is really a definitive moment for shooters on the Ps3.  Resistance sounds great, even though the music is kept to a low. Whatever music there is, it's an epic orchestral score. The voice acting isn't half bad, and the weapons sound great. There are no sound bugs, and every little detail is recognized greatly.  As the first great game on the Ps3, Resistance is still holding its own among the best. It's 16 hour campaign, and its endless multiplayer will keep it in your disc drive for awhile. Resistance offers 40 player online matches without any hitches. It's a real feat for next gen gaming. Online is always chaotic and fun, if you can get the hang of it. Unfortunately, there are a lot of players with too much time on their hands, and keep the game from being any fun for anyone else. Become one of them, or be eaten.  Resistance although great overall, is a bit of a mixed bag. It isn't unique at all, and feels like it should be something very average. The truth is, the game is far above average, and it's very hard to place your finger on what makes it as good as it is. The only way to figure that out, is to play it.\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'dogsounds reviews: Call Of Duty 4',\n",
       "  'description': 'I have to say, although I loved Call Of Duty 2 and 3, I had my reservations about 4. Primarily because I love World War Two first-person shooters, and modern-day combat doesn\\'t really float my boat quite as much. But, given all the good words I heard about it, and the fuckton of awards it sucked in like a bulimic at a cake factory, I could put it off no longer. And I have to admit, I had started to get \"the itch\" - the little voice saying \"Go on, try it, you know you want to\". And as I saw it in a bargain bin at my local Gamestation, rather incredulously for £20 - I think someone screwed up there - I had to dive in. And you know what? I am so glad that I did. I\\'ll try to keep this as spoiler-free as I can, because it actually has a really good storyline, and I don\\'t want to spoil that if you haven\\'t played it yet. Call Of Duty 4 is set in the present day, and allows you to play as - as is the Call Of Duty tradition - multiple protagonists, including Sergeant \"Soap\" McTavish of the British 22nd Special Air Service Regiment, and USMC 1st Force Recon Sergeant Paul Jackson. The plot centres around a Russian ultranationalist, Imran Zakhaev, who has been collecting materials for nuclear warheads from the site of Chernobyl over the last 20 years, and now has what weaponry and rogue military force he needs to stage a bloody revolt against the incumbent Russian Government - whom he feels have prostituted the once great nation to the West, and that he should return Russia to its former glory. As part of his plan, he also enlists the help of his ally, Khaled Al-Asad, whom he encourages to stage a coup d\\'etat in the Middle East and execute President Yasir Al-Fulani on national television (to distract all attention away from the uprising in Russia).  These are Russians. But they are BAD Russians, not GOOD Russians (who are presumably all the Russians who are not actively engaged in shooting your ass off) However, the British and U.S Governments discover the plan, and act to stop any escalations. McTavish is sent to Russia with the S.A.S., and Jackson to the Middle East with a significantly larger force of Marines. The story follows both, and switches back and forth as it progresses. Now, it has to be said, to set any game in a modern time will be a headache - someone has to be the bad guy, and whoever you choose, someone is going to resent it. Whilst it is probably not ideal that half the \"opposing force\" is from the Middle East, to Infinity Ward\\'s credit at least they have tried to show that Al-Asad is anti-establishment, and also to prepared to kill his own people. And the same applies for the Russians - the military forces are \"rogue\" and not officially sanctioned. Thin, I know, but given current political tensions, it was always going to be a tough call. I think Infinity Ward have done a reasonably good job of getting around it. Although, I can\\'t deny that I did occasionally feel uncomfortable playing as Jackson, fighting in the Middle East. Sometimes I felt like I was playing a U.S. Military sanctioned piece of propaganda, but the story would keep coming in to break that bubble. Just. Anyway, the story, on its own merits, is cracking, and engaging, and almost has a Bond feel to it. And, unusually for a war story, it is also emotional - there were a number of times I felt sadness, and even a lump in my throat. And I am a manly man. Wow. The visuals within the game are, simply put, breathtaking in places. There is no doubt that this game, even though I say it about others, really is pushing the 360, and making it work for its money. And work it does, very well. The use of lighting and mapping creates a wonderfully immersive, living and breathing world. And testament to its absorbing reality, not once was I confronted with a schlumpy texture that pulled me out of the illusion. Sure, not every texture is high resolution, but the textures have been balanced exceptionally well, so that what needs to look good does, and what doesn\\'t need to look that good doesn\\'t, and you hardly mind or notice. The game uses an entrancing depth-of-field effect that is both understated and ultra-effective. Character models look great, both near and far, and lighting and atmospherics are mesmerising. From a cargo ship on a stormy tumultuous ocean to dust-blown Middle Eastern streets, everything just works  Visuals in the game are simply gorgeous, and suck you in, totally. Like a hoover, or some other sucking device. That sucks. Audio is also top-notch, with a fitting score that blends in and never becomes obtrusive. I didn\\'t feel compelled to turn the music off at all in-game, which I usually do. Voice acting is very high-quality and blends seamlessly, and weapons effects have the perfect kick and punch. Some audio cues are taken straight from previous Call Of Duty titles, such as the frag explosions and ricochet sounds, but that\\'s fine by me. Also, some voice actors who you may have some to know in Call Of Duty 2 make a return, as new characters. But that\\'s no different to Halo\\'s inimitable marines, and it works just fine. Although, amusingly, I am certain that one of the actors providing voices for the Middle-Eastern insurgents is one who provided a German NPC voice in Call Of Duty 3. Now THAT is talented :) Animation is what I can only describe as, pretty much, the best I have seen in a game so far. NPC\\'s animate realisitcally, thanks to a ridiculous amount of motion-capture, and transitions from state to state are pretty much seamless. If you hit an enemy, he will react accordingly in a mixture or realistic key-framed animation and rag-doll physics. However, if you hit him again, his animations will change to take account of the new bullet impact. That is just awesome.  Yes, dudes actually look this real. And they animate as good as they look. They\\'s got the looks AND the moves. Oorah! Cutscenes are provided, for the most part, while loading new levels, and are a joy to watch, a mixture of regular animation and hi-tech wire-frame overpasses mixed with informational pop-ups, and actually make you feel that perhaps you are part of the cutscene, or recalling information on the subject on-screen whilst you watch it. Gameplay is hard to fault. Movement and flow are very well designed, and play is a nice mixture of linear with a degree of variability as to how you get to your next checkpoint, giving the player a nice feeling of freedom and empowerment. Weapons handling is almost flawless, with the exception of the Russian rocket launcher, which, no matter how you aim it, will throw a dose of pointy death straight at the target up until about 100 metres, when the rocket will just basically veer upwards and piss off across the horizon altogether. I gave up using them, for the most part, and I couldn\\'t hit shit with it. That aside, gunplay and gameplay are thrilling, often tense, and the action is pretty much non-stop. There are no boss battles, and no ridiculous sweeps in the difficulty curve. I\\'m looking at YOU, BLACK. AI, for the most part, is very good, although your allies do have that habit of standing right where you are pointing your chosen delivery tube of pointy fast death. But then, we kind of expect that nowadays. Enemy AI is still from the \"stand out in the open and shoot\" side of the family, but is clever enough when near cover to use it, sort of, and to not appear quite so dumb.  Someone should tell these Marines that the Wendy\\'s they are storming towards en masse to feed their high-fat diet just isn\\'t there. None of that in Nonspecificistan, you know So all in all, we have a thoroughly engaging plot, moisture-inducing visuals, and kick-ass audio, all mixed with non-stop action and addictive gameplay. But many have criticised the length of the single-player campaign (which is all I am reviewing here, as multiplayer does not really interest me). Now, some have said five hours. On my play through, I would say about ten, but then I like to creep about and act all Navy-Seal and peek round corners, check all rooms, reconnoitre. But however you play, it is short, for a modern game. Now, see, if you like your multiplayer, that\\'s not so bad, as it could be argued that the single-player campaign is secondary to what many are saying is a great multiplayer package. But, there are lots of gamers like me who are more interested in the solo campaign and not so much in multiplayer. However, for gamers like me, the saving grace is that because the action is non-stop, then when you want to replay or pop in for a quick session, you can start just about anywhere. Unlike most titles, where you may replay two or three of your favourite levels (what I call \"Assault On The Control Room\" type levels), in Call Of Duty 4 almost every level is replayable. So you could kill a pleasant few hours replaying levels, earning achievements you missed, and so on. And don\\'t forget that if you ramp up the difficulty, boy will you lengthen your play time. To wrap up, here\\'s a few points of interest you might find interesting about the game. * Unlike many games, it has an actual cheat mode menu. Some are cheats, but most are fun enhancements, like playing in black and white, or making the screen image a negative. And one, which I shall leave for your discovery, is without a doubt the funniest thing I have ever seen in a videogame, ever, bar none. * The voice of Captain Price may be recognizeable to players in the UK - that of Billy Murray, who played D.S. Don Beech in ITV\\'s The Bill. Oh, and apparently, some bloke in Eastenders. But I have no idea, you\\'ll have to ask your girlfriends about that. Unless you know because they make you suffer it, in which case I have felt that pain. Anyway, it was quite jarring at first, and didn\\'t fit, but after a while, you think \"hey, I\\'m being ordered about by Don Beech, awesome!\" * The one thing that would have added even more awesomesauce to the game would have been the \"aim and lean\" mechanic from Medal Of Honor: Airborne. Many people underrate that mechanic, but I think it is an incredible tool - once you have used it to pop and stop, or poke around corners in Airborne, it seems hard to go back to playing a game where you have to move out into the open to get a shot at a bad guy. Just my two cents. * If you enjoyed BLACK on the original Xbox (or now on Xbox Originals) you will like this game. Many times when playing as \"Soap\" McTavish, I found myself walking through Russian woodland, humming themes from the BLACK soundtrack. If you strung levels from BLACK and Russian levels from Call Of Duty 4 together, they would probably fit quite well. One can only hope that the rumored next-gen (i.e. curent-gen) incarnation of BLACK turns out as good as this game. * It is vastly amusing that even Captain Price thinks that \"Soap\" McTavish is a ridiculous name, saying at the start \"Soap? What kind of a name is that?\". LOL. So yes, I love it. I am pleased that I spent the money on it (well, especially as it was maybe mis-labelled as too cheap - heh), but it is a game that I could thoroughly recommend you pay £39 for. Trust me. dogsounds\\' verdict - just fucking go and buy it. Even Zero Punctuation liked it. The shortness of the campaign takes it down to a 4 and a smidge stars out of 5.. Oorah! ',\n",

It's more of an appreciation in hindsight, as Halo has obviously been eclipsed by modern shooters like Call of Duty 4, Half-Life 2 and Crysis. Open-field battles, two-weapon fighting and regenerating shields were really popularized here first and still make a great impression.The game world borrows a lot from action sci-fi like Aliens, but manages to establish a dramatic mood with the fantastic score and fights that build up in momentum through levels. The game definitely plays up your ego as NPCs continuously make comments to you like you're a savior and battles often make you feel like you're coming to the rescue just in the nick of time.Unfortuantely I was only able to play about half the game before graphic problems kept me from progressing. Game freezes on a game this old are pretty ridiculous ... FEAR had the same problem with a certain point in the campaign just stopping you from progressing b/c the game would just lock up at a specific location.I got the game used for dirt cheap, so not a huge loss, but just a warning if you're paying full price for this -- maybe you'll be more patient and willing to try different graphic drivers to get past the problem.I enjoyed what I saw and basically got my fill of Halo.

       "  'description': \"I'm not a huge puzzle game fan, but I couldn't help but check out Puzzle Quest after seeing so much positive feedback last year. This is easily one of the best PSP games I've played and a consistently fun, addicting experience.The basic Bejeweled-style puzzle game takes on a great twist with you playing as one of four traditional RPG classes -- druid, mage, warrior or knight (paladin). Each class gets perks via stats and spells that encourage you to actually play the game in a style traditionally attached to those classes. As a knight, you'll be playing a defensive game of attrition. As a mage, it's all-out damage burst as fast as possible. The game fleshes out a surprising number of RPG conceits -- there's weapon and gear crafting, taming pets, learning spells from captives, forming parties with companions. This is by no means a one-trick pony. When you hear this game is a RPG/puzzle blend, that's the honest truth. This is a deep RPG statistical system that will remind more of World of Warcraft than anything else.Another commonality with WoW is that Puzzle Quest is insanely addictive while being easy to play in short bursts. Play one fight on the bus, on the subway, in bed before going to sleep -- there's always one more quick fight to play and new spells to unlock and stats to build on your character.There's even a storyline that won't make you squeamish. It's typical fantasy stuff -- defend this, escort that, fetch this, vanquish that -- but it never insults your intelligence or drifts into embarrassing cliches. Perfectly solid in the 20-some hours I've played so far.I feel like I'm just scratching the surface of Puzzle Quest, which is remarkable considering the brief scope of so many portable games. If you have even the slightest interest in RPGs, either the tactical power-gaming side or just for the atmosphere and storylines, you owe it to yourself to get hooked on Puzzle Quest.

       "  'description': 'Pros Fast, frantic fun. Easy to learn, driven by competitive leaderboards. The multiplayer, while not very original, is good fun with friends.  Cons Story mode is over in as little as 4 to 5 hours. Lack of a real narrative or story. The package as a whole is somewhat scarce.  Gameplay The Club has no story, so let\\'s get that out of the way. Now, this game plays like a racer and a shooter in one. You begin by choosing from a selection of 8 characters with varying statistics in 3 different categories. As far as tournament goes, you\\'ll have 8 different environments where you do 6 or 7 events each tournament. Make sense? Before I get into that let me detail a bit more on the concept. You run through the level based on the type of event. Either way, you run through at a consistently fast pace following arrows and guides, killing enemies, and trying to get your combo meter up to accumulate a larger amount of points. Keep up your speed, accuracy, and combo and you can see not only where you are \"racing\" but how that fits into the shooting aspect.  Now the aforementioned events can be a couple things. There\\'s simple ones where you just go through the level trying to reach the exit, whereas others have you staying alive for 2-4 minutes. On top of that, there\\'s one where it is much moreso like a race and you have to kill enemies to get time as well as hit stop watches, because if the time hits 0 you pretty much die. There are a couple more, but in the end they are just different variations that have you racing to the exit.  Multiplayer uses the same controls as single-player and strips away most of the racing concept. You are usually trying to kill the leader of the other team while protecting yours, or taking over the enemy territory, down to the basic kill matches. Now it is fun from what I played, but I had to have a friend accompany me. Why? No community, this game seemed to be released as pretty underrated, and while it had people playing in the beginning, all those people got bored of the mostly unoriginal MP and moved on.  Graphics/Sound The graphics are slick and bright. The character models are very nice, but the AI enemies are oftentimes the same one as the last. The environments, of which there are 8, is not enough to keep your mind pre-occupied. Let me be honest, you get tired of an environment when you have to play 6 events on it, even treading through the same parts from maybe a different event. Basically, a lot of things are recycled. The AI, on that topic, is equally terrible. Although I can\\'t judge it because this game does just want you to run and gun not worry about hiding enemies. The sound is your typical shooter.  Value  The Club went down fairly quickly as far as pricing goes. If you had the choice of renting or buying, I would say rent if you can get it in the $20 or below range. A rental will also work if you aren\\'t an extreme completionist. But for a game that has a 5 hour single-player campaign and no online community, it\\'s hard to recommend a dieing game.[This review was transferred from my profile on GameSpot.]',\n",

I had played some pokemon before that, but I had never been a serious gamer. Paper Mario as a series has captivated me with it's unique art style, humorous writing, and powerful gameplay. The Thousand Year Door is no different. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The story starts as Mario gets a letter from Princess Peach, who has found a treasure map and wants him to meet her at a distant town called RoguePort. Well, the Princess gets captured by some evil baddies, and Mario has to find seven crystal stars in order to save the world from an evil demon. The story isn't great, but it moves the game along and is bearable thanks to the series' great characters.One thing that Mario RPGs have done well is combat. Rather than having random encounters, the enemies appear on the overworld and it's up to you to either chase them down or avoid them. Once you are in combat, the game requires you to time out your hits in order to do the most damage. Mario can jump on or hammer enemies, but he also has his partners, an array of colorful characters of all backgrounds. These support characters have their own strange abilities and can make these battles frantic.What has always separated Paper Mario from the crowd has been the graphics. All the caharacters are in 2-d(Thus the Paper part) in a 3-d world. Paper Mario:TTYD expands on the paper element by allowing Mario to transform into a paper airplane, boat, or roll up into a tube. The soundtrack is solid, bringing the player deeper into the experience. The music travels perfectly with the emotion of the game, from spooky to intense to heartwarming.As for replayibility, I still pop this game in occasionally. It's a lot of fun that can suck you in. And with the fall of the gamecube, you could probably get a used version of the game to play on your Wii for $20. I suggest you buy it. This is, in my opinion, a true masterpiece.\",\n",

In the 90\\'s my interest in the genre was revitalized when I played MechWarrior II for the first time (and later enjoyed Neon Genesis [Shin Seki] Evangelion, and Gundam Wing). Pretty much, if it has big robots with even bigger guns I\\'m gonna be attracted to it and probably naturally like it to a degree.  Armored Core 4 is my first experience with the series so obviously I\\'m jumping on board pretty late here. But with Chromehounds leaving me wanting I was anxious to try out the \"Gundam\" route. After-all, it was the fast and agile Japanese types that I grew up with. And with it being several years since I had played the glorious dream that is MechWarrior I couldn\\'t wait to hop inside another Exo-skeleton and blow sh*t up.  I wasn\\'t all gun-ho however. I\\'d read the reviews. And I knew that the same company that was responsible for the uninspired story and gameplay of Chromehounds, was also behind AC4. Most unfortunately, my reservations were not unfounded. Anyone in a similar position as myself should not expect anything like MechWarrior - on any level.  GAMEPLAY Without question, AC4 take a little getting used to to control with any proficiency. And while the two pre-set configurations aren\\'t all bad, it doesn\\'t help that the developers made the preferred set-up the non-default one. I imagine they did this only because to use the second set-up effectively, you have to hold the controller a bit unorthodox; index fingers on the bumpers, middle fingers on the triggers. Once you get the right control set-up for yourself, controlling gets substantially better.  The Nexts (mechas) themselves handle well enough. They can be a bit erratic at times and they certainly require a soft touch to pilot well. A tad frustrating is that your Next will respond differently depending on the soft touch - all of it undocumented. i.e. it\\'s possible to do quick, 90 degree turns or transitioning between gliding across the ground and taking off to full flight.  The biggest gameplay issue has got to be the short missions. Honestly though, the length of them really didn\\'t bother me much. It\\'s nice to play a game for a change where you can sit down for 20 minutes and play through a few missions rather than get half-way through one. My gripe has more to do with your expected behavior and how missions are scored. AC4 is all about efficiency. Complete the objective as quickly as possible with as little ammo and taking as little damage. Which sounds right. That\\'s how wars are fought. War is costly. But blowing stuff up is so much more fun. So instead of being rewarded for destroying everything the enemy throws at you, you\\'ll be penalized for taking too long and using up your resources. It\\'s this mindset that makes the game ridiculously short. And yes, just about every mission will be completed in a couple minutes.  GRAPHICS & PERFORMANCE Visually, AC4 is nothing to write home about. The Nexts themselves are superbly detailed but you never really get to see them unless you view them in your hanger - in which they look badass. Why couldn\\'t the whole game look like that? Environments are sparse but acceptable. Personally I think they\\'re better than those in Chromehounds but barely. But there\\'s not much detail done in models or textures.  The framerate clips along pretty smoothly as well. When there\\'s a lot going on it might stumble a little but it\\'s not really noticeable. Where performance suffers is load times and the number of times things have to load. Jumping between screens or even pictures of Nexts will cause ridiculous load times. Starting missions are the worst and replaying a mission if you fail makes you start from the mission briefing so you get to enjoy all the loading again.  VALUE AC4 is oozing with potential, it\\'s heartbreaking that FROM didn\\'t capitalize on it. Games these days suffer so much from repetitive play and while you\\'re pretty much doing the same thing from mission to mission, there\\'s good variety in how those missions are carried out so you won\\'t ever feel like your replaying the last mission you just did. Most missions offer a unique challenge as well which only adds to the enjoyment of playing through each one.  In terms of difficulty, AC4 is a roller-coaster ride. I myself started out beating the missions fairly well but would get pwned on 1-on-1 matches against the CPU. Then I unlocked the uber-weapons. From there on out the game is ridiculously easy. For the \"A\" rating at least. Trying to complete both difficultly levels for high marks is unforgiving. You\\'ll cruise through the game on normal - even with S grades. But go to Hard and forget about it.  Also, because each mission is centered around one objective with no regard for enemy defenses, each mission will play out the same and will be fairly predictable the second time around.  Mech customization is a mixed bag. For the campaign you only need 2 or 3 variants of the same design. For player-vs.-player matches you\\'ll get a chance to play around a bit more and develop a mech that suits your style. While there are lots of options in terms of weapon choices and body parts (not to mention combinations of such) you won\\'t be creating any wildly experimental types and the customization process in terms of what you can actually build is fairly limited.  IN THE END AC4 could be so great. The story is a bit loose and not nearly as engaging as say, MechWarrior II, but it\\'s there and it works a lot better than Chromehounds. The missions may be short but they\\'re fun and with good variety. But ultimately, they prove to be too focused on the end-game, penalizing players for having fun. Complete the game for the parts, then build your dream mech and try to find a nice person on LIVE to play against to extend the value of this one.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Uncharted is a fantastic adventure game in its own right, blending platforming and action with strong characters and an interesting storyline. But it's also a refreshing change of pace from the dark brooding sci-fi / pseudo-sci-fi first-person shooters that's dominating the console action market the last few years.Environments are a blast to explore -- lush, detailed and filled with realistic lighting and water effects. But levels are far from open-ended. You'll never stray far from where you're supposed to go which help keeps the game focused but also serves as a constant reminder you're playing a platformer, not truly exploring the jungle.Uncharted also does a great job balancing action sequences with platforming and puzzles. It starts with simple ledge jumping and climbing, but gets into more abstract puzzles later in the game as you're negotating how to get through ruined, collapsing buildings and dungeons. Gunplay is decent, but aiming can be a pain with the PS3 controller and the endless stream of pirates can get a little repetitive. Fights can also take a while to complete b/c the AI is pretty decent at using cover and also takes a lot of damage to put down. Getting a burst of submachine gun fire apparently isn't enough to bring down these guys, so you'll be pumping lots of lead into these champs.Uncharted also deserves props for how well-written the dialogue is. Granted, some might find it too cheesy or similar to stuff you see on TV sitcoms, the fact that the dialogue generally feels like a real TV show or movie automatically puts it leaps and bounds beyond the stilted tripe you typically see in video games.Uncharted is easily recommendable to anyone with a PS3. While it's not perfect, it's a worthwhile adventure to dive into and one of the few $60 console games where you definitely get your money's worth.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Editor\\'s Note: I wrote this review a long time ago. I think it needs some polish. I still agree with everything I said, however the review itself isn\\'t that well written. I still think I bring out some good points though, so the review can still be helpful to those seeking advise.Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life is another game in the very popular Harvest Moon series. Though it might be shunned by those looking for a more violent game, those who give it a shot and enjoy running the farm will see why this series is so special. Unfortunately, after everyone sees this, both Harvest Moon veterans and newcomers alike, will start to notice flaws that hold this entry in the series back.In Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life, your goal is run a farm and raise a family successfully. Running the farm is pretty easy. Just take care of all of your animals, which include cattle, horses, sheep, chickens, and goats. Loving and caring for your animal is crucial, so you can get higher quality milk from your cows, better eggs from your chickens, and you need to clean your sheep\\'s wool, so it\\'s nice and clean, and good quality when you sheer it. If you don\\'t, your animals make lackluster products for you to sell and you make less money. You can also make crops if you want. Except, they\\'re not quite worth your time, because they require too much work and come off as little profit, so it\\'s just a feature to the game that feels tacked on. You can also raise a family in Harvest Moon. In the first year of the game you have a choice of 3 different girls, which whom you can marry. The year after that you and your wife have a son. Who you befriend in the village, decides what career your son will decide to take. Raising a family isn\\'t really crucial to the gameplay, but it is a nice addition that most people will enjoy.Well, what can we do after that? That leads to one of Harvest\\'s Moon\\'s main faults. There are some other things you can do after tending to the farm, but not really all that much. You can fish, you can go to the dig and search for fossils, and you can talk to the villagers, but that\\'s about it. Fishing and fossil digging is fun, but only for too long, and the villagers tend to say lots of the same things after a while, which makes the game really repetitive. Things only really change after the end of a chapter, but you\\'ll quickly realize that there\\'s hardly a difference to the gameplay.Harvest Moon is a beautiful looking game that is full of detail. The game has a somewhat childish look to it that fits in with the feel of the game perfectly. The game has excellent lighting effects; objects that should have shadows do and those go onto to characters underneath them, you can have a person that is half covered by a shadow and the other half being appropriately colored as well. It\\'s little details like this that suck you into the game, making you feel as though it\\'s the real thing.The audio in the game is nothing really spectacular. The music you\\'ll be hearing most of time is okay, and might be what most people call \"elevator music\", but it\\'s not too huge of a problem since most of time you\\'ll be sucked into the main gameplay. The sound effects are also decent. The animal sound effects are particularly good, and sound like the real thing. There does feel like there was a missed opportunity to include voice acting, but the audio is decent.Harvest Moon is a fun game, that a select group of people will enjoy. It has a distinct personality not commonly seen in more modern video games, and its beautiful graphics will suck players into this game leaving those who enjoy the game hopelessly addicted. A Wonderful Life is a good game, but the lack of goals and things to do keep it from meeting its full potential.',\n",

This game has been released for PC, Xbox 360 and PSP. All in the months before Christmas 2006. I will be reviewing the PC version. The game allows you to manage many different football clubs all around the world. You will have the power to buy and sell players. Set ut the team training and conjure a tactic for your team to follow in matches.You can play the game for as many hours as you will, it's a neverending game. Because your character will never grow too old. Therefore you can play as long as you have room on your harddrive. Sports Interactive have hundreds of volunteer scouts who scout their favorite teams and send them player stats, so the players on your game will be as accurate as possible. A few real football managers have admitted to using Football Manager 2007 as a scouting tool for new talent. To begin with the game has many bugs and problems, but patching has fixed all major problems with the game.  The interface of the game can be quite hard to get into if this is your first management game, but if you give it some time you will learn to love it. The game uses a regensystem. What this means that at the start of every season the game randomly creates new 17-year-old players so there will never be a shortage of players. This is by far the best football manager game out. \\xa0\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Every three to five years a video game comes out that just totally wins everyone over.\\xa0 Games that are universal in their appeal to everybody and if It not, is so perfect in its niche that it wins over those who don’t even like that style of game.\\xa0 Grand Theft Auto IV takes the gameplay of the legendary third installment (that was so famously released on the PlayStation 2) and makes leaps and bounds graphically and in terms of gameplay depth. But what really touches the user and creates this amazing gaming experience goes to those players who really invest their time in this game’s story mode.\\xa0 Niko Bellic (picture above) is such an amazing protagonist and feels like such a real person that you actually become conflicted with decisions that need to be made in the game.\\xa0 Twice there was a choice on who to kill, with each decision drastically changing the game’s storyline and your wallet.\\xa0 Both times I had to pause the game, and actually think or drive around one of the islands of Liberty City to just weight it over.\\xa0 That is why this game easily gets the easiest 10 out of 10 I have ever given and experienced.This review is just going to focus on the story (campaign) of the game.\\xa0 Tom will be writing a review in the hopefully not so distant future on the city and more in depth with the multiplayer/online modes. The story begins with possibly the coolest intro to a video game ever made.\\xa0 First off, it looks like a movie.\\xa0 Not in terms of graphics quality, but in terms of music choice and the creation of an atmosphere.\\xa0 The story begins with you, Niko Bellic, coming from his homeland (still unknown, best guesses are Bosnia or Serbia) and coming to Liberty (New York) City to live temporarily with his cousin Roman.\\xa0 At first you just assume he was going to visit to see how America was and to experience some reuniting with his cousin but after the first couple of encounters you begin to realize there is more to Niko’s trip. You also start to realize that Roman’s tales of gorgeous women, and his accounts of how great his life is in America, start to wash away and you see the true life Roman leads.\\xa0 Niko goes on the fast track of meeting the who’s who of Liberty City crime families.\\xa0 You start working for European gangsters, running some odd jobs for people who you begin to know through a ‘friend of a friend’.\\xa0 The creativity behind how you must complete these missions are amazing, at one point you have to post an ad on a gay matchmaker’s website to kill a gay dude who is ratting on the mob to the police.\\xa0 In another, you have to send an application to a law firm for an interview so that you can gain access to his building and assassinate him. As the game goes on and on you discover more and more about the history Niko.\\xa0 You learn disturbing events that occurred to Niko and Roman and the village that they lived in.\\xa0 You find out that Niko has a vendetta against a specific individual in his life and has an undying urge for revenge.\\xa0 But Niko is not just a silent hit man who takes orders to kill anyone and everyone.\\xa0 You get to make more decisions, in what can be compared to a ‘Choose your own fate’ style video game, it allows Niko to come off as very ‘human’. When it was all said and done, I had invested 28 hours into the main story line and the occasional side mission.\\xa0 94 missions never felt more like a novel or film, and the last 3 hours worth of story line was so addicting that I almost considered calling off of work to finish the game to see what the hell was going to happen.\\xa0 At the end, you have a choice of either killing someone or working with them.\\xa0 That choice ends up costing the life of one of two people, and let me tell you.\\xa0 If i had the option, I would have gone back and changed my choice. This story line is amazing and something that doesn’t need to be adapted into a movie, because this is a movie.\\xa0 This has the linear beginning to end, but at the same point doesn’t get monotonous or generic.\\xa0 You think you know where the game is going but it takes a turn and you’re left catching up.Right off the bat you get to experience the controls of the game.\\xa0 Most notably the new driving physics, which are great and realistic but incredibly frustrating.\\xa0 If it starts to rain just park and wait for it to pass over.\\xa0 After awhile you acquire a cell phone which becomes your life line in the game.\\xa0 You use the phone to call for cabs, call for jobs or races, learn of when an employer wants you to do something, or even take pix messages.\\xa0 The newest combat feature though would be the cover system.\\xa0 Its a so called bare bones ‘Gears of War’ -esque, where u can cling to a wall and peer around the corner.\\xa0 It enables you so just don’t run into a room and get shot up like crazy. The usual culprits of cars are there, you still have your no name cars that completely resemble real life cars.\\xa0 Your Porsche, Mustang (Banshee), they all still exist.\\xa0 There are still boats but there is no plane in this version, however they do have helicopters (which is an extremely fun time).\\xa0 The new interaction that was incorporated into the game was dating.\\xa0 Through the game you meet more and more women, and you met them online and depending on where you take them, your odds of being ‘invited inside’ grows. The GPS device definately helps you go from mission to mission and helps you navigate through a surprisingly complex series of streets, bridges, and alley ways.\\xa0 The new ’star’ system shows you a set circle of where you need to go to get out of the the police’s radar.\\xa0 You see a flashing blue and red circle and once you drive out of that area and chill the police get lost.\\xa0 When there is one or two stars its pretty easy.\\xa0 But the difficulty curve jumps rather high when you get to 3+ stars.Pros:The greatest story I’ve experienced in a game that I’ve ever playedThe deepest city I’ve seen, not the biggest but the most ‘full’Niko is an awesome character, but there are at least 3-5 other characters who are either hysterical or you hate them, but either way they suck you into the storyThe graphics are not the best in the industry, but the city looks perfectRadio stations are better then everI became connected to Niko and wanted to do more and more and without even worrying about moneyPerfect amount of achievements that are really hard and really easy and more put towards progression of the game and not just ‘gimmicky’Cons:Occasionally the frame rate drops off and it gets alittle blurryThe problems with PS3 versions (and some X box) causes freezing and is really lame for a game that cost 100 million to produce.Made me not have a life for approximately 10 daysbizzlebros.wordpress.com',\n",

       "  'description': 'This has been a long time coming, but I\\'ve finally managed to get a review out on the highly anticipated debut of Ratchet and Clank on next gen consoles. Like every Ratchet and Clank game, it\\'s blow up first, and platforming second. Luckily, the guys at Insomniac down right perfected both kinds of gameplay, and the result is one of the best Ps3 exclusives to date.  This time around, the universe is being overtaken by Emperor Tachyon, a little evil dude sworn to destroy every last Lombax alive. This takes Ratchet and Clank across the universe, trying to save it piece by piece, while trying to keep their own duo together. Ratchet is trying to figure out the Lombax secret, while Clank is possibly going crazy, because he can see these invisible robots called the Zoni, that can uber-pwn anything in their path. There are a few slight twists and turns in the story, and with some witty writing, as always, Tools of Destruction has an overall decent story, that is worth paying attention to.  As I said earlier, Ratchet and Clank Future one of the best Ps3 exclusives. This is due to many reasons, but it\\'s the gameplay that separates it from games like Uncharted and Heavenly Sword. The game is called \"Tools of Destruction\" for a reason. That reason is that you will be at the helm of dozens of weapons, all capable of blowing the hell out of anything. There\\'s a large variety to the weapons. There\\'s the combuster, which shoots fireballs, there\\'s the shard reaper, that reaps shards. There\\'s an alpha cannon that obliterates anything, pretty much, there\\'s fusion bombs, an electric whip, and the list just goes on. Each weapon is clearly capable of kicking ass. Some just do it better than others.  Adding some depth to the already deep arsenal of weapons, is the upgrade system. As you progress through the game, you pick up hundreds of thousands of these bolts, which are the fruit of the battle, so it\\'s worth it to pick up as many as possible. These bolts can be used to purchase ammo and new weapons, which is the only way to get new weapons, so it\\'s really important. Also, there\\'s raritanium, which are dropped by some of the tougher baddies. This is used to upgrade your weapons. The upgrade screen is simple to use, as everything is in a honeycomb type of setup. Attributes for your weapons are inside the honeycombs, and your can purchase better attributes for your weapons, such as more ammo capacity, and more damage. This is extremely helpful in completing the game.  Also, the more you use your weapons, naturally,they get more powerful on their own. So, if your can fully upgrade your weapon using raritanium, and using your weapon a lot, then the name of your weapon will change, and it will be the ultimate.  Ratchet and Clank is one of the best looking games out there. The immense amount of detail is great, and everything looks like it is a CG cutscene. Adding to that, artistically, this game is a real pallet. The amount of color on the screen, and the shine and lighting effects, and the enemy models, not to mention the non enemy character models are fantastic. Explosions(which there are a lot of) look amazing. Everything runs at a blistering 60 frames, without one drop, in the entire game. Not one. And finally, if you haven\\'t noticed from screenshots, the game looks like a Pixar movie. No joke. This game looks fantastic. There are no issues with physics, as gravity is in full effect, and there are no clipping issues. Everything behaves realistically. Hell, you just need to see this game in motion in your living room, and the only way to do that is to play it.  The soundtrack is okay, and it sets the tone well. But, the series is known for its witty writing. Tools of Destruction doesn\\'t disappoint there. Every line is hit perfectly, and it really adds to the entertainment. It\\'s what makes the already great story even better to watch unfold. If you play through this whole game, and don\\'t even smile once, you are a robot, with no sense of humor whatsoever. There\\'s nothing that will really blow you away, but there\\'s nothing to keep you from turning the volume up. In surround, this could be a real aural masterpiece.  As perfect as this game is, it isn\\'t without its issues. For starters, there are way too many things to do in this game. There are dance minigames, which you must do 5 or 6 times, there are rails, which undoubtedly are fun, but nonetheless odd. There are awkward SIXAXIS minigames. Variety is great, but this game kind of pushes the limits. There\\'s no naggin issues with this, it\\'s just that it can get a little annoying.  Remember that huge arsenal of weapons? Yeah, that kind of makes the game a little too easy. It doesn\\'t take away from any of the fun, it just kind of takes away from the challenge. At least the bosses are a little difficult, especially the last one. Insomniac has a way of balancing things out.  And my last complaint is the fact that you have to take control of Clank on a few occasions. These are just annoying, but make you really appreciate your time as Ratchet. And these sections are essential for the story, so you should pay attention anyways.  No more flaws.  This game takes about 12 hours to beat, and once you beat it, you can do challenge mode, which allows you to go back through the game, with every weapon you have. The difficulty is upped, and it makes up for the first time around. There are also a bunch of achievements necessary for unlocking cheats and extras, sort of like in Uncharted. Also, the game is flat out fun, so you should play through at least twice.  Insomniac has done it again. Ratchet and Clank Future Tools of Destruction is amazing.',\n",

The flickit system is fresh, innovative, smooth, and natural. It is the most perfect control scheme possibly ever in the history of gaming. No joke.  San Vanelona is the featured city in skate., and it\\'s full of sweet rails, and steep streets for you to get cool lines off of. Of course, there are also plenty of cars and pedestrians to get in your way, but it just adds to the organic feel of the world. Instead of grinding on a telephone wire, you\\'ll be grinding on a curb, or on a handrail. San Vanelona is wide open, with four different subsections. The Suburbs is where you\\'ll find the community center skate park, as well as plenty of backyard pools to get your air on. The Rez is full of steep streets, with lots of jumps. Here\\'s where speed freaks will get their own. Downtown is the financial district, with 30 stair rails, but also lost of security to try to stop you. Finally, Old Town is where you\\'ll find all the skate plazas, as well as the dry dam, where all the best races are held. The city is huge, and whatever your style, you\\'ll find something to fit you.  Graphically, skate. is a gorgeous game. The lighting effects are fantastic, and the animations made by your skater are seemless. Unfortunately, there are a few drops in framerate, and many of the textures are blurry. You\\'d think that\\'d make the game hideous, but it really doesn\\'t. skate. has a great art style that keeps everything looking great.  skate. isn\\'t just a street skater, as there are plenty of places to get sweet air. The triggers allow you to grab wither side of the board, and the right analog stick tweaks your grab in air. Pressing the brake button can take your feet off the board, so you can do a christ air, or a no foot air. The vert system is really deep, and just as feash as the flickit system.  Jumping and grinding are really innovative and simplified. Flicking the right stick down then up allows you to ollie, and simply jumping on a rail at a good angle will allow you to grind. It\\'s much more simple and realized than pressing a button when prompted.  As you can tell, I love the trick system. Surrounding that, there are a ton of game modes to use it in. Career mode allows you to create your own skater, and try to become famous. Throughout San Vanelona, you need to get coverage in the Skateboard Mag, or Thrasher Magazine. Once you\\'ve obtained the cover to each magazine, you get to go to the X Games. There are tournaments to win, and cool spots to own, as well as pros to show up. All the challenges are very difficult,but very rewarding to do. if you never give up, you will love career mode. The X Games are announced by Sal Massakela. This is the best use of an ESPN license in the history of gaming. No Joke. There\\'s also the big air ramp at the X Games, which is really cool, and you\\'ll get a ton of air here. If you get gold at the X Games, that\\'s about as rewarding the game will get. It will take about 3 - 6 hours to do that, but you can still go out an unlock all the skaters and places to skate.  There\\'s a good online mode, with races and spot challenges to do, as well as playing a game of S.K.A.T.E. against others. You can also do this offline in \"Party Mode\" There\\'s a lot of ways to utilize the controls in skate., and it is unbelievably fun to do.  The soundtrack in skate. is one of the better ones by EA. There are over a dozen pros you meet through the game, and they are all voiced perfectly. skate. is such an authentic game that way. The actual sounds of skating are top notch, and were nailed 100%.  skate. has very little flaws. The framerate isn\\'t perfect, the camera is sometimes a bit clunky, and the game can be unfairly difficult. But those are the only flaws. There you go.  As for difference between both versions: The 360 version runs quite a bit smoother, and has better coloring, but the Ps3 version is sharper. It really just comes down to which console you have, and if you have both, then just flip a coin.  skate. is the best skateboarding game ever made. There isn\\'t enough good to say about this game. It really surprised me, as my expectations were skeptical going into playing. Once I played for awhile, i got sucked in. skate. is the most fresh and innovative idea in a long time. Not only is it a great skating game, it also happens to be one of the best games of 2007, in my opinion. Congratulations EA Black Box, you\\'ve won my confidence all over again.',\n",

Bomberman '93 is this game, it's addictive, easy to pick up and well worth the 800 points I spent on it.I can't recommend this game enough, if you weren't about for bomberman the first time get this buy it, get four of your friends over for the evening (yes, you can have 5 player games) and have some fun.(I'm half supprised this game hasn't been banned yet as we keep getting told kids play video games and want to act them out in real life.

       "  'description': \"Warhawk is sexified. Flying through the skies, which look phenomenal, in planes that are kick ass, doing all sorts of maneuvers, while chasing another kick ass plane, and trying to shoot it down, is sexified. Unfortunately, the ground combat keeps Warhawk from being perfect, and it honestly almost ruins the game.  Developer Incognito was so confident with their multiplayer, that they completely scrapped the single player campaign, which is a shame, because it really subtracts from the overall value of the game. So, if you don't have an internet connection, then you should stop reading now, because you 100% should not get the game, as sexified as it is.  There are 4 game modes in Warhawk: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, and Zones. The first three explain themselves, but the latter needs some explaining. There are zones or bases, all over the map, and your team needs to control them. That's about it. All four game modes work well, even if the ground combat dampens the experience.  The flight part of Warhawk is what makes it so sexified, a word I will use over and over when I talk about it. The planes can be flown with the SIXAXIS, which actually does work well, or the left analog stick, for when you're feeling lazy. There are powerups in the skies, which are weapon pick ups. There are lock on missiles, TOW missiles, air bombs, and other kick ass weapons available to your arsenal. When you are locked on, you can use a chaff, to get rid of oncoming missiles, or you can swing around a hill to put things in the missiles' paths, just like in Super Mario Galaxy. You can go upside down, do barrel rolls, and all the other airshow stuff, without any seems, and that's sexified. If you can master the flight in Warhawk, you'll have a blast.  Now, the ground combat, which actually doesn't pan out as well as you'd think. The maps, first of all, are sometimes too big for you to travel across on foot. There are vehicles, such as jeeps with turrets, and tanks, which are unstoppable. Tanks are the best part of ground combat. However, there is a heavy unbalance between people in tanks, people in planes, people in jeeps, and people on foot. This unbalance makes Warhawk too difficult, which is unfortunate.  The sexified flight mechanic saves the day, as you can go to Dogfight servers, which are plane-only. Hells yeah.  Overall, Warhawk is sexified. Unfortunately, the lack of a single player campaign, uneven gameplay, and lack of a tutorial keep this one from being a must buy. If you love flight games, you should definitely give Warhawk a shot. It opens up for a lot of new things, and hopefully, upcoming expansion packs will make the game even better. As it stands now, Warhawk is a very good game, and that should be enough for at least a rent.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'This review is for the DEMO of Turning Point: Fall Of Liberty\\xa0 available on Xbox Live and was written January 2008.So, I have just played the demo for Turning Point: Fall of Liberty. Another WWII-era FPS (which is fine, I love \\'em), but this time with a twist. The game has a fantastic premise: Winston Churchill is hit by a taxi in New York before the outbreak of war, and before he took the office of Prime Minister (true) and dies (not true, and this is where things get interesting). The story lies in the fact that without Churchill to bolster and rally the British people during the years of World War two, there is little \"allied\" resistance to the Axis regime, and this excercise in speculation posits that the defiant little island would have been defeated and enslaved into the Nazi war machine. Then, as the 1940\\'s come to a close and the 1950\\'s arrive, the Reich sets its sights on the next prize: mainland America.  Coming to America - in this case, a whole fuckton of Nazis. Time to drink three pints and find a towel, I guess. The team at Codemasters have explained how they went to great pains to flesh out this brilliant \"what if\" idea, that if successful, would create a fresh, new entry into what many see as a tired genre. They researched weapons and technologies that were on the drawing board at the time the Third Reich fell in 1945, and tried to imagine what would have been if Germany had not been defeated and had continued on in its domination. That sounds like a lot of effort. So it is a pity then that this demo has just wiped out all that hard work and put me in a position where I wouldn\\'t even want to rent it. This is why the review is only for the demo. You play...um...I have no idea. Some construction dude who works out, it seems, and hangs around the low-res parts of town. Now, this is going to be hard, because in so many ways this is Hour Of Vicotry all over again. However, whereas Hour Of Victory was nothing more than standard fare at very best in terms of plot and design - nothing more than an open-topped tunnel crawler with the worst implementation ever seen - Fall Of Liberty: Turning Point has, at it\\'s heart, a cracking idea, and one mitigating circumstance, which I will come to. So, what\\'s it like? Well, first of all, visually, it is dull, simple, unattractive and almost not \"current-gen\" at all. textures are schmooshy and indistinct, effects are limited and pyrotechnics are...well, just terrible and reminiscent of 2-D bitmap animations. Lots of brown, gray, and...well, the occasional bright yellows are to be seen. I was shocked to see a burning building giving off said 2-D flames and what appeared to be two-foot diameter orbs glowing in green and blue. Go figure. Imagine Medal Of Honor: European Assault with something it didn\\' have - decent last-gen Xbox graphics, and you pretty much have Turning Point. Now, whereas in Hour Of Victory this was appalling, here there is one tiny mitigating circumstance: when you start to play (which is is like, \"la...la...la...BAM!\") you look down and see a WHOLE DAMN FREAKING CITY below you. That is impressive, and I have to give Codemasters credit for that. It is no doubt because of this that the texture and lighting quality has taken a hit. Still...I would much rather have a nice-looking game than a crappy-looking game in an enormous world I can explore 5% of.  Although the graphics are clunky at best, and shameful at worst, at least they are rendering a whole city. Hour Of Victory had no such excuses. Nothing looks real. Nothing has bumpmapping or any solidity, as far as I could tell. Cityscape draining the graphics budget aside, it is just poor. Then there is the animation. It\\'s probably in there somewhere, so if anyone does find it, please call Codemasters on 1-800 ZOMG and let them know to come and collect it. Nazi parachutists drop from the skies on what appear to be solid plastic parachutes, and they hang there utterly stiff and lifeless, unless you shoot them, in which case they make a clunky transition from \"hangng lifeless with legs up \" to \"hanging lifeless with legs and arms down and maybe no helmet any more\". I shot four in succession, and they all animated in exactly the same way. Immersive, not. Troops on the ground do no better. They seem to spawn crouched behind cover (key frame one), then stand up and move utterly out of cover to shoot you (key frame two), and then when shot they stand up straight, fling off their helmet like a vaccuous model throwing her hair about for a shampoo advert (key frame three) and then drop to their knees (key frame four). Every single time the same way. Sound is lifeless, dull and off the shelf. Through the entire first half was a sound that I can only assume is supposed to be the sound of the engines from the huge zeppelins flying over your head (which are impressive), but which in fact just sounds like very loud, very annoying cyclical mains hum. Weapons sounds are not interesting - and the \"futurised\" Gewehr 43 has a sound that, unbelievably, cuts off before it has finished. Oh, and each gun seems to have one single audio file, so don\\'t expect any Halo 3 style ability to figure out where the bad guys are and how far away by the sound of their weapons. Or, for that matter, any realism. And lastly, what of the controls? Just. Fun. Removing. Fucking. Awful. Throughout the whole demo (which is about 5 minutes) you have this sensation that time has somehow slowed, that you are running through treacle, and this applies to animations within the word also - NPC movement, debris falling, buildings collapsing. It is all just SLOW. And the same applies to the control scheme. On normal setting, it will take you half an hour to turn a full 360 degrees. Combat is a case of \"I hope the enemy dude doesn\\'t shoot me too much while I spend twenty minutes lining up a shot with this thirty-five foot long rifle.\" Which makes the enemy lack of motion, I suppose, a good thing. So you turn up the sensitivity to high, and whoa, fuck me Jesus, it is utterly unplayable. The slightest touch of the stick will send your weapon whizzing all over the screen. I tried running around a corner, turning at the same time, as I usually do to round a corner properly, and I ended going back the way I came. Which didn\\'t help when combined with the fact that several times it was not clear where I was supposed to go. When I finally figured that out, I couldn\\'t keep control of my guy to make him go that way.  This is actually an animated gif of me spinning around on the spot. Don\\'t adjust your sets. It\\'s just showing gameplay with the control sensitivity set to normal and playing in realitime speed. For the hard of thinking, that was sarcasm.\\xa0So, nasty visuals, terrible off-the-shelf sounds, cringeworthy animation and controls that can be set to \"tree sloth\" or \"motion sickness express\" and nowhere inbetween. Is there anything positive I can say here? Well, yes, again, it\\'s the idea. I would have loved for this demo to be good. I would have loved if it had been as playable as Medal Of Honor: Airborne or Call Of Duty 3, and I would have loved if it had looked as good as Call of Duty 4, Halo 3 or Bioshock (which is the nearest thing to compare it to visually, in terms of style, but boy, they are in different leagues). Why? because of the idea. Such a great idea. And such a waste. And this is why a feel a little bad ribbing on the demo, because whereas Midway just seem to have churned out Hour Of Victory, I can\\'t help shake the sense that the guys at Codemasters had a real vision for this game, and for whatever reason, it just never came together. When you see games like the ones I mentioned above, especially those set in WWII, it makes games like Hour Of Victory and, sadly, Turning Point: Fall Of Liberty all the more feeble, lifeless, lame and inexcusable. And definitely not worth £45. And, unlike Hour of Victory, which felt like nothing more than corporate shill and whip-cracking from above, it makes me feel guilty to be so negative about the game I have just played. These guys all doubtless work hard, and have families and bills to pay. But I suspect - sorry guys - that this game is not going to go very far to pay those bills. Sadly, with release set for February 29, I don\\'t see that there is really any chance for the game to be much different from this awful demo. Which sucks, because there is a dire need for games with innovative settings and stories. A need that this game would have filled, had it been on anybody\\'s wish list. Which, I suspect is no longer the case. dogsounds verdict: half a star at best - not even really worth renting, it would seem, and no fun at all - I\\'d rather eat my own hair.',\n",

       "  'description': \"\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The First-Person Shooter genre is quite an interesting topic of conversation. Ask around, and you’ll find many people who feel that the genre is full of games that are cut from the same cloth as one another. How many times can we be the space marine in another futuristic sci-fi setting, taking on an alien legion who threatens to destroy the planet? Even though games that follow that mold can clearly be successful, it’s nice to finally find a game that can be the square-pegged example of a different take on the dormant genre. The Darkness is the latest game from the folks at Starbreeze, and is a game based off of the comic from Top Cow. While the story and setting of The Darkness may not have been created from the minds of Starbreeze, the gritty world depicted in this hit comic is fully and successfully realized, and proves to be one of the better FPS experiences of this generation.     \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Players take on the role of Jackie Estacado, a young mobster who turns 21 during the timeline of the game. On the night of his birthday, Jackie gets screwed by his uncle, Paulie Franchetti, and is attacked by all of Uncle Paulie’s men. Paulie Franchetti is a ruthless and relentless crime lord, and sees Jackie as a threat to his mob empire. The story in The Darkness is very much a mob story, and that alone could steer even the most open-minded person away from the premise of this game. The story, however, is a wonderfully crafted and engaging one. Jackie’s problems run far deeper than having a power hungry tyrant of an uncle breathing down his neck. As he fights off these hordes of mobster lackeys to get back at his uncle, he begins to hear a twisted voice in his head, telling him to embrace the darkness, and urging him to keep killing and murdering. Jackie inexplicably acquires the power of “The Darkness,” a strange presence that manifests itself into the mind and body of Jackie, which gives him tentacle-like appendages that can attack and aid their host. Jackie’s fight clearly gets a lot more interesting because of these events, and he finds himself on a quest to kill a killer, and more importantly, protect the people he loves.     \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The fact that this review focuses so much on the storyline and narrative of The Darkness says a lot about the kind of game this is. As with The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay, Starbreeze always places a huge priority on nailing the storyline and characters. The plot always moves along at a consistent basis, and manages to keep players interested all the way through. One of the more inventive ways Starbreeze keeps the pace of the story going is by having a monologue from Jackie Estacado during every loading screen. It kills two birds with one stone, in that you’re not pulled out of the experience by watching a loading bar, and you’re getting a minute-by-minute update about however Jackie is feeling about your current situation. As alluded to before, the whole idea of embarking on a dark mob story could have backfired greatly, since many of us would assume a game with this setting would be a little to ‘badda-boom, badda-bing.’ Thankfully, that’s never the case; thanks in part to the incredible set of characters in the game. Each have their own distinct personalities, and feel like real people you’d encounter in real life; personality issues and all. These phenomenal characters are match with equally incredible voice acting. Each and every single major and minor character in the game sound just as you would imagine them, each with that sore-thumb  accent, but as stated before, tasteful and distinct. The dialogue and writing in general are wonderfully crafted. Nothing sounds corny or out of sync with the mood of the story -- it’s a very smart writing, with just enough wit and slightly sick humor included. It’s by far one of the best story-driven games in recent memory, complete with awesome plot moments that will leave you very satisfied.    \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The Darkness matches an excellent story and characters with a near perfect atmosphere. Being that The Darkness is set in New York, the game captures the look and feel of a gritty city very well. The subway stations you’ll traverse through are just as old and worn down looking as they’d look in real life. Tiles on the walls are stained and dirty looking, old newspapers and poster ads take up residence on the graffiti laden walls. You can hear the sound of funky dance music in the distance, and upon examining where that sound is coming from, you’ll find a group of four break dancers having a good time. You can even tip them if you wish. In another station, you’ll find a man playing a harmonica amidst the small hustle and bustle of people in each station. There are even televisions scattered throughout the locations you’ll travel. This time, it’s not just a slideshow of images like the last generation of games. It’s full music videos, television shows, cartoons and full length movies -- even more so with the PS3 version, thanks to the extra Blu-ray space. It’s such a powerful sense of atmosphere. Exploring the city streets isn’t quite as engrossing, since there’s a lack of cars traveling around, with hardly anyone walking around. However, it still manages to uphold that engrossing feeling of actually being there. The Darkness will pull you into it’s world in ways that you wouldn’t have assumed you’d be.     \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 On the gameplay end of the spectrum, this is still a FPS at heart. However, it’s very clear that Starbreeze has a very different take on handling a FPS game. The focus on story and setting is one thing, but actual gameplay is a whole other case. Many of the simplest things, like player movement, sensitivity and aiming are all handled very differently with Starbreeze. One of the first things players will notice about the gameplay is that it may feel too slow, or sloppy moving. That is a deliberate design choice by Starbreeze to simulate running in a more realistic manner. You won’t be shooting through every room like Quake. Of course, you can tinker with sensitivity options a little, but it won’t get The Darkness to play like our beloved Halo. That’s where this game will lose some people. Aiming is another big difference. The Darkness (by default) relies quite heavily on the use of auto-aim. This is seen by many as being a cheap gameplay dynamic, and those people can breathe easier because it is a changeable option. However, it does have it’s advantages. For example, say you’d like to shoot out a light above you. Most games make you look up and line your target reticule exactly on the light to shoot it out. The Darkness does things a smidge differently. When you look up and start to try and line up the reticule to the light, the game will recognize that you’re wanting to shoot that light off, and the reticule will move over to that light source, and all you have to do is pull the trigger. Your camera perspective doesn’t move; only the red reticule does. This also helps with dual pistols, since you would be able to target two different enemies at once, or maybe an enemy and a light source. It’s a very helpful feature, but it does take time getting used to. Instead of having melee attacks in the game, Starbreeze decided to do something much cooler. Now, when you get really close to an enemy and fire your weapon, you’ll do a stylized kill move. It’s all randomized, and it also depends on your weapon and where you are facing the enemy from. Jackie will do everything from shooting someone in the heart and in the face, to firing his gun right in the mouth of your soon-to-be-dead foe. Don’t forget, Jackie Estacado is no angel himself.     \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You may have wondered why there’s all this talk about shooting out lights. Well, this is where the x-factor of The Darkness comes into play. We’re talking about the powers Jackie gets from The Darkness itself. Once you’ve obtained these powers, you’ll have these aforementioned tentacle-like creatures; one at each side. Throughout the game, you’ll gain a handful of powers that will give you an advantage over your mobster enemies. Creeping Dark is an ability where you can send one of your tentacle creatures ahead of you to scout an area ahead, climb up and bite out a light source or perform stealth kills where you can eat the faces off of an enemy. Demon Arm is a power that allows you to strike an enemy straight through the chest with a sharp tentacle. It’s also possible to pick up objects, such as cars or other objects and throw them at waves of enemies. The Black Hole power allows you to cast a swirling black hole in front of you, which sweeps up every nearby enemy and inanimate object in that area. You then can trigger the black hole to explode, which sends all of the things caught in the black hole to be thrown wildly. Hello ragdoll physics. The last demon power are the Darkness Guns, which are a demonically enhanced set of dual pistol-like weapons. The left gun shoots lighting rounds in pistol fashion, and the left gun shoots thunder blasts, shotgun style. They are way more powerful than conventional weapons, and don’t have an ammo limit. Instead, they rely upon darkness energy. Remember shooting out those lights? Well, your darkness energy will deplete when you have your tentacles out (which can be toggled on and off) when you’re in intense light. Shooting out lights and staying in dim areas will regain darkness energy. You can also regain darkness energy, and increase the power level of your darkness powers, by devouring the hearts of dead enemies. You can watch in glee as both of your tentacle creatures pull out the heart of a fallen enemy and shred it into two pieces, and chomp away.      \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 These darkness powers work very well within the gameplay, and allow for a bit more fun in deciding how you want to kill off the legions of enemies you’ll be facing. Having these powers may sound a little overwhelming at first, but they’re introduced at a good pace. It’s a shame that you can’t start another game with these powers right off the bat, but then again, it’s understandable. While these darkness powers prove to be neat and useful, there’s another power that isn’t so useful -- Darklings. You can call upon these little creatures from little holes scattered throughout most areas, when you have the darkness powers toggled on. You can choose from a Berserker, a creature will run up and attack the nearest enemy around. Gunners are creatures that carry chain guns and fire relentlessly at your enemies. Kamikaze’s are creatures with a bomb placed on their backs, who run up to an enemy and suicide bomb them. \\xa0 Lastly, Lightkillers will short out any light sources in your way. It sounds pretty cool, but it is pretty flawed system. Unless you have shot out a large enough number of lights for these guys to do their thing, they’ll just burn in the light and die off instantly. That makes it hard for the Berserkers and Kamikaze’s to get to their target in time, and if an enemy happens to shoot at the Kamikaze, forget it. He’s exploding. Gunners almost always seemed to shoot at walls, and barely locked onto an enemy; more often than not. Lightkillers proved to be the most reliable Darkling to use, but even then, there were times when there would be a light source right in his location, and he’d leave it untouched. While it was nice to give players added battle options along with the darkness powers, it proved to be too unreliable, and often times useless to bother with. There were only a handful of times when the Darklings were legitimately needed for the sake of manpower. To their credit, they are a funny bunch of creatures. Some of their actions and one-liners are hilarious, and nothing is a bigger slap in the face than having a Darkling lift a leg and 'draining lizard' all over a fool. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  The full experience that The Darkness brings is an excellent one, however, it’s not a very long one. For those who need 20+ hour long games to justify a purchase, you’ll find yourself disappointed at the 8-10 hour long quest The Darkness presents to you. While there is a multiplayer mode included, it’s so much of an afterthought by the developers that it’s not even worth mentioning. It’s poorly done. Despite that, the single player experience is never dull, and you’re never at one place for way too long, but for most, it’s still too little. The Darkness also has a healthy amount of side quests to take part in, and you can jot down phone numbers you see on posters, billboards and signs and dial those numbers on the payphones in the Subway station for some seriously laugh out loud messages, and of course, unlockable content. Nifty unlockables in this game include unused cutscenes, character art and renders, and the coolest of them all, actual comics. Flipping through some classic comics of The Darkness, as well as other comic series’ from Top Cow is the ultimate novelty here, especially if the story of The Darkness leaves you interested for more, and it probably will. The Darkness breaks away from many of the conventions of the FPS genre. You may not like it when you play it, and it’s gameplay is certainly not for everyone. It feels very different. While that might steer people away, it’s also the absolute best quality about this game. It places priorities in a very different order than most FPS titles out there, and Starbreeze should be commended for sticking with their vision of how a FPS should play and feel. And hey, they got Mike Patton from Faith No More to do the voice of The Darkness. How cool is that? Although there’s a swarm of games coming soon that will no doubt take away the much deserved attention for The Darkness, it’s one of the best games released this year, and shouldn’t be overlooked by anyone who’s looking for that square-pegged game to sink their teeth into.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Electronic Arts is mostly known for its sports games, so it\\'s very unlikely that an action title coming from the powerhouse is looked forward to. Army of Two, a highly anticipated action title from EA Montreal has completely changed that stereotype. But the question is, is Army of Two any good? The only answer to that question is a resounding yes. Army of Two is the best action title to be released so far this year. This is in thanks to its superb cooperative mechanics, brutality, and story.  You play as either Elliot Salem or Tyson Rios, two former army rangers, who have made the switch to mercenaries, as they believe that the pay is much better this way. Salem is much more of a kid, who jokes around, and is really casual in his combat. Rios, on the other hand, is much more mature in his stature, and is very professional. The duo get along great, and are a tough group that stick together through the rough. That, being a good thing, of course, as the two are set up, and end up with their former allies against them. Their journey takes place over 16 years, and takes them to places all over the world, from the middle east, to a hurricane ridden Miami. The camaraderie that the two share is unseen in any other game, and you really begin to root for them, as it seems that it\\'s two against the world in this one.  What is a little unfortunate, is even though the game takes place over 16 years, the actual campaign is only a mediocre 6 hours. This is extremely disappointing, as the entire game is just a non stop roller coaster ride, and you\\'d wish that it\\'d be longer. You feel as though the story needed some more open space to expand, and 6 hours just doesn\\'t give it enough room. That doesn\\'t make the story any less effective, it just makes it shorter.  There has been some confusion on this, but I can clear things up. Army of Two is 100% a third person shooter. On this current generation, the genre has seen an uprising. Gears of War, Uncharted, and Kane and Lynch have all been ambassadors for the genre, opening it up and letting people know the action that it brings. This is no different in Army of Two. You have an arsenal of weapons spanning all areas. There are assault rifles, snipers, rocket launchers, basically every weapon known to man, you can handle it.  There\\'s no distinct cover system in Army of Two. You can slide into cover, and duck, and blind fire, but you never become magnetically stuck to a wall, for say, like you can in Gears or Uncharted. This is very smooth, and works unbelievably well, and it is very satisfying to do so, and you also feel very safe when doing so. It\\'s innovative and simple to use, and is one of the best aspects of the game.  Melee attacking is somewhat confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it, it can be your best friend. Being a certain distance away from an enemy, and pressing the right trigger, will have you do a melee attack, which may or may not kill them in one hit. This is either a kick to the head, an elbow to the head, or a chokeslam. Sometimes, blood will fly everywhere when you snap his neck, or break his head open, and it is a real breath of fresh air every time you do this. Sometimes the computer can\\'t tell whether you want to shoot or melee, so it can be a little tricky.  The enemy AI is decent overall, but sometimes they will absolutely destroy you, and other times, will run right in front of you and do nothing. It\\'s inconsistent, and adds to the variety in gameplay. Your partner AI is actually very good. If you tell him to go on a rampage, he will likely clean house. If you tell him to stay and fire, he will do so without hesitation. He almost never does the wrong thing, although in one instance, the AI just shut off altogether, leaving me alone.  What\\'s very innovative in Army of Two, is the aggro system. Aggro is how much attention you are receiving from the enemy. If you have all the aggro, you can send your partner around to flank enemies, as they will all be focused on you. If he has all the aggro, (which you can command him to do), you will be left alone. This is really cool, and always works well. It\\'s very similar to the aggro in World of Warcraft, if you\\'ve ever played that, you will be familiar with the system. There are a few enemies that are armored on the front, and can only be attacked from behind. Here\\'s where you\\'ll need to have one member decoy from the front, while you sneak around the back. this is where the aggro system stands out.  There are a few hovercraft sections, which aren\\'t actually all that fun, and feel really tacked on. Luckily, these are rare and short. There are some parachute/sniping sections which are actually very fun, and there are back to back sections, in which case you have unlimited ammo, and are surrounded. The time goes in slo mo, and it\\'s really fun and bloody when these sections come up. Also, if the aggro is fully on one character, you have the ability to go into overkill. Here, you become twice as powerful as before, and have unlimited ammo. This last about 15 seconds, and is essential in certain areas.  Some of the AI issues I mentioned before, can be avoided by doing coop with another human being. Here, you two communicate in ways you never have before in a video game, and it just becomes so much fun. If you manage to get along well, Army of Two will be an outstanding addition to your library. It\\'s so hard to explain just how much better the game is with another human. The partner AI isn\\'t bad, it\\'s just 100 times better with someone else. You can also do coop online, with a public player, or a private game you can set up with a friend.  Graphically, Army of Two is a good looking game. The blood looks fantastic, as does the water, and vistas. What stands out are the character models, although they do get repetitive. Some environments could have been smoothed out, and they could\\'ve been more destructible, but overall, the game looks good.  Even though there are a ton of curse words, the voice actors deliver a great performance. Salem and Rios share normal conversations in the midst of battle, and it becomes such a casual affair. Killing is a chore to these guys. The soundtrack really fits every situation well, as every EA game does have a great soundtrack. It\\'s no different here.  There are 3 online modes, and 4 maps, which add to the longevity of the game. Without these, the game wouldn\\'t be worth your money. Luckily, the game modes are fun, and are worth money, to \"pimp\" your weapons (turn to gold), purchase new ones, and new masks, to add to your collection. Upgrading weapons can become a hobby, and is really addictive.  Army of Two is a great game. It\\'s not outstanding by any means, but it brings a lot of new things to the table. Hopefully, a sequel will have even better to show for it in the future. If you have a friend, roommate, or sibling, and are looking for a bloody good time, pick up Army of Two. If you are looking for that third person shooter fix, then Army of Two also fits. There are a few great ideas not executed greatly, but still work out well enough for one hell of a game.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Let\\'s face it, most video games are a dime a dozen. Every genre has its standard bag of tricks. The simple premise of shooters makes them an easy target. Run. Shoot. Kill. Gears of War changes it up slightly. Here, running around in the open will quickly get you killed, making your only alternative to take cover behind anything you can find. Walls, columns, doorways, rubble, sandbags, couches. Like in real combat, if the enemy can see you, you\\'re already dead.  The campaign plays out over a series of Acts each with about 5 chapters where you take on the role of Marcus Fenix; an imprisoned soldier of the Coalition of Organized Governments (COG), commonly known as, Gears. An apparently, tough as dirt team of huge soldiers wearing bigger armor - that, despite lots of wear and tear, has a tendency to be exceptionally shiny on the edges. The story never really explains, or even hints at why you were imprisoned, though it becomes quickly obvious that you\\'re not entirely welcome back on the force.  Your first mission will be to escape the abandoned prison where you\\'ve been held - with the aid of the man that\\'s busting you out in the first place. First time players will have the option of completing a brief game play tutorial before jumping into the battle, while experienced players can get right to the action. From here on out you can expect a lot of non-stop peek-and-shoot combat as you battle against the Locust. An alien invasion that\\'s managed to embed itself underground in a series of complex tunnels in its ongoing effort to eliminate the human race. Your objective will be to place a type of \\'bomb\\' called the Resonator, that will map these tunnels. Once the tunnels are mapped, a massive bomb will be used to eradicate the Locust.  Personally, I felt the difficulty of Gears stays pretty constant throughout the campaign. Although some characters are tougher than others, really, no stage of the game is more difficult than others. The challenge will come mostly from the number of enemies you have to face. On the easiest setting (Casual), this is never overwhelming and you can usually depend on your teammates to do a fair job of assisting. As you up the difficulty, however, you\\'re faced with greater numbers and your teammates seem to get dumber. You can generally count on someone dying in just about every fight and in the bigger fights, you\\'ll more often be the last one standing. There is an ability to revive your teammates in the midst of a fight, but this usually means running into whatever clearing they were dumb enough to get into in the first place, in which there\\'s little chance for survival. Alternatively, killing all the enemies will revive everyone automatically and this is most often the way to go. Most of the battles can be pretty intense, especially as you up the difficulty, but many enemies have a simple weakness that, once exploited, make certain scenes a bit too easy and anti-climatic. Part of the fun, I think, is discovering these weaknesses by simply observing how different characters behave. But once you find them, they become somewhat routine.  Overall though, the difficulty could have used a bit more tweaking. From \"Casual,\" the next setting is \"Hardcore\" and from there you go to \"Insane.\" By name alone it sounds like a big jump and it certainly translates to gameplay. Enemies don\\'t necessarily become harder to kill, there are mearly more of them and they have better accuracy. If you were able to cruise through the story on the Casual setting, you\\'ll find yourself replaying many fights over and over as you up the difficulty. These are almost random fights though and not the \"boss\" fights that you\\'d expect to be tougher. Personally, I found the upping the difficulty had the most impact on fights when normally weak enemies swarm over you is giant numbers. As your AI teammates become more and more ineffective, this can get frustrating. Yet, the areas that feel like they were meant to be the most challenging were still relatively easy.  Though most of the game employs the same tactics of taking cover, then popping out momentarily to shoot, there are a few instances where the pacing is changed up such as driving the \"Junker\" through a rubble covered highway while fending off the flying Kryll or trying to defeat enemies that can\\'t be killed through conventional weapons.  Really what defines Gears of War is your ability to take cover with the tap of a button. Obviously, hiding behind objects is nothing new and more and more games are using a cover mechanism. But Gears does it so seamlessly, with such fluidity, that the action become effortless and natural. In reality, there are few times when you won\\'t be behind cover and once there, you\\'ll have a number of options to poke your head out and shoot or quickly move to another position all while staying as hidden as possible.  Gears\\' simple, yet effective, means of taking cover is just one of the many aspects that set it apart from other shooters. To state the obvious, Gears of War is visually remarkable. The fact that is just won at the Video Game Awards for Best Graphics is a testament to this. But as with anything, it\\'s the attention to detail that allows something to rise above the rest. With Gears of War, it\\'s hard to feel as though any detail was left out. Textures are tremendously rich and never looked aliased or stretched. Smoke rises in clouds and wisps from burning buildings and cars. Rain comes down in heavy sheets against a black sky as it falls on drenched mud, concrete and steel.  Above all, the lighting sets an intense and brooding mood; adapting well to whatever location you\\'re in - whether it\\'s being filtered through paned glass, burning red from a sky of fire, or barely there at all as you struggle to avoid being decimated by what lies in the darkness. Gears also manages to find a good balance of visibility in light and dark while still maintaining excellent contrast and definition.  Gears offers a simple, attractive interface that matches the gritty, destroyed feel of the game. Though the only time you\\'ll notice it is in the game selection menu. While fighting, everything disappears leaving no part of your view obscured. While you\\'re shooting you\\'ll get a small display showing your current weapon and ammunition level - which disappears when not being used. If you get a hit, a red gear will appear in the middle of the screen and grow in intensity as you take more damage. Stay out of the line of fire long enough and it, too, will disappear as your health recovers. Your health also recovers fairly quickly which helps keep the game moving quickly. A nice balance since you don\\'t have much health to begin with. One of my favorite features of the interface - though one you hope to never see - is when you\\'ve taken heavy damage - or are in the midst of grinding up a Locust with your mounted chainsaw, is the thick blood that\\'s splattered across the screen. At times it can be so thick that it\\'s hard to see a thing, giving a great sense of panic to already intense situations.  For such a high quality game, it\\'s a shame that the voice acting isn\\'t held to the same standard. That\\'s not to say that it\\'s bad, the pacing is just very choppy and the voices don\\'t really match the size and toughness of the characters. The dialog itself is pretty decent however, and characters will make remarks throughout the campaign, whether scripted or situational, that really adds flavor and suits their personalities well. In other aspects, the audio is exceptional and everything sounds just as good as it looks. You\\'ll really feel explosions or the sudden presence of an Emergence Hole just by the way they sound. Gameplay is complemented by a variety of musical scores that adapt to the situation and accentuate the feel of the environment yet are never distracting or overpowering.  It\\'s a shame that this game only clocks in at around 10 hours. Even a more polished and thought out storyline could have made up for the short campaign. If you enjoy playing through the same story over and over, you\\'ll get some good replay value by completing the game on the different difficulty levels - though completing it on Hardcore will automatically unlock the points for Casual. (You\\'ll have to beat it once to unlock Insane.) The bulk of replay here is going to come from the co-op and online multiplayer modes. Both of which are well implemented and easy to get into. While playing through the campaign alone, you can even have a friend jump in at any point and take control of one of your AI teammates. For those that count Achievement Points, there\\'s a hefty dose to be had in the multi-player mode for everything from hosting a certain number of sessions to getting kills in different ways. And although none of the Achievements come easily (with the exception of completing the Training Mission), none of them seem impossibly out of reach.  In the end, Gears of War is a worthy addition to the Shooter genre. It offers a nice change of pace by bridging the gap between typical Run-N-Gun shooters and slower, tactical, squad based action. There\\'ll be no surviving if you simply run out hoping to take everyone down before they can kill you, but there\\'s a sense of urgency and a fluid rhythm that keeps the game play moving at a steady clip.',\n",

       "  'description': 'There have been 3 previous Devil May Cry games, the first being one of the greatest action games of all time, the second being one of the most disappointing sequels of all time, and the third being one of the hardest action games of all time. Everybody gasps when I tell them I have never played one before, and all look at me in horror. Well, after hearing almost nothing but good things about the fourth in the series, I decided to give it a try. Is it a disappointment like the second one was, or does it join the first and the third? I seriously have no idea. All I know is that Devil May Cry 4 is amazing, and is the best game to be released this year.  This is the definition of a polished game. The studio has poured their souls into this game, and it really shows. The game on the easiest difficulty will take you 8 - 10 hours, but there are 6 difficulties to go through, and you keep all your skills as you progress. There are a ton of secret missions that will take your unbroken attention and skill. Once you complete the game, you unlock some new art in the art gallery, and the history of DMC. The extras are plenty, but aren\\'t to the extent of a limited edition. After each mission, you get graded on your time, your style, and your attention to detail. There are leaderboards worldwide, and gives you more ambition to play. On top of that, the game is just flat out fun, and you\\'ll want to play it through over and over again. The framerate never drops from a solid 60 the whole game,which is a real treat. Ps3 owners hardly ever get that, and it\\'s really appreciated when it does happen. There are no glitches to be found in the game, minus a few instances of clipping. There\\'s a lot of stuff in this game, and it is worth the price of admission.  I\\'m not the only newcomer to the series, so it\\'s really great that while continuing the story of the series, DMC 4 is easy to follow as a seperate game on its own.  The story revolves around the coastal town of Fortuna, a town inhabited by followers of Dante\\'s father, Sparda. A gathering is right away amushed by Dante, who assassinates the leader of the Order. Nero confronts Dante, and the two get into a battle, that Nero obviously loses from the start. The Order sends Nero out on a quest to capture Dante, and bring him to justice. Along the way, Nero battles demons, meets some intriguing characters, who aren\\'t as they seem, and his girlfriend gets kidnapped. Nero\\'s thoughts on who to trust, and who not to trust are shaken throughout the game, making for some very thought provoking moments that are unforgettable.  The only way that the story is told is through cutscenes. These are very frequent, and are a real treat. Every cutscene is choreographed greatly, and there is some very witty dialogue. Both Nero and Dante are against authority, and they show it through their heavy sarcasm, and ability to take harsh situations lightly. They love to insult each other, as well as the demons around them, making you absolutely love every single line thrown out by these guys. I don\\'t know if this is in the other games of the series, but it is rampant in Devil May Cry 4.  What gets me, though, is although the cutscenes look great, they could easily been incorporated into gameplay. I\\'m not saying they had to be in game fights, but some kind of quick time event needed to happen. It unfortunately didn\\'t but I can get over it. Maybe I\\'d cramp the game\\'s style.  The story\\'s characters are all very well developed, and you fall in love with them. Every character has their own tone and feel, and it just makes the game feel so organic. Every person in the game is well explained, and everything just feels right when you are watching the story unfold.  This is a stunning game. The facial animations are fantastic, as well as full body animations, both in game, and in cutscenes. Every texture is well realized, the water effects are good, and everything runs at a brisk 60 frames. This is a game to look at if you want to show off your system to a friend. The artistic style is great, the demons are all very unique, and the environments are all very good. The only real issue is the shadows. for 270 degrees, every shadow looks sharp and fantastic. For the other 90 degrees, every shadow is very pixelated. This wouldn\\'t be such an issue, if one sixth of the game wasn\\'t spent in the jungle. After playing something like Uncharted: Drake\\'s Fortune, I can\\'t really look past this with ease. Another issue with the shadows, is that at one part of the game, a puzzle requires you to go in the opposite direction of your shadow, forcing you to look at the hideousness. This probably won\\'t bother many, but I really won\\'t forget it. Other than that, the game is a real feast for the eyes.  The environments you\\'ll see include the town, dark mines, evil labs, lush jungle, and \"hell\"? Each one is different from the other and it keeps things fresh.  The soundtrack is full of these really cool electric metal songs. It\\'s really unique, and makes you feel like such a stud when you\\'re in battle. Not one song (minus the end credits) is bad, and actually, every song is worth getting on your mp3. The dialogue is very clever and funny, and is also very well delivered. The only questionable voice is the one for Agnus, but that\\'s probably because I hate his guts. The sound is very unique, and is just as uber stylized as the cutscenes.  I know I\\'ve been complimenting this game on the other four categories, but the game play is what makes me love this game. The game is damn near perfect when it comes to this. You play as Nero, and as Dante, but I\\'ll get to playing as Nero first.  Nero has a lack of weapons in his arsenal,but he still brings it. He has a sword, a pistol with unlimited ammo, and a possessed right arm, which he uses to grab enemies, toss them around, and rip them to shreds. You\\'ll come up with a lot of creative combos. My favorite while playing with Nero was tossing enemies up in the air with my sword, jumping up to them, hitting them to the ground, grabbing them up to me with my arm(devil bringer), and tossing them to the ground again using my devil bringer. Of course, the variety of enemies causes you to come up with new combos that you\\'ll need to use.  As Dante, who you get to play as halfway through the game, everything is changed. You no longer have the devil bringer, but you do have some really cool stuff. You have 4 different styles to use. There\\'s trickster, which allows you to dodge attacks faster than normal, Royalgarde, which lets you block almost anything, Swordmaster, and Gunslinger. Everybody has their favorite style, as mine was trickster. However, you\\'ll need to change your style frequently to adjust to the enemies. Dante has his large sword, Rebellion, his twin pistols, Ebony and Ivory, Coyote, his shotgun, and the coolest thing in the history of the world. But I won\\'t spoil that.  Dante also has 3 different weapons. Rebellion, of course, but he also has 2 others that are very helpful for certain situations. Switching weapons is made possible on the fly, due to the L2 and R2 buttons. Due to the sensitivity of the buttons, this is a breeze to pull off, and it becomes essential.  What\\'s really cool about DMC 4 is the lack of realism, while maintaining the fun. When you shoot at an enemy in the air, they will remain in the air as long as you continue to shoot. Same goes for you, if you are in the air, and you shoot, you will stay in the air. It adds to the uniqueness of the game, and again, its something that\\'s really appreciated. Some people may not like it, but I certainly loved it.  You can pull the right trigger to lock on to enemies, and the game\\'s controls are very responsive, keeping everything dynamic. Locking on is essential for combat, and you\\'ll use it frequently.  There are a ton of combos you can purchase throughout the game, and you can refund them for other ones, if they don\\'t work out. I\\'ve played for just over 15 hours, and I\\'ve barely scratched the surface. You can upgrade everything you have, and it\\'s incentive to get you to be stylish in your play.  There are a few puzzles, but they are just lumps in the gameplay dominated by the swordswinging, and gun shooting.  There is never a dull fight in DMC 4. Due to the number of combos available, every single fight will be interesting and fun. The boss fights are proof of this. There are about 6 bosses throughout the game, and you fight each on at least twice. However, they never get old. It sound repetitive, but it just isn\\'t, because of how much fun it is and the style that each fight brings.  The combat is just flat out fun. It is the best aspect of the game. The animations are all fluent, and each enemy has a way of being taken down. The fun is figuring that out, then executing on your plan. The combos that you can pull off, will sometimes have your jaw hit the floor, because it was just so cool and satisfying.  The latter difficulties are actually very hard. The last one, actually being on par with Ninja Gaiden in terms of difficulty. Meaning, when you complete the game, you feel like you have accomplished something. You really need to think about what you are doing.  The only real issue about the gameplay is the camera. It can be at the worst of places at times, taking you out of the action for a second while you adjust it. The other issue about that, is when you go into a room, the fixed camera changes, and sometimes you\\'ll be running in the opposite direction. This sometimes has you running into a room, then running out just as fast. It gets annoying, but you\\'ll get the hang of it.  Even though I\\'ve never played any other Devil May Cry games, I absolutely love Devil May Cry 4. The game is polished to a shine, it\\'s very pretty and unique to look at, the gameplay is fast and furious, the story is fantastic and classy, and there are a ton of extras enough to bring you back for 3 or 4 outings. If you are a fan of fun games, look no further than Devil May Cry 4. It is one of the best action games I\\'ve ever played, and it belongs in your console. Everything about this game, will have you feeling like a total stud while playing.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Games that force you to use a controller other than the one that came with your console have seen a surge last generation, with games like DDR, and Guitar Hero. Both franchises have seen success, especially the latter. Developer Harmonix studios already knows this, and that's why they've decided to create Rock Band, the music game claiming to be the best party game ever. Is Rock Band what it claims to be? The answer overall, is yes, but that isn't to say Rock Band doesn't have its problems.  The game, along with drums, one guitar, and a microphone is $160. This wouldn't be such a problem if that is what everything is worth. However, the durability of the equipment is questionable, and the track list isn't lengthy enough. The drums are made of thin metal, plastic, and rubber. The metal and plastic should hold up, except for the foot pedal. This thing is basically a toddler toy, and undoubtedly will snap, if vigorously stomped on. The drums themselves are made of rubber, which is great, and suppresses sound fairly well, but they collect dust over time, and are impossible to clean, without a vacuum. The microphone, is simply a microphone, that isn't even cordless, and the guitar, actually is well put together, in comparison to everything else.  The tracklist is held together by about 55 songs, which isn't as much as Guitar Hero III's 72. There are some really great tracks, including songs by Jet, Blue Oyster Cult, The Killers, The Who, Nine Inch Nails, and Radiohead. These will have you rocking out to the best of your abilities. Unfortunately, about a third through the career mode, the good songs stop. The horrific R.E.M., David Bowie, and Fallout Boy contaminate your eardrums. Of course, there are people who will love every song in the game, but since this is my review, I get to say what I thought. I say that more than half of the songs either suck, or are by unknown artists. This is a little disappointing, especially for a music game, that focuses itself around its music. There should be some DLC later on, but it's not free, and not many will be willing to pay even more for the already overpriced game.  Rock Band plays a lot like Guitar Hero. Color coded notes come across a bar, and you have to hit the notes as they come to the edge of the screen. For drums, this is either hitting the green, red, yellow, or blue pads, or the foot pedal, when the orange bar comes across the screen. The controls are responsive to an extent, and the learning curve is really easy if you've played a Guitar Hero before. It's fun as always, and is really simple. It's pretty solid.  Playing the guitar or bass, is the exact same controls as Guitar Hero. However, things are a bit easier. Expert mode in Rock Band is about the equality of Hard mode in Guitar Hero III. This opens up the game to a more casual audience, and makes the game accessible to anyone. Also, this goes for the drums as well, is the freestyle moments. here, there are no notes on the screen, and you can just hit any notes you want, giving the song a bit of your own flavor. This is welcomed, and Guitar Hero can learn a lot from this.  Vocals is a little tricky. Unlike karaoke, it's not about reading the lyrics onscreen, its about hitting the right notes at the right time. This makes you feel a lot like a rock star, but is really difficult, and can be embarrassing, when your band keeps failing because their singer's voice hasn't cracked yet. I suggest you pick straws to see who has to do voacls, if your have a 3 or 4 man group.  There is a World Tour mode, available offline only, and this is just a long list of songs. Your venue changes every 5 songs, but that's about it. There are a ton of character customizations you can do, but you won't touch them much. Near the later stages, the song list really disintegrates and Fallout Boy destroys your mind. In the end, all world tour comes down to, is trying to unlock more songs for quickplay.  What's really awesome is how your band rocks out on the screen. The character models are sharp, the art style is cool, and the animations are all realistic. It's really great the Harmonix is taking the power of our consoles into consideration. It's nothing like Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, but it is a very nice looking game.  Either by yourself, or with 3 friends, Rock Band is a fantastic game. It is a great party game, and will likely replace karaoke at Filipino parties. Plenty will disagree with my takes on World Tour, and the price of the game, as well as the songlist, but it's my opinion that all those are poor. That aside, plenty will agree with my takes on just how innovative and fun that the game is. If you have 160 bucks to spend, then undoubtedly, you should pick up Rock Band. Many won't.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Few games have style, few games have something more than style. SSX has both style and something more to it that just an snowboarding game.SSX has two main modes, each with 4 different event styles. The first modes is single event. The singel event \\xa0 allows one run through any event style and on any courses you've unlocked. World Circuit mode lets you choose a charcacter and build their statsThese to modes have warm up, Race, Showoff and Freeride. Warmup is a tutorial that takes place on a special course. During the run, you will be given audio and visual tips on how to maneuver your character and bust out tricks. For each course in Race, you must qualify at least 3rd in Quarterfinals, Semifinals and Finals. In Showoff, it's all about the tricks. Cross the finish line with the highest point total and you're the winner. And finally, Free ride allows unlimited practice on any of the courses you've unlocked during world circuit play.The game consist of 8 characters, which can be played both in singel event and in world circuit (Once they are unlocked)Mac Fraser (American)Moby Jones (British)Elise Riggs (Canadian)Kaori Nishidake (Japanese)Jurgen Angermann (German)JP Arsenault (French)Zoe Payne (American)Hiro Karamatsu (Japanese)The games controls reminds me of the THPS controlls. They are responsitive enough for you to go bananas with the tricks, and accurate enough for that tight curve near the finish line. The 4 shoulder buttons are used for the tricks. The left analog stick or the d-pad will control the path of  the boarderEach course is filled with ramps, rails, jumps, and other assorted objects. Performing tricks fills up the player's boost meter, which can then be used for additional acceleration, making tricks are important even in a race. While some tricks do have origins in snowboarding, many of the more advanced tricks are not realistic to actual physics. This matters little in games of this style, as the larger and more extreme tricks count for the most points and are the most spectacular to execute. The music in the game have a nice verarity from artsist such as; Rasmus, And Mickey Finn, just to name a few. the music really brings that extra edge when you are grasping for air in a stunning high paced race down the Tokyo curcuit. The only downside with SSX are the FPS drops that comes and goes. Nothing that ruins the game itself but sometimes it can be a little anoying. Overall, if you like something out of the ordinary you should buy SSX. \",\n",

       "  'description': 'Viva Piñata from Rare Ltd. is by far the most adorable game ever created in video game history. I know you might be thinking, what about Spyro, Elebits, or even Nintendogs? Believe me, they don’t even come close. I admit the little creatures from Pikmin are quite cute, but the animals in Viva Piñata are so adorable that even the most hardened criminal who registers as a level 22 on Dr. Stones Scale of Evil wouldn’t disagree.The gameplay can be compared to that of the Sims in the sense that you are free to do pretty much whatever you want. You are a gardener who is given a neglected piece of land on Piñata Island. In the beginning you meat Leafos, a native american looking young lady who is crying about how run down and ghetto her land has become. Only you can restore it to its former glory. Only you can prevent wildfires….  From there what you can do is seemingly endless. Your main goal is to create a beautiful garden and attract piñatas to come live, grow, and eventually be chosen to go entertain at parties. You begin with a few basic tools and soon you attract the simplest of piñata animals like the Whirlm and Taffly. Each visitor that shows up in your garden will appear black & white in color, until you meet its conditions to stay and become a resident in your garden. For the simple piñatas like the Whirlm, the requirements are fairly simple, clear some garbage, plant some grass, don’t pick your nose for a day, etc. As you continue to grow and customize your garden, your gardener level increases and you attract more and more (and subsequently cuter) piñatas. The game gets more challenging as you go on; sour piñatas (a.k.a bad guys) come and mess things up and make your piñatas sick, piñatas become frustratingly harder to attract to your garden (I’m talking to you, Elephanilla), and mating becomes quite a chore.  Yes, mating. A little hot piñata-on-piñata action (ok, not quite like that). After fulfilling certain mating requirements such as buying a house for each particular species, which are also incredibly cute, the piñatas fall in love, do a little Romance Dance, and before you know it, you have a baby piñata who is tiny and, yes, somehow even more adorable than his/her parents. Evidentially, all of the Piñatas are asexual because all they have to do is a dance to create offspring. They also apparently don’t have problems with incest, since you can (and usually have to) mate the offspring of a species with its parents or sisters and brothers. After mating Whirlm #1 and #2, its offspring, Whilrm #3 (don’t worry, to keep them straight you can name them if you want) definitely did not have any qualms about mating with its mom or dad….or, eventually, its sister or brother or cousin or Uncle Billy Bob…Git-R-Done!  A cool feature to note is your ability to go into town and buy cute little accessories for your piñatas like baseball hats and mustaches  (if you want your piñata to look like a child molester) or other charming pieces of flair (”Joanna, we need to talk about your flair…”). One of the best parts of the game is the names of the piñatas. Most have clever and, of course, quite cute names that combine food/candy and the animals name. Horstachio (horse + pistachio), Bunnycomb (bunny + honeycomb), Taffly (taffy + fly), Elephanilla (elephant + vanilla), Cocoadile (crocodile + cocoa)….you get the point. So, I bet you’re asking, what do you do with the piñatas? Well you can keep them around, mate them, send them off to parties, sell them for chocolate coins (the currency on Piñata Island) or sacrifice them as food to bigger piñatas to satisfy residency and romance requirements. Weirded out yet? Keep reading… When one piñata eats another it sort of hurls strange projectiles at the other piñata, killing it. It explodes with candy and confetti sending surrounding piñatas into a carnivorous rush towards their slain comrade in an effort to consume its spilled innards. You’ll experience a sick joy seeing happy Piñatas feasting on the candy of a ruptured piñata carcass. The graphics are great. Colorful and happy. The music is nothing special but the animal sounds are, for the most part, adorable, with the exception of the snores from the sleeping Horstachio or the whimpering cries of sick or unhappy piñatas. For those obsessed with upping their Xbox gamerscore (cough, Donnie) there are 50 achievements that you collect throughout the game. What I thought would be a simple and easy game turned out to be a compelling and deceptively complex strategy game. You start with a shovel and some dirt. Simple. You get a worm. Next thing you know, you’re 50 hours into it, hunting down he elusive Chewnicorn. Be forewarned, this game is extremely addictive – I’m talking cocaine covered in milk chocolate with an extra side of caffeine addictive. I cannot wait for\\xa0 Viva Piñata 2.\\xa0 Can. not. wait.\\xa0 More pinatas, interactive gameplay. Penguins, camels, snow.... All my dreams and more.

       "  'description': 'If I had to sum up this game in one word, it would be \"important\".Ninja Gaiden 2 is a breath of fresh air in a world of grey and brown filters and military fetishism. Similar to how Serious Sam & Painkiller showed up and laughed in the face of all the piss-easy, cinematic, shallow shooters, Ninja Gaiden 2 kicks down the door, slits the throat of all these action “games,” then nonchalantly flings the blood off its blades into a glorious splatter on the walls. The game is about timing…quick, precise, meticulous, clockwork movements through wave after wave of brutally intelligent enemies. You must constantly be on guard, paying attention, reacting to every subtle enemy movement, able to spot if a werewolf is going to do a grab or a sudden aerial attack, knowing that a centipede’s aerial dive can only be avoided by dashing forwards or jumping backwards, knowing the last two hits of an XXYY Kusari-gama combo make you invincible…these are the thoughts you need to be focused on to even think of succeeding in this game on anything above Easy. The moment you start thinking about what you had for lunch, you die. The entire game is designed around the exploitation of the invincibility windows granted by certain moves, to an even greater degree than its predecessor. You need to pull off that OT right before the rocket barrage hits you to survive the entire thing without a scratch. You need to launch that UT quickly before those exploding kunai you’ve been stuck with explode. You need to aim those Piercing Void shots so they plow through as many giant spider fiends as possible at once, and you only have 3 seconds to line up that shot. In this game, the spectacle is what you can do in the game with the proper amount of time and skill invested. All those incredibly choreographed fight scenes with Dante and Solid Snake that you wish you could pull off in-game…well with a bit of time and a lot of patience, you’ll be pulling off sequences of moves in Ninja Gaiden 2 that far surpass those of any cutscene. A few properly timed button presses and you’ll be piledriving a ninja mage over and down a three story high ledge and smirking as he explodes in a gorenado on the stone below. This game is not for people who just want to make it to the end.\\xa0 The satisfaction in this game doesn’t come from knowing Ryu saved the big boobed chick from the evil demon and lived happily ever after.\\xa0 This game is there for the ones who want to climb the ranks of difficulties and leaderboards; the ones who want to try weapon runs, speed runs, no item runs, and projectile only runs. If you’re a fan of action games in any capacity, and especially if you’re looking for a rewarding challenge, Ninja Gaiden 2 will welcome you with open arms, lovingly embrace you, then snap your neck.\\xa0 It is an updated, modern homage to the elders of the 8 and 16-bit era; before\\xa0Nintendo started making games for the people who watch Oprah.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Dark Sector is possibly the coolest game to come out yet this year. That doesn\\'t necessarily make it the best game, but it\\'s a guarantee that a game where you control a superhuman, and battle men with guns, as well as monsters has more than a few merits.  In Dark Sector, you control US Super Cool Secret Agent Hayden Tenno, and your mission is to stop a bunch of terrorists from unleashing an evil disease upon the world. Early on, Hayden is infected with a \"special\" form of the disease, where he begins to turn to metal and transform. One of the awesomest coolest badass parts about this game is the glaive. This is a 3 sided blade that grows out of Hayden\\'s hand, and he can throw it like a boomerang slicing and dicing his way to justice. Hayden also experiences weird changes that allow him to become invisible, and repel bullets. Invincibility may or may not be in the mix as well. All that I can say, is that Hayden is one powerful mofo, and he\\'s looking to kill anything and anyone in his path.  Now, that, being the basis for the story, you\\'d expect something a little more than what is on the table. The story in Dark Sector makes sense, but large portions of the game go by with absolutely no storytelling whatsoever. You\\'ll be in the sewer, or in a church, and you\\'ll have absolutely no clue what you\\'re doing there. At the end of the game, it leaves you unsatisfied. The 10 hour mark is long enough to have a deep twisty story, and there is nothing like that in this game.  Also, with the exception of Hayden, none of the characters are developed. There\\'s this old man, that\\'s a large part of the story, but half of people won\\'t even catch his name, and Hayden\\'s \"friend??\" whom he may know from his past, although it\\'s never said, is also a large part of the equation. It would\\'ve definitely helped out if the characters were deeper than they are.  Dark Sector consists of 10 chapters, with some of them taking an hour and a half, to some lasting just 20 minutes. Combined, everything comes together at about 9 or 10 hours, which is fairly lengthy by today\\'s standards. You\\'ll cover plenty of ground when the game is finished. Most levels are pretty wide open, yet most of the action will occur in tight corridors, with seemingly endless intelligent enemies. Hayden can kill them in many different ways.  Dark Sector utilizes a cover system, similar to the one in Gears of War. By pressing the bottom face button, you can press up against a wall. This works pretty well, although it does have a number of flaws. The inability to blind fire can make firefights frustrating, especially when you are near death. The only way to come off of a wall, is to roll away, or stop and slowly walk directly away from the cover. This is pretty annoying considering that everything is going at such a brisk pace. Also, it isn\\'t completely clear what is cover, and what is scenery. Sometimes, you will try to take cover on something, but Hayden will just roll into it, and you could actually get killed over and over before figuring out you can\\'t take cover on that object. The cover system works, but it could\\'ve been polished much more than it is.  When you are in cover, Hayden can kill lots. Using the glaive, Hayden can throw it a certain distance, and slice anything. When you hit a human with the glaive, he will scream all sorts of obscenities, and it\\'s always great to hear what their last words are. There\\'s also something called aftertouch, where wither using the right stick on the 360, or SIXAXIS on the Ps3, you can control the glaive in slow motion, and guide it into throats, or groins, or shins. Anything you wish. Aftertouch is also needed for some puzzles, such as hitting a lever or button that is unreachable. There is a variety of power throws, and the glaive can be set on fire. It\\'s pretty awesome, and let\\'s just say that you\\'ll have a lot of fun figuring it all out.  You can\\'t always use the glaive, unfortunately, and that\\'s why there is a small arsenal of weapons available to your disposal. You\\'ll always have your handy dandy pistol, which you can use in unison with the glaive, so you can slice, and then get the final blow with a headshot. There\\'s also a variety of shotguns (useful with zombies), and assault rifles. For those occasions when a helicopter is on your tail, there is a rocket launcher, with lock on capabilities. Aiming is pretty god, although it could\\'ve been a bit faster. Overall, shooting is pretty average, but the amount of blood in the game makes it above average. You\\'ll have a great time blasting things with your guns.  There is a market system, called the Black Market, where you can purchase new weapons using money you find. Here, you can also place weapons in a locker, since you can only hold 2 at a time. It\\'s similar to the merchant system in Resident Evil 4, considering that the merchant is once again, a scary old guy with a raspy voice.  There are two vehicle sections, that are a total blast. You have rockets, and a chain gun, and you just obliterate anything that comes into view. What\\'s an action game without vehicle sections? There are a few turrets in the game, but none of them work very well, and it makes the game feel like a mediocre first person shooter, when really, it\\'s a brutal third person acton game.  In addition to the 10 hour single player game, are two fun multiplayer modes. Infection is when there is a certain amount of players, and one of them is Hayden. Hayden has to kill everyone he can, and the only way to become Hayden is to kill him. It\\'s not so much fun when you\\'re a guard, but when you become Hayden, it can be a blast. Epidemic is when there are two teams, each of which have one Hayden, and you have to kill the other team\\'s Hayden. Again, when you kill the other team\\'s Hayden, you become the Hayden on your team. New players will have a rough time, but after about half an hour, you\\'ll get the hang of it. Multiplayer is a little shallow, but it will eat up a few hours of your time.  The level design has a bit of what I like to call \"Half Life 2 Sydrome\". This is when after all the action is finished, you\\'re left with an empty room, with no objectives list or radar, and you have no idea where to go. It\\'s usually a simple puzzle or closed door, but when you miss wide open hallways, then you know there\\'s a problem. It\\'s a big nuisance, and is very frustrating, and puts you in a crappy mood most of the time.  What makes up for that, is the theme of the game. Dark Sector has plenty of horror moments. Either in a dark sewer, blasting zombies, or walking through a quiet dark abandoned hospital, the level of immersion is very high, and puts you in the zone to keep pushing forward.  When an enemy is near death, or when you are right behind them, you can perform a finisher. This is very similar to Assassin\\'s Creed, where the camera zooms in, and you just mutilate the guy. And I mean MUTILATE. Hayden will cuts heads off, and impale zombies, and there\\'s blood everywhere. Maybe this is why it was banned in Australia.  Dark Sector has great presentation. The voice acting is near flawless, and the musical score is pretty good. What sets this game apart from other titles is how great it is graphically. Every texture is very sharp and clean, and character models are just as good. However, any lack of artistic presence is a little disappointing, but that doesn\\'t take away from how great the game looks, it just makes everything gray.  Overall, Dark Sector is highly recommended from me. It\\'s not a must buy, but you do need to play it. It\\'s a brutal, fun, third person shooter that has lots going for it. A lengthy single player experience, and fun multiplayer make it worth your while. Unfortunately, a floppy cover system and Half Life 2 syndrome can piss you off. Truth is, that you won\\'t find anything more bloody than Dark Sector this generation. Give it a shot.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Earthbound was originally released in 1994 and to this day, it is still better than most RPG's of it's kind. Sure, battle systems have grown more advanced, graphics have improved, and voice acting has been introduced. But if you’re looking for a completely original, unique, bold and memorable experience, pick up Earthbound for your SNES, and dive into a world that leaves a delicious taste in your mouth long after it’s over. Personally, I’ve have played this game from start to finish many times since ’94, and even today I am constantly amazed at how it’s held up over the years. The universe that is Earthbound is surprising vast, with beautiful urban settings, to crazy exotic locations, where you meet a wonderful cast of quirky characters, each with their own individually splendid personality.  The humor and atmosphere is incredibly offbeat, and it’s jokes of the RPG genre are brilliantly campy. Amazingly, Earthbound takes itself seriously at just the right moments, and you end up really caring for these people and the world that surrounds them. The sound that enchants this game is of the highest quality, with sound FX’s and musical scores that evoke varying degrees of emotion, and never manage to annoy. All things considered, there simply isn’t another RPG more deserving of a sequel or remake. Playing this, you might just realize that Earthbound transcends a mere videogame. This is a work of art.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Developer Io Interactive is capable of creating an immersing tone and feel to their games, as previously seen with the Hitman series. Deep and twisted characters have always been an important factor. Nobody has come close to Agent 47\\'s love of killing. I\\'m willing to bet that Io\\'s newest duo, Kane and Lynch don\\'t love killing as much, but they are just as sick and twisted.  The best thing that Kane and Lynch has going for it is its well developed story. Kane and Lynch have really deep, interesting back stories that are constantly referred to mysteriously, but are never really touched down upon. The two are put in a deadly situation, and must do the impossible, to stay alive themselves, and to save their loved ones.  A warning: Do not play Kane and Lynch in the presence of any small children. I\\'m not exaggerating here. Every fifth word is a profanity. Many people won\\'t find it offensive at all, and me, at the age I am, found it absolutely hilarious. Every character in the game says the F word at least once. Even the smallest roles.  What is expected out of something like that, is that Kane and Lynch develop a camaraderie and become brothers. Kane and Lynch are the exact opposite of that. They hate each other more at the end of the title, than they do at the start. This keeps the gritty style of the game, that you\\'ll get used to and hooked on.  However, as great as the story is, Io Interactive made a game. That game is good, but doesn\\'t live up to the story that keeps it flowing. As a third person shooter, Kane and Lynch has plenty of flaws. Enemy AI is questionable all the time. In several levels, enemies will just stand there, waiting to get shot down instantly. Squad AI doesn\\'t fair much better. The controls are often clunky and slow, and it can make situations downright impossible to pull off. There were several times where I felt like stopping right then, and give the game a 4.0.  Of course, that wouldn\\'t be fair to the game. Despite those huge flaws (Believe me, when I say huge. Those are the only issues in the whole game. Only three flaws. However, all three are huge, and effect gameplay in a big way, making some parts \"really gay Kane and Lynch has a lot of merits that deserve to be stated. The entire game runs at a real fast, kick ass, action move pace. Every level just swarms you with enemies, hardly giving you time to think. All you can do is blast away with anything you have available.  The shooting is very competent. After playing Army of Two, and Dark Sector, both of which had slippery shooting mechanics, it\\'s a breath of fresh air to play a game with well working aiming and recoil. The squad commands do work very well for the most part. You have the ability to tell your team to hold back, go ahead, attack, or stay by you. This is great, but if you choose to ignore the commands, your team will still get the job done, although occasionally they do go crazy.  Kane and Lynch also has a great cover system. Just pressing up against a wall, and you\\'ll easily take cover on it. You can blind fire with surprising precision, and you can lean out and aim. Enemies will also take cover, but they\\'re often retarded and will lean out for wayyyyyyyyyyyy too long. The cover system isn\\'t as smooth working as in Uncharted: Drake\\'s Fortune, but it does work out, and you will value it.  Getting back to the issues I found with the game, the controls are just too slow and clunky to make the game fun. Turning is awkward, character movements are slow, and animations are off. There are more than a few times where you\\'ll need precision to get through, and you\\'ll end up retrying parts over and over until you get it right.  The enemy AI is just dumb. They don\\'t have any techniques at all, and it\\'s as if the bad guy found their mercenaries in the Yellow Pages. What\\'s really uneven, is although it\\'s obvious that enemy IQ is 17, they have insane marksmanship, and will constantly snipe you out with pistols and assault rifles. You\\'ll hate it.  The campaign is only about 7 hours long, but the story\\'s so great, it\\'s worth doing twice, perhaps with a split screen friend. What\\'s really odd and unappreciated is the lack of online coop. This would\\'ve been okay for a Ps2 or Xbox game, but it doesn\\'t go by unnoticed in the next generation of gaming. It\\'s a shame.  The one multiplayer mode, Fragile Alliance is really good. 8 players all start off on one team, and try to rob a bank. Once the loot has been taken, you can try to take it all for yourself by killing a team mate. Then, you are on your own, and our team has to take you out. It\\'s really interesting, and fits the mood of trust and betrayal well. It\\'s no Call of Duty 4, but it is really fun, and is the best part of the game.  Kane and Lynch has poor graphics at a technical standpoint. Textures are bland, animations are weak, there\\'s lots of screen tearing, and framerate stutters. It doesn\\'t look bad, but it definitely doesn\\'t look good. At least the art style is great, and the atmosphere and mood is even better.  Dialogue is perfectly delivered, and the digital score is even better. There could\\'ve been more variety, but overall the sound quality is top notch.  So, that\\'s it for my Kane and Lynch review. It isn\\'t the best game out there, and it\\'s fairly generic, but the great story, characters, and well working shooting mechanics are all good. It\\'s definitely not the worst you can do for a 10 dollar rent. Fans of action will likely find something to like here.',\n",

What needs to be said probably already has, and better, but lets just say that GTA is one of the most singularly enjoyable games of all time. Even when you really delve into each aspect of the game, none of the gameplay elements really stands out as exceptional, and if you took just one gameplay element from the game and tried make a standalone game out of it, odds are that game would be getting a score somewhere around a 1 out of 5 (or lower, if even possible).

And yet, take all of these half baked elements and wrap them in a metropolitan environment that really has no equal, and you come out the other end with a very magical experience. It\\'s a toy world just tempting you to go wild within it.  That\\'s GTA3\\'s greatest and most groundbreaking accomplishment, making it\\'s world breathe with a real, almost tactile, sense of being. One of the real joys of the game is just driving around, taking in the sights and sounds, and coming to the realization of just how much time and care was put into the design and layout of Liberty City. Everything that should be in the environment is, and better than that, it all makes sense. Liberty City (and honestly every GTA since) IS GTA\\'s greatest and most interesting character. For that it gets HUGE props.  Along with it\\'s living, breathing, metropolis also comes it\\'s open ended gameplay. The standard by which all since have been measured. The amount of time that can be spent ignoring the missions/storyline and just cruising Liberty City creatively thinking, wondering, \"Can I get up there?\" or \"If I get up there, and then I decide to chuck grenades on that group of pimps down on the street, will the police be able to get me?\" is one of the biggest appeals of this game. Exploration and the overall sense that the city is just there for you to \"mess with\" is probably GTA\\'s greatest gameplay mechanic. I often wished that the consequences for my actions held greater weight over the long haul, but the overall sense of causing mass hysteria and then trying to \"get away with it\" is one of the best stress relievers since Asian massage.  The storyline is really nothing to write home about, but is a necessary evil if you want to unlock the entire environment of Liberty City and a few extras. Most missions are minimally difficult and consist of pretty standard fetch quests and escort missions. Things start getting more interesting and more varied towards the end, but that\\'s not really what you\\'ll be playing the game for. Sight seeing and exploration is the thing that sells this package, not it\\'s canned mobster wannabe storyline (which could probably be completed in just a hand full of hours to someone dedicated enough. It took me 5 years though if you need a scale for balancing :) ).  Overall GTA3 is a game that immerses you in it\\'s environment so deeply that you learn to ignore it\\'s sizable flaws. GTA3 is the video game equivalent of The Beatles. Everyone knows who they are, some people feel they are both over hyped, and yet a lot of things wouldn\\'t exist today without them. Both are pioneers. Love them or hate them, but you have to respect them. ',\n",

The game just continues to amaze me and i keep finding things that i have never found before and doing things that couldn't even imagine even though i have almost completed it twice. The graphics are stunning, and the fact that the game is set in 1960 means that there is plenty of colours and great and inventive designs and so you never get bored of the amazing scenery. And i can't mention graphics without saying how goddamn outstanding the water effects are. The storyline (don't worry there'll be no spoilers here) is so good with twists and new plots everywhere that keeps you guessing and makes you want to play it even more to find out what happens; you can really tell how much effort they have put into developing the storyline and adapting it to the other creative aspects of the game.I don't think there'll ever be another game that is quite as original as Bioshock for a very, very, very; long time.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Every time there is a new Gran Turismo release, their is a huge amount of hype to go with it. Polyphony Digital\\'s brought their baby onto this generation, with Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, and it hasn\\'t been any different. Fans of the series, and even newcomers, expect top notch visuals and driving gameplay. The question is if Polyphony was able to deliver. The absolute only answer to that is yes, and in fact, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue is the best game on the Playstation 3.  Now, you may be looking at my score and saying to yourself \\'WHAAAAA????\", but the score doesn\\'t match the words because this is just the prologue to a possibly better, and bigger, full GT experience that spare any tragedies, will undoubtedly be worthy of that illusive 10 from me. It would be the first to do so. So, you may be looking at the score I gave this, but if I gave this a 10, I\\'d have to give Gran Turismo 5 a 17.  The first thing you\\'ll notice about Gran Turismo 5 Prologue is the visuals. There are times where the game looks like a screenshot from real life. The car models are all impressively detailed, and the lighting effects are stellar. Your driver\\'s eyesight adjusts to the sun when you enter or exit dark areas, such as tunnels. It\\'s this kind of detail that makes you appreciate just how great a game looks. The tracks are also immensely detailed and realistic, the reflections in the cars look superb, and simply put, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue is one of the best looking games around. There are so many little things that constantly amaze you and will have you saying \"Wow, I can\\'t believe they took the time to do that.\"  If you\\'ve played any Gran Turismo games before, you know that they have great, realistic controls. Let me get this out of the way first: GT 4 has nothing on this. It\\'s hard to put into words just how great that this game drives. Turning is much more smooth, as is braking, traction has been \"next-gen-ified\", and the new first person view adds something special to the experience. Every car drives differently, and every car is actually fun to drive. Now, the 63 HP Suzuki Cappuccino actually feels like a car, instead of a tin can, like in previous games. Some people will say that Forza has the most realistic feel, but you really need to play this game for more than 10 seconds to realize that you\\'ve never seen anything like this before. Every car in the game feels unique. Every last millimeter of the car reacts realistically to gravity and the actual track you happen to be on. It really makes it feel like you are actually driving the car. Burnout is the only racing game that\\'s more fun than this, which is a huge increase from other titles in the series\\' past. Now, this really is The Drive of Your Life.  The new first person view is perfect. Every interior is done with superb accuracy and realism, the driver animations are great, and everything reflects on the windshield. It\\'s really well done, and is only rivaled by the same view in DiRT. Also, borrowing an idea from Forza, and making it better, there is a driving line available for use. It\\'s deadly accurate, and if you follow it properly, races can become a breeze. It\\'s solid.  There are just over 70 cars and 6 tracks in Prologue, which may not seem like a lot, but it does have more cars than Need for Speed ProStreet, and more courses than the latest Hot Shots Golf. So, if you think that the game is bare boned, think again. The 6 tracks are all very unique, ranging from the Eiger Nordwand from HD Concept, to the Daytona Oval. London, Suzuka, Fuji, and the series favorite High Speed Ring also make appearances. Each track feels great to drive.  The 70 cars all range differently from the Suzuki Cappuccino, to Kiki Raikkonen\\'s F1 Ferrari. You can unlock a few cars by winning races, but most are attained by being bought. I was able to finish all the challenges and races using just a handful of cars. It will take anybody a lengthy time to obtain every car in the game.  There are 3 classes full of races and challenges, but anybody can fly through all of them in about 10 hours. None of the races are particularly challenging, but there are a few that will test your skill pretty well. In addition to that, there is a complete online mode, where you can race others for credits. It\\'s a little laggy in some parts, and some racers will try to make you crash, but it does work well, and you\\'ll play it a lot. Gran Turismo has always had great split screen, and that\\'s no different in Prologue. 2 player split screen is available, and it can get really competitive if you can pick the right cars and tracks.  There\\'s also a pretty great soundtrack, and the engine sounds are top notch. There\\'s no other racing game that does this better, and Gran Turismo 5 Prologue really sounds great.  That\\'s about all there is to say about Gran Turismo 5 Prologue. It drives perfectly, looks perfect, sounds perfect, and has some pretty good tracks and game modes, and has a better sense of speed than any other GT before it. Even if you aren\\'t a die hard GT fan, you need to pick it up. It\\'s worthy of a 10, but then what would I give the REAL GT 5? Buy it.',\n",

       "  'description': \"The Orange Box includes 5 great games: Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Episode One, Half-Life 2: Episode Two, Portal, and Team Fortress 2. I'll compact my reviews into the following: Half-Life 2 (this includes EP 1 and 2), Portal, and TF2.  Half-Life 2 Bundle  In Half-Life 2 you play as Gordon Freeman, a scientist who, in the first Half-Life, unleashed a portal to Xen. In HL2 you face an alien race called the Combine, and throughout the game, as well as the episodes, you battle them, among creatures of Xen as well as antlions towards your everchanging objectives. The game is, for the most part, linear, but in a fun way. The scripted events are always engrossing, as you never leave your first-person as Gordon; characters have one-sided conversations (since Gordon never talks in any HL thus far), and so on. The facial animations, as well as the voice acting, is the best of any game I have ever played and is worth the $60 to experience, alone. The controls are fairly simple, you can change weapons, jump, use a flashlight, reload, interact (i.e. open doors, activate things, pick up objects), a fire function as well as alt. fire. Half-Life 2 itself will lend you 11 hours or so of gameplay, EP1 is roughly 2 hours, and EP2 is approximately 5 to 6 hours. Don't let the times of the Half-Life games, as a whole, be underestimated as all of the time spent playing each game is action-packed and fun; rarely does it ever get dull or boring.  Portal  In Portal you play as a nameless test subject in an experimental facility, and throughout 19 levels (as well as 6 advanced levels, and 18 medals to attain) you'll use portals to complete your tasks. One trigger controls the blue, the other controls the orange, when both portals are present they interconnect and you can go in one and come out the other. This provides a variety of different puzzles that are fun in their own way. The 19 levels will last you 2 to 3 hours, but the advanced levels and medals to obtain will add at least 5 to 10 more hours on top. Over-the-top humor compliments this amazing puzzle-based game.  Team Fortress 2  TF2 is a class-based multiplayer game, where the game is balanced where one class may be great against another, but is weak against a different one. It is all a lot of fun for up to 16 people, especially when you have friends that work together. There are 6 maps with set game types, so 2Fort has Capture the Flag while Granary has a territory type where if you stand in a set area, you will eventually regain it and you must take all the territories to win. What comes together is a lot of endless fun, as the controls are easy and the game is playable within minutes because of how simple and engrossing it is, with more depth the more you play.  Value  That's 23 hours of gaming, with lots of replayability, and a multiplayer aspect. There are also 99 achievements to allocate, ranging from easy, to unavoidable (i.e. story achievements), to downright out-of-the-way, such as carrying a gnome to a space ship, through 3 hours of gameplay. For $60, The Orange Box is a definite buy and I recommend you buy it at all costs. The graphics, controls, story, and just everything comes together. Hit me up on Xbox Live and tell me how you liked my review, because I sure love The Orange Box. Have fun.[This review was originally posted on GS on October 17th, 2007.]\",\n",

       " {'deck': 'Super Stardust HD is the definitive dual-joystick shooter.',\n",
       "  'description': \"Dual-Stick shooters is a glorious genre that got a serious revival through the next-gen consoles (ironbic twist of events considering it took processing muscle to bring back the simple top-down games). This renaissance of sorts for the genre was initiated by the release of Geometry Wars, which most can now agree outclassed every other title that polluted Xbox 360's launch line-up. People were blown away by the fast and gloriously shiny shooter, which proved to be surprisingly deep and addictive (despite the savants occupying the top rankings on the leaderboard mocking your mediocrity...gah).However, inevitably, the student will outclass the teacher. Super Stardust HD is that particular student., but instead of outclassing, it pounded on Geometry Wars seeral times, buried it, and urinated on its grave.My eyes hurt from the amazingness of SSHD. The controls are more responsive, the gameplay significantly faster and more frantic, and the graphics, in 1080 progressive glory, is a sight that needs to be seen. Essentially, you're a small, feeble ship thrown on apocalyptic planet grids which are constantly bombarded with a barrage of comits, mines, and heat seeking massive worms. It's like a mad world of Centipedes, Geometry Wars, and Asteroids all in one. New strategical elements in the game are found in the forms of boosts and upgradable weapons, which are subsequently effective against particular types of asteroids and enemies. You also have bombs, which give you an opportunity to gaze upon the game's magnificent explosion and particle effects, all at a consistent sixty frames a second.I won't go too far in describing the gameplay, as it's really self-explanatory. Instead, I'll dedicate my time in persuading you, the common Giant Bomb reader, to slap down a measly $19.97 ($9.99 and two $4.99 expansions) for this stunning game. The game is freaking fun, and will have you addicted. Whenever I start playing a single session of the game, it consistently escalates into a three or four hour session, with me vying for the high score and cussing at that damn red centipede (I will be avenged, you damn dirty ape!). The expansions, both solo and team, make a great experience far better. Endless mode, a new mode that is added with the Solo expansion, is possibly more enthralling than the original arcade mode, and the orchestrated soundtracks and competitive multiplay modes added through the Team expansion are epic in scale.This is a game that should not be missed. Subjectively, it's my favorite downloadable title featured across all platforms. However, at an object stance, it is still one of the most technically proficient, full-fleshed, tightly controlled experience to be found on all three platforms. Try it, you'll like it.-Dave\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Professor Layton and the Curious Village is an extremely creative and unique game. This game blends the best aspects of two recent games for the DS. The mystery/case solving aspect of Phoenix Wright and the brain stimulating games of Brain Age.  I would have never guessed that I would be so drawn into this type of game. In the two days that I have had it I have solved 70 of the 130 puzzles. I have played this game so much, usually before bed, I see puzzles when I close my eyes to sleep.  I was also surprised by the difficulty of some of the puzzles in this game. With the art style and look of the game you would think that it was targeted for children, that isn't the case. While some of the puzzles are rather easy there have been multiple times I have sat with a pad of paper trying to solve a puzzle for upwards of 10-20 minutes.  The one draw back to this game that I see is that it has almost no re-playability. Once you know the answers to the puzzles playing through it a second time would be absolutely pointless. I do plan on letting my girlfriend play it when I am done. She isn't a gamer, but I am sure she will enjoy this game.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"What do you get when you take James Bond and remove his charme and wit (and hair for that matter)? You get a dead serious, cold blooded, merciless assasian named 47. Hitman is one of (many) series where you don't really need to know the back story in order to imurse yourself into the game. The story aint bad, it just isn't the main focus of the game. The main focus is to find the best and most effective way to kill your target, and the possibilities are almost endless . It may sound grusome, but it is damn entertaining (remember all of your targets are scumbags and pretty much deserves it anyway).So alot of the time you are just walking around, trying to find a way to finnish your mission, that dosent leave any witnesses and such. Of course you can just shoot everything that moves, until you get the one you are supposed to get. But that is of course, far from as rewarding, than when you find a real clever way, to accomplish your mission, that you might not have figured out in the get go. You also get a better rating depending on how well you did it. So it is best to just take your time in each mission.The only real negative that I can find in this game (aside from some questionable AI at some times) is that the graphics could have been better. It looks alright in the gameplay, but in the cinematics it is lacking a bit. Some of the characters look very cartoonish in not a good way (especially a journalist character that has a very prominent role in most of the cinematics).But there is really not much to complain about. Most of the stuff, it gets right, and what it dosent get right, are just minor details. Defiantly a great game for the ones who dosent just want to play a straight forward game, but instead play a game that acquires you to think a bit.\\xa0 \",\n",

       "  'description': 'In 2006 (2007 for Ps3 owners), Team Rainbow stormed their way onto next gen consoles with a bang. Thousands have continued to flank each other online everyday of their lives. Now, in 2008, the year of battling Nintendo characters, and Liberty City\\'s makeover, Ubisoft Montreal has decided to let everybody have another chance at liberation in Sin City. But is this rush-job showing the signs of it, or has the dev team been able to refine the experience?  The first Vegas left players on a bit of an edge, with the twist at the end that made men scream like girls in horror. Although the narrative design leaves a bit to be desired, what is here manages to put some closure to the overall story. The storytelling in Vegas 2 doesn\\'t do the first much justice, as it is much shorter, and less deep than the previous installment. It\\'s still fairly decent, but it isn\\'t as epic as something like Call of Duty.  Actually, Vegas 2 manages to be both a prequel and a sequel. The game starts off in the French mountains, as you play as a Rainbow operative named Bishop. And your squad just so happens to be Gabriel Nowak and Logan Keller ((OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH…) (If you haven\\'t played the first, then perhaps you should ask a friend to tell you the details)) After this first mission, the game fast forwards five years into the present, in Las Vegas. As Bishop, your team must stop a terrorist organization from destroying the city. This is occuring about the same time that Logan\\'s team is in Mexico (OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH…) There is a theme of trust throughout the game, but it never gets too deep.  For anybody who doesn\\'t know, Rainbow Six Vegas 2 is a first person shooter, with a cover system that switches into a third person view. You can command two other teammates, and they eventually become crucial, and a bit of a crutch to lean on. You can stack them up against a door, and send them in by certain commands. You can also tell them where to go, who to kill first and last. It\\'s a big help that these guys are incredible marksmen, and will almost always get a headshot. Vegas 2 is a very heavy tactical shooter. Patience is really needed, because if you run out into the open, it only takes one burst of fire to bring you down.  Holding the left trigger allows you to put your back against any wall or object that you can use to take cover. You have the ability to lean out to either side, or to look over cover to shoot enemies. This works amazingly well, and is very smooth. It\\'s a main aspect of the gameplay that is easy to get used to.  However, this is a sequel. And sequels are supposed to have either a ton of new content, or be a total refinement of the previous game. Luckily, Vegas 2 is a TOTAL refinement of the original, and even happens to sneak in a little new content.  First of all, graphically, Vegas 2 is absolutely gorgeous compared to the first game. The foggy look and dull textures have all been tossed for a much more sharp, vibrant game. The character models all look much more alive in their animations, and lip syncing, although still only par, is better than before. The framerate is solid throughout, lighting is way more convincing, and the blood splattering is like a Jackson Pollack painting. Absolutely beautiful. Without a doubt, this is one of the best looking shooters out there, surprisingly running on the aging Unreal 3 Engine.  Sound quality is also enhanced. The laughably bad voice acting of the first has been thrown away for a more professional and believable outing. The voice are still very out noised by the effects, making it difficult to hear your team speak at times. It\\'s a good thing that the sound effects are excellent.  The controls are a lot smoother and quick this time around. Everything moves much faster, while still managing to keep the tactical side of things in check. Some of the button mapping has been changed, but once you get the hang of it, it\\'s well done. You can now tell you team to throw a grenade somewhere, and now with the simple act of holding down a button, you can sprint. Evading grenades is now possible, the game is quickened significantly, everybody\\'s happy.  The original\\'s crushing difficulty has been scaled back a lot. Apparently, sometime between 2006 and now, Ubisoft discovered the \"easy difficulty\". This opens the game up more to casual gamers, and the game is much more streamlined than before. Enemy AI is better than before, but in this difficulty, they aren\\'t so great at shooting.  There are some attention grabbing set pieces thrown in for good measure. There\\'s a scene where your team is outside of an arena, while the place is gassed, thousands of people are dying on the other side of the door, and you can\\'t do anything about it. You watch one of your teammates fall apart in horror. You bow your head. These are really capturing, and save the lackluster story from destruction.  Stealing a little from Call of Duty 4, you now are able to shoot through cover. Plaster, couches, sheet metal, other people. It adds to the realism of the game, and to be honest, is COD 4\\'s only rival in terms of realism and enjoyment.  The 8 hour journey takes you across all parts of Sin City, and some parts of Nevada. There\\'s no shortage of slot machines to shoot up, but there are less of them than in the original. It\\'s not really disappointing, but I must wonder \"Where\\'s Vegas?\".  Aside from the campaign, this IS a Rainbow Six game, and it has the multiplayer to back it up. There are about a dozen maps, with several different team based game modes. There\\'s traditional deathmatches, and attack and defend, but there are several other game modes that utilize the power of the team. There\\'s one where there is a leader on each team that must be escorted to an extraction point, and the team loses if he dies. The core gameplay is simply so much fun, and the server and game options are so deep, that there is more than enough here to justify its price tag.  There\\'s the new character system, called ACES. It\\'s an upgrade system, where basically, everything you do on or offline effects your stats. You no longer need to be online to achieve new badges and ranks. This is great, considering I\\'m now a higher rank in Vegas 2 than Vegas 1 already.  There\\'s also the terrorist hunt arcade mode, which you can now do with a squad, online or off. Enemies are much more evasive and smarter here, and it\\'s a great place to train.  Vegas 2 has everything going for it. Aside from the shallow story, there is so much here to make it a quality sequel. Enhanced everything, I like to call it. If you have played the first, buy this one. If you haven\\'t, buy this one. Everybody will find something to like',\n",

       "  'description': \"I have been excited for this game since I saw the trailer showing off the story\\xa0 and it was so well crafted that I knew the game would also be just as well crafted. The Darkness's story is amazing you play as a member of the Franchetti crime family who is named Jackie Estacado. On his 21st birthday he gets powers from the darkness which include a tentacle that impales enemies to a black hole that sucks in everything around it enemies or objects. So the plot basically consists of\\xa0 getting revenge on your Uncle Paulie who sends a hit out on you on your 21st birthday. The story gets better and better the more you go on. Although the ending battle kinda annoyed me because you do alot of awesome stuff in cutscenes but you don't actually play them but they still integrate it in the storyline by explaining why you can't play it. So anyone should rent the game atleast because of the story.  The gameplay is pretty good too, it dosen't really beat the story but it still is fun. You get the regular assortment of weapons in modern day shooters like pistols and AK-47's and shotguns but the aiming system is pretty good because the crosshair is only a red dot or when your dual-wielding there is two dots but there is no hud at all so it really immerses you in the experience. The game uses a rechargeable health system like Call of Duty 2 or Rainbow Six Vegas although the game is still pretty hard even on normal because it takes quite a while for it to charge it up, it explains the rechargeable health system because the darkness protects you from bullets. The darkness powers really make this game original not exactly innovative since certain things that you do you can do in other games other than the black hole and demon arm. All together though the darkness's gameplay isn't the stand out part of the game it does it's job fine. \\xa0 The graphics are amazing all of the character models are really detailed and also the enviroments are but they are pretty small. The gun models look good but I didn't really like how a pretty long line of smoke follows your gun after you shoot off a shot. The graphics though really make the game more immersive and you will spend time enjoying them because Jackie moves pretty slow. The sound is also really good, I was suprised at how good it was since the graphics were so good but all the gun sounds are good and devouring hearts sounds so brutal. The vocals are also another reason the sound is so good each person sounds authentic and the lip syncing is also awesome some people just feel real with their hand motions and such. There also is a guy who is alot like Jack Nicholson in a area called Grinders Lane.  Now theres also a multiplayer mode that is kinda fun but is really laggy but because of the variety of 2 completely different play styles since you can change from human to darkling [which are like little gremlins] in certain game modes it is kinda fun. Which are the same darkling's from the single player game and they control suprisingly well also they can climb on walls and jump a good amount of feet. The multiplayer feels really tacked on though but if they could release a update to fix the lag it could be a little bit more fun\\xa0 and\\xa0 the graphics are also the same in multiplayer as in singleplayer which is helps it a little bit.  All together though the darkness has one of the best storyline's on 360 and has pretty good gameplay to boot but the replay value isn't that good. I can't wait for The Darkness 2.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Good racers really are uncommon on this generation, which is why, although I found it very shallow and frustrating, DiRT is a breath of fresh air. It tries nothing new, and doesn't have a lot of game modes, but its graphical polish, and excellent physics do make it worth while.  Let's start off with the good, since there's a lot of it here. Graphically, DiRT is an unmatched powerhouse. The cars look absolutely incredible, and they shine absolutely perfectly in the gleaming sun, or in the soaking rain. They also show mud and dirt when they do get dirty. The tracks are all entirely destructible, and will deform as cars drive over the mud, signs will smash through windshields when run over, fences will crumble, and overall the tracks show immense detail without the slightest form of pop-in on the main road. The backgrounds also look great. Each tree has individual leaves and branches, which is an immense feat. Unfortunately, the trees do pop in as you draw near them, which isn't a big problem, but it is completely noticeable. Oddly enough, the Xbox 360 version runs miles worse than the Playstation 3 version. The Ps3 version runs constantly at 30, even during multi car races, but the 360 version will tank to about 5 or 6 during these parts, and it becomes unbearable at times. The textures and lighting are still comparable on both versions, so Xbox 360 fans don't have anything else to worry about. The extra time spent on the Ps3 version payed off, however. Overall, whichever way you look at DiRT, it does look simply incredible.  As a racer, DiRT does get the job done really well. Every car handles really well, on every track. The controls are very smooth, and simple, using the left trigger, for both reverse and brake. Acceleration is also a breeze, as most vehicles seem to be propelled by rockets. It's a very accessible racer, and is a blast to play for the most part. The variety to the tracks is pretty cool. There are straight, high speed desert courses, and there are slow, winding mountain trails. Overall, most parts are fun to play through.  The first person view is absolutely great. The dashboards look good, driver animations are realized, you can move your head, so you can see your feet, or even your co driver. Smash into a tree, and see the car door rip off, or roll your car, and watch the windshield smash, and your co driver get whiplash are all really cool, and add to the level of immersion.  But, with the good, there must come the bad.  If you have a lack of patience, then you will crash a lot. After awhile, the game begins to feel like a trial and error game. You will get 96% through a course, and then smash into a tree, and have to start the race over. The inability to fix your car in between races during an event can make you scared to reach high speeds. The way I remedied this is just settling for 3rd or 4th, instead of trying to go for it all. This is like being a real driver, considering being alive is more important than winning, but there is such a thing as too real. If you reach this point in career mode, you can turn the difficulty down if you so wish.  There's great detail that goes into a rally racer like this. The whole ordeal make you feel like you are an actual professional rally racer, which is greatly integrated into the whole feel of the game. First off, you have a co driver with you on most races, and he'll use a numeric code to tell you the track ahead. It can be tricky at first, but once you figure out the code (the lower the number, the tighter the turn), then he can be really helpful in getting through a course unscratched. Before each race, you can edit you vehicle's performance, by changing the ratios of all sorts of things, your tires, suspension, etc. It's not quite as deep as something you'd find in a full sim racer, but what's here's pretty good.  I wish the sound quality was as good as the graphical presentation. The sound isn't poor, but there's nothing that really stands out as great. Everything is pretty good, and Travis Pastrana does a great job of navigating you through the beautiful and innovative menus. The soundtrack is catchy, but the number of songs is limited.  Career mode is where you'll spend most of your time. There are 10 tiers, all with several events containing a few races. There are several kinds of races, spanning across real and original tracks across the world. There are road tracks, dirt tracks, mud courses, and my personal favorite, desert courses. You will have the chance to race on each many times. You get cash. More cash when you do good. The only thing you can buy with this cash, is new vehicles. The selection of cars is pretty good, with over 70 cars in total in the game. Each handles differently, and you'll want to get your hands on as many as you can.  The main problem with DiRT, isn't its frustrating races, but it's actually the lack of game modes and features. The customization and immersion are very deep, but aside from the 70 or so events that will take you about 15 hours to complete depending on your skill set, there isn't much else. The replays are great, as you can slow time, speed up, change camera views, and other cinematic things. The problem with this is that the game insults and teases you with the lack of being able to save the damn things. There is no split screen multiplayer, and the online is only a time trial you can do, and compare your time with other racers. There are no car on car races, and it's disappointing big time.  What IS cool about the online part of DiRT, is the time tracking. The world record is actually by somebody in the world connected to Xbox Live, or Playstation Network. It's really cool, and again adds to the immersion level, making DiRT a great online community, despite the actual multiplayer flaws.  DiRT is a more than capable racer. It's level of frustration, and lack of game modes, are outweighed by it's great immersion, graphics, and actual racing. If you have enough money for a new game, and you have a need for speed, and want something pretty to look at, then look no further than DiRT. If you have no friends, then the issues I stated probably won't bother you at all. Most people do, and that's why I didn't give it a higher score.  I do, however, love the engine DiRT is running on. Codemasters has something great on their hands, and I can't wait to see it in action again. GRID is coming this June, and I will be quick to sink my teeth into it. Codemaster's racing franchise is their flagship now, and they need to hold onto it. I'd like to see what the future has in store for it.\",\n",

Back in 1997 the story was the main attraction and that's one of the problems. I know that MGS games are very story centric but you gotta have some gameplay or else it's not a game. If you were to skip all the cutscenes and codec calls you would probably finish the game in about 3 and a half hours. Being a Metal Gear fan I already knew most of the story twists and surprises but the short-term story stuff was interesting.The gameplay reminded me alot of MGS2 and now I realize that the core gameplay didn't change much until MGS3. But this is not a bad thing the stealth action is fun and exciting. The intenseness of waiting for a guard to pass by and not even know you're there is still fun as ever. There are some sections in this game that are truly memorable and outside the box such as the fight with Psycho Mantis and the temperature sensitive key cards these parts really stand out.While there isn't as much gameplay as an average game, the total package is still great overall. \",\n",

       "  'description': 'Developed by EA, Medal of Honor Airborne is the 5 game in the series to come to the PC. Despite using the very good Unreal Engine 3 this game has “bad” written all over it, with only a handful of redeeming features. Like most of the other Medal of Honor games you once again take on the role of an American soldier. Fighting alongside your allies from the 82 Airborne you take part in various missions including the invasion of Normandy and Operation Market Garden. The first mission sets a benchmark for the game, and yet you very rarely see any improvement on this. It’s almost like the developers got bored early on, fumbled together some poorly designed maps and gave the player the exact same objectives to complete on each one, such as… blow up a tank, destroy enemy radio, blow up another tank, take out the sniper etc… It’s a shame because the Unreal Engine has a lot of potential, which has been realised to some extent in games like Gears of War and Rainbow Six Vegas. However it’s difficult to see anything new with Airborne. The games main selling point is that you parachute into every level, but even this seems like a gimmick which doesn’t serve to affect the gameplay in any way, shape or form. The idea seemed to be that by choosing your start point you could complete your objectives in any order. However due to the small size of that maps this doesn’t make the game seem any less linear. Fortunately for Airborne the actual gun play is very good. The weapons feel powerful and there is always plenty of ammo lying around. Although for the most part this is due to the stupid AI of your team mates, who seem intent on getting themselves killed as quickly as possible. Sadly this really screws over the “realism” factor as you continue to win the battle despite your allies being cut down quicker than the Amazon rainforest. In stark contrast to your allies, the enemy AI is actually reasonably good, although the occasional Nazi will decide that his weapon is better used as a baseball bat rather than a gun. Unfortunately some clown at EA thought it would be a good idea to give the Nazis telescopic X-ray vision, allowing them to both see and shoot you from about four miles away. When combined with an unfair checkpoint save system this really adds to the frustration which comes bundled with the game. At times you feel you’re trying to beat the actual game engine rather than the Nazis. Graphics wise the game is very good especially with textures and lighting. The sound is also half decent, but it’s nothing that hasn’t be heard before. It’s almost a blessing that this game is so short, six missions to be exact, meaning you should be able to complete it in around six hours. Although by the time you get to the end you’ll certainly be wanting that time back.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Capcom has finally dished out a helping of its smart-ass demon hunters to next generation platforms, this time following a fresh face with his own dark secrets. When you begin the game, you\\'ll be treated to one of the most fantastically captivating cinematics you\\'ve ever seen, depicting Kyrie (new hero Nero\\'s love interest in the game) singing a gripping ballad at the head of a church, while a tardy Nero races through an alleyway, slaying as many demons as possible on the way. The excellence on this front doesn\\'t let up through-out the entire game, however, the same cannot be said of the gameplay itself.During the opening scene of the game, you\\'ll witness the leader of church give its members a speech about Sparda, the dark knight who they worship as their god and savior. No sooner than when he gets these words out, Dante crashes the party, killing the leader in the process. The game is quickly injected into a tale of revenge, and you are tasked with the duty of finding and killing Dante any way you can.As you set off, long-time fans of the series will be pleased to know that practically nothing has changed, and you\\'ll feel right at home. Herein lies the first problem though: it feels too much like home. You\\'ll find that it can get a bit repetitive slashing the same few types of demons, especially after seeing the \"area is being blocked by some red wall\" cutscene for the 1000th time. That\\'s not to say the combat is bad by any means, because it is still really solid, and is by most means better than other games in the genre.Where the second most prominent issue lies is within the level design and game structure. Often times you\\'ll be wandering around rather bland environments not quite sure what to do, or you\\'ll find yourself backtracking far more than you\\'d ever want to. This becomes much more apparent as you are introduced to playing Dante at a point in the game, as you\\'ll mostly only get to use him to backtrack through levels you\\'ve already completed with Nero. Were there some serious time constraints over at Capcom? Sometimes your destinations can be somewhat unclear as well, and you might find yourself wandering around for a good while before figuring out where you\\'re supposed to go. I did, and trust me it\\'s not very fun.Speaking of Dante, he is far more fun and versatile to play than Nero. It makes you wonder why they didn\\'t just create a story exclusively around him in the first place. Okay, to be fair, Dante is far too snarky to drive anything resembling a sensitive storyline, but that eludes the point. When playing Dante, you\\'re treated to various different fighting styles and weapons selectable on the fly from both the d-pad and triggers respectively. When playing Nero, you\\'re stuck with the one sword and one set of pistols, yet he has a few more tricks up his sleeve, including his Devil Bringer arm, which can grab enemies from afar and do all sorts of nasty melee moves to them. This can be very useful, but also feels a bit broken in some respects.Probably the most fun to be had in the game, besides gawking at the incredibly choreographed cutscenes, is fighting bosses. It\\'s a good thing too, because you\\'ll be fighting the same ones over and over again. I did notice that the bosses were much easier with Dante however, because his arsenal of weapons and tricks far outweigh even the handy Devil Bringer that Nero packs. You\\'ll fight various formidable foes (including the towering flame boss Berial as shown above), as well occasionally getting introduced to some humorous villains. It\\'s worth noting that there are quite a few chuckles to be had during the pre-battle banters.The visual presentation of the game is top notch as far as console action games go. You\\'ll fight towering bosses and face dozens of enemies without seeing the game slow down from its solid 60 frames per second. It\\'s all quite impressive to see pulled off, but you\\'re not going to have an eye orgasm in result. As for the audio side of things, the voice actors do their job well to get you interested in matters at hand. I would like to point out though, that the way Kyrie is pronounced got on my nerves after a while (they pronounce it something like kitty-ay.)Finishing the main storyline in the game will take you anywhere from around 8-10 hours to do, although it might feel longer due to the inhumane amount of backtracking and replaying you\\'ll be forced into. There are some reasons to come back to the game, and again, fans of the series will know about what to expect here, being basically the same reasons as always. There are multiple unlockable difficulties including the infamous Heaven or Hell mode where all enemies and yourself die in one hit, there\\'s the Bloody Palace, which basically acts as an extreme endurance test throwing waves of enemies at you, and of course there\\'s the goal of raising your mission ranks and maxing out your characters weapons and abilities.Speaking of which, I\\'d like to touch on the shop and upgrade system, because it pisses me off. After each mission, you may spend any red orbs you\\'ve earned within missions on items, and any proud souls you\\'ve recieved for completing missions on upgrades and abilities. The problem with all of this is attributed to the store\\'s pricing model. You are shown supposedly the exact price for each item you can buy, but every time you buy something, the prices go up a seemingly random amount. This is incredibly annoying when it comes to getting abilities that have multiple stages, since when you buy one of them, the rest skyrocket in price, making you unable to purchase them. Why bother showing me how much they cost if I can\\'t have them at that price. I know this is nothing new to the franchise, but why must this happen? The fact that this also applies to health and other recover items makes it even more sadistic. Obviously if the game is busting a person\\'s balls, preventing them from recieving aid is not encouraging. To make matters worse, this price hike is irreversable.I can\\'t quite put my finger on what to think of this game. There were times that I seriously did not want to continue playing (due to the backtracking, level design and puzzles), and there were other times where I was having a blast (mostly when playing as Dante and executing \"Smokin\\' Sick Style\" combos). There are times when you don\\'t quite understand what you\\'re doing, and other times when you don\\'t quite care because you\\'re busting some skulls (and it feels so good). If you\\'re a Devil May Cry fanatic, you should already own this game. For everyone else, give it a rent.',\n",

NOw as the assassin altier you go on these missions and pick pocket ease drop and visit your local assassins bural to get info then you get to climb high points to lean the area alot better then you go and watch your target do something stupid and sneak around him and kill him and escape from the city on hore back.thats bassicly all mission in the game and it gets realy boring you can go horse back but its boring you can walk around killing gards and do prety cool looking combat moves in the game you can alos climb buldings and leap of them to others and hide in some hay and blend with some monks t oalert the gards away and its so repditvie it just takes away the whole expreince and its rather lame..so overall the value is terrible the gameplay is absolutly terrible and boring and ign called this game one of the top 5 dissapointments and i couldn't agree less its absolutly broking the sound 9the graphics 9the gameplay 3the value 1the story 5overall 4.0 \",\n",

       "  'description': 'In Army of Two, you and a friend (or an AI buddy) take on the role of high risk, high reward soldiers Elliot Salem and Tyson Rios. You start out in the game as enlisted men, but quickly jettison your positions in favor of joining the SSC private military corporation. Going from two ordinary soldiers to two money hungry die-hards in nothing flat, Salem and Rios are assigned reconnaissance and assassination missions in response to the 9/11 terror attacks. There are a few twists and turns along the way, but this isn\\'t a storyline you\\'ll be talking about for long. In fact, it\\'s doubtful you\\'ll really care at all.The main gameplay in the game is focused from the ground up on the idea that you\\'re a team, and you must act accordingly. Running out guns a-blazing in nearly any situation will have you taking a dirtnap, even on the games lowest difficulty setting, Recruit. Instead, the game provides a shared meter that both players must utilize called the Aggro Meter. Derived from massively multiplayer online game monster patterns, this bar will show which player the enemies are actively pursuing, and which the enemies are ignoring. When you are being focused on, your character will be glowing bright red, as to take the attention off your teammate. Meanwhile, your buddy will become invisible to the enemy and will be able to sneak up and wreak havoc on any unsuspecting foes.Things aren\\'t all cherries and gumdrops with this system, however, and that\\'s partially due to the games button layout. Often times as the stealth character, you\\'ll find yourself shooting the enemy rather than meleeing, because both actions share the same button. This is a design choice I just can\\'t understand. There are plenty of buttons on the controller, so there\\'s no excuse. In the event that you find yourself victim of this issue, you\\'ll discover that the games shooting and aiming system is not at all meant for close quarters combat.So as you find you and your partner frequently raising the bar left and right in turn, you\\'ll be prompted to activate the games Overkill mode. This mode grants you unlimited ammo and removes the need to reload your weapon. This can be pretty cool if you\\'re the stealth guy, but the targeted one will sometimes find this harming them more than it helps, because it disables crouching behind cover. You really need to coordinate to use this well, or you\\'ll find yourself dying a bit like myself.Scattered throughout the game are these cooperative progression moments that are at first pretty cool, but soon feel tacked on and irritating. These actions include kicking a door open together, helping your teammate up a high ledge, pulling a lever, and just about anything short of holding your buddy\\'s hand while he walks. These segments add to the charm at some points, but at other times it\\'s way too overused, and will have you sighing at each instance they show up. There\\'s a section in the game where you have to watch Salem and Rios open up a busted garage door about 6 times in a row within a few minutes. Please go easy on these types of things if you make a sequel, EA. This reminds me of developers of early Wii and DS games that tacked on motion or touch controls for no good reason, and basically ruined their games.During missions, you\\'ll be prompted if you wish to enter mid-mission shopping or not, and you\\'ll find yourself selecting yes for the majority of the game. There are tons of weapons to choose from, including the AK47, the AUG, and other renamed versions of popular weapons like the M4 or the G36C. There are plenty of pistols and sub-machine guns at your disposal that you can equip as a secondary weapon for your character, but I found that most of these are pretty useless. Pistols can take out some dudes fairly quickly, but you\\'ll have to put forth twice the effort to get them to work effectively. Oddly enough though, despite the plethora of weapons at your disposal, I found myself using the same weapon I started the game with, the AK47, through 90% of entire game, because it felt the most competent.Within the shop, there are plenty of ways to customize your gear as well, but most of them are throw aways, serving no other purpose but a level 1, 2, or 3 upgrade. You can change the barrel, the silencer, the ammo container, and the stock on most weapons, and you can also \"pimp\" your gun. This basically blings out your weapon all crazy like, such as plating it with gold, or encrusting it with diamonds. There\\'s no real purpose to this outside of drawing more aggro to your character. Apparently the terrorists get jealous at your success and want to shoot you more sincerely.You\\'ll find that the shooting in the game mostly feels pretty good, but there are a few gripes with it. The first and foremost being the fact that outside of the sniper rifles, there is no way too zoom in with your gun. This can be a problem because the game likes to pit you a fair distance away from your targets, and it can feel like you\\'re shooting dots on the screen that are constantly bobbing in and out of cover. The other problem being that it takes far too long to actually take an enemy down. Unless you\\'re landing headshots, a lot of ammo is going to be wasted throughout the course of the game.Breaking up the standard action in the game are a few special sections sprinkled throughout. There are times you\\'ll be guiding a parachute while your teammate snipes, and also times where you\\'ll have to \"co-op snipe\" a target. There are also these nifty segments where Rios and Salem go back to back. During these, the game goes into a slow, almost bullet time mode, where you unload on guys with an unlimited ammo clip.There are a few \"wow\" moments within the game, mostly due to the games terrific graphics engine. Plenty of high dynamic range lighting, beautiful water, and a rock solid framerate to back it all up round out the games visuals. It\\'s too bad that the graphics are about all that sticks out when thinking of memorable moments in the game though. The sound isn\\'t much to squawk about either. From the cheesy dialog to the disappointing sounding weaponry, there\\'s not a whole lot to love here.So yeah, for the most part, you\\'re hiding behind cover and shooting the same few enemies again and again. It\\'s a shooter, yes, but perhaps if the game had a story you cared at all about, this would become less noticeable. The game actually started to feel a bit tedious 2/3 through the game, which is kind of sad considering the game lasts you only 6 hours before you see the credits roll. As for the multiplayer side of things to extend this, I was actually unable to get into a match that wasn\\'t a total lag fest. I\\'m not quite sure if the servers were having problems, or if it was the game\\'s fault, but it wasn\\'t running at a playable rate at the time.Overall, Army of Two is a decent game, but I definitely cannot approve of a full price purchase. It might be an amusing title to play through in a weekend with one of your buddies, but there simply is not enough content to dive into. Not only is the campaign short, but there are only 4 competitive multiplayer maps, and a complete lack of any deathmatch mode. Also, if you don\\'t plan on playing with other actual human beings, I cannot recommend picking up the game at all, honestly. The AI simply isn\\'t smart enough to be your trusted wingman, and you\\'ll be missing out on the fun completely.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Motorstorm is a hard game to review. On one hand it\\'s full of great graphics, and fun gameplay. On the other it lacks features that many of us have come to expect in our racing games. Despite this I still can find a lot to have fun with.  Motorstorm is first and foremost an action game. It has some simulation elements, but for the most part its a what-if game. What if you could take a huge semi truck race it against a small motorbike in huge mud filled environments? Motorstorm answers this in what is probably the best aspect of the game. The combination of bikes, ATVs, buggy\\'s, trucks, rally cars, and semi\\'s really adds a layer of strategy and depth that no other racing game has. The tracks are littered with multiple paths. Different vehicles run better on different paths. It\\'s up to you to choose the best vehicle for each path. The controls are tight and the wrecks are great.  To help with all this chaos Motorstorm has sublime graphics. While at first glance they may not seem too amazing after a run around the tracks you really get the sense of the tech behind the game. You can see cars all the way off into the distance. The grooves in the dirt and mud created by a dozen vehicles racing around is impressive, and the destruction of your vehicle is probably the best seen on any console currently. The game runs at a very steady 30fps and hardly if ever slows down. The only hickups occur on the main menu. For some reason the background video likes to skip a lot. I suppose it could be my copy.  Sound is good enough. I prefer to turn off the music so I can hear the crash effects and cars coming up behind me. After awhile of playing however you will start to go crazy after hearing that same turbo boost sound turning off and on.  Where Motorstorm truly shines is online. Playing against really people and trash talking your foes is what a game like this requires. It\\'s amazing that all of this crazy action is completely lag free. Sadly the online features are lacking which brings us to the problems with Motorstorm.  Offline you have one mode. It\\'s a race mode called \"Festival Mode.\" It consists of multiple races in which you are given a vehicle and track and have to race the AI to unlock more races and vehicles. It\\'s repetitive and gets old pretty quick. The problem is that every race is the same. It\\'s all a typical finishing first race. You can\\'t even play a mode where you choose your own vehicle, tack, number of laps, A.I opponent number etc. The lack of 2-player splitscreen is sad, but not a huge letdown when compared to the lack of singleplayer modes and features. The saving grace of online play even is lacking some basic features. The online lobby is terrible and the ranking system is as bare boned as they get, and some small features like being able to see what car your opponents have chosen is missing.  Despite all of this Motorstorm is very fun. The graphics are amazing, gameplay is top-notch, and the online play makes it all worthwhile. If you have a PS3 this is one of those games that should be on your shelf.  PROS + Amazing graphics and tech + Great fun gameplay + Great design on tracks + Online play is lag free and fun  CONS - Complete lack of single/multiplayer modes and features - Vehicle stats? - Vehicles take forever to load - Online Lobby is lacking - Where is that damn inside the car view!!!',\n",

       " {'deck': \"Assassin's Creed (X360) - Review by Kim Fidler\",\n",
       "  'description': 'When I was younger, I always wanted to be an assassin. For some reason, the thought of sneaking around in shadows and getting the drop on a drug lord always seemed to appeal to me. When I first heard about Assassin’s Creed, I immediately thought that my dreams were going to become a reality. With large sweeping cities to use as my playground, I imagined leaping from high buildings into a packed market while being chased by my pursuers. In a way, my dreams came true, but that doesn’t mean that everything was great from start to finish.The story in Assassin’s Creed focuses on taking down a group of men that are jointly working towards a much larger goal. With each assassination you learn a little more about the reasoning behind it all, but never is there a time where you think you absolutely have it all figured out. The story is represented to the player in memory blocks which are basically just that. Blocks of a memory being repeated back in order to solve the puzzle. Why are they memories? Well, I’m not going to give that away. Overall the story is presented in a very mature and cinematic way that will satisfy even the most judgemental gamers.The first thing you will notice about Assassin’s Creed is simply how beautiful it looks. If you’re playing it on an HD television set, you’ll be treated to high-definition in all its glory. Sadly, the game doesn’t really seem to stand up on a standard tube set as it’s going to be cutting off much of the HUD at the sides. Other than that, the graphics hook you from the very first time you climb a building in order to synchronize yourself with your surroundings. The character models and movement are pretty spot on, although you do tend to run into the odd glitches when dispatching adversaries. A great showcase if you have a home theatre you want to show off to all your friends.In terms of sound quality, voice acting is where Assassin’s Creed truly shines. From Altair’s sarcastic droll to the accents of all the nationalities, the team over a Ubisoft hit it right on. Not once did I cringe from uncomfortable scripting and with so many lines of dialogue I would consider that a huge accomplishment. The soundtrack suit’s the style of title and it never feels forced into areas of gameplay that it doesn’t belong. The only complaint I have about the sound is how annoying they made the homeless people, but that could be attributed to the fact that homeless people in fact are pretty annoying.Perhaps the biggest flaw in Assassin’s Creed is what I feel is one of the most important factors in any title. The lasting appeal of what you’re given to do in the game just doesn’t really hold anyone’s attention for too long. While the assassination investigations are great fun, you’ll quickly find yourself getting tired of completing all of the extra objectives they throw at you. In a city you have a handful of things to do and when you move onto a new part of a city, you get to do the same things all over again. A little repetitive, but definitely not needed to progress through the game. In other words, if you want to play through the story you can probably do it in a day, where as if you wanted to complete the game to 100% completion, you’ll be spending a lot more time doing the same thing over and over.Your mileage may vary when it comes to Assassin’s Creed. It’s an extremely polished and fun title for those that simply enjoy running around and completing the assassinations, but a letdown for those that are expecting a middle eastern GTA. If you go into Assassin’s Creed, play an hour or two every couple of days, you’ll have a better experience than those that try squeezing every little bit of the gameplay out of the game in an afternoon. I enjoyed it and even though I can’t recommend it as a buy for everyone, I do recommend that everyone give it a shot.Kim Fidler',\n",

       " {'deck': \"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas 2 - Review by Kim Fidler\",\n",
       "  'description': ' Up until the day “Rainbow Six Vegas 2” was released, I had a group of friends that still played the original on a daily basis. Each one making bold claims that not only was it superior to the online offerings of other top FPS titles, but it was probably the best online game of all time. To say the least, I was sceptical. Saying that it’s better than Call of Duty 4, I can understand, people have their own opinion on what they find enjoyable in an FPS. However, saying that it’s best online game ever? I don’t know about that. This is something I would have to see for myself.When I initially heard that Rainbow Six Vegas 2 was getting released, I was excited. I never had any intention of picking up Vegas 1, but with a sequel out on the market, I felt it was a great time to cut my teeth on Tom Clancy’s Vegas adventure. It’s always nice to get in on the action right from the release of a game, but with RSV2, I really didn’t know what I was getting into. A single player story that directly continues from the first title, and a multiplayer that plays exactly the same way as its first time out. Not a bad thing, but a little daunting for those of us just being introduced to the series.The first thing I decided to take on in Rainbow Six Vegas 2 was the single player mission. Being the type of gamer I am, I slapped it on the “Normal” difficulty and thought that it’d be a breeze to walk through the game in one sitting. Prior to playing RSV2, I had heard horror stories about the difficulty of many Tom Clancy titles. While the Vegas series is a little more lenient, playing through on normal is akin to what many titles would feel like on their hard setting. If you aren’t a huge FPS player, it pains me, but you might actually want to try playing through the game on casual before taking on the harder difficulties.The single player story mode gives you two AI characters that will basically do whatever you want them to do. Such as take point and drop any enemies they happen to run into, hang back and shoot enemies from behind cover, and above all, clear out rooms that you’re a little wary about going into. Your companions can and often will do many stupid things, but it seems that they tend to stick to what they know and they’re a welcome addition to helping you clear out the levels.The story missions don’t take much commitment to get through, but the only complaint I had was that I had absolutely no clue as to what was going on. You play the role of Bishop, a grizzled veteran of the Rainbow Six team, as he assists and guides the story that initially was played in the original game. That is all I really understood about the story, and sadly, I never felt the connection with the characters that I did with a game like “Call of Duty 4.” Other than that, it was a great learning process that not only does a great job of introducing you to the gameplay of the Vegas series, but does a decent job of nudging you out of that run and gun attitude many of us have adopted from other titles.As you play through the single player, you will notice numbers popping up at the bottom of your screen. Those numbers relate to one of the best new features introduced in RSV2, the ACES system. The ACES system is borrowed heavily from what COD4 started with their experience system. ACES rewards people for scoring kills in certain ways, and with those kill points, you’re awarded with new guns, more experience, and new clothing for outfitting your character. It works great but there really isn’t enough levels in the system to keep the rewards flowing up until your Elite rank level. Fans of the series will also be happy to hear that experience points can also be gained in the Story Mode, and Terrorist Hunt Mode. Meaning that you no longer have to play thousands of multiplayer games to keep the experience points coming.The character customization also returns in RSV2, but not only is it available in multiplayer, but it is available in the Story Mode. Not a crazy addition, but it’s nice to be able to play your own character throughout the campaign. Speaking of the character creation system, it’s back and expanded to include more items, more weapons, and more camo colors to satisfy everyone. They also decided to bring back the ability to use your Live Eye Camera to put yourself in the game. I’ve tried numerous times to get it to work but every single time it looks like someone is trying to asphyxiate me with a plastic bag. Nice function but you can tell that lighting is a huge factor on making it look good.While the Story Mode is decent, it’s not the reason most people decided to lay down the cash for Rainbow Six Vegas 2. The multiplayer was the main draw of Vegas 1, and with Vegas 2, the trend continues. With more online modes than the original, Vegas 2 expands on what people loved, and fixed most of the little quirks that people didn’t enjoy. Having not played the first title, I really didn’t know what I was getting into, or if I’d actually be able to hang with the people that had been playing for years. Well, I was surprised in some good and some bad ways.My initial impressions of RSV2s multiplayer was that it was much slower than what I was used to. No longer was running around and blasting people rewarded with points, but instead it was rewarded with a headshot and respawn. It took a little getting used to, but after about five hours of online play, I began to get the hang of sneaking around and being patient for my kills. Trust me, I died a lot and quickly realized that the types of people that play RSV2 online are much more thorough in how they dispatch you. One of the great things about Rainbow 2’s multiplayer is the sheer amount of maps and game types that you have available to you. There are tons of maps from Vegas 1, as well as the new maps from Vegas 2. With those maps you also have a bunch of modes to occupy yourself with. The nicest thing about the variety is being able to change what you’re playing at any given time, and feeling almost like you’re playing a different game altogether. I tend to radiate more towards Deathmatch style modes, but every once in awhile it is nice to change over to an objective based map.The Terrorist Hunt mode that was insanely popular in Vegas 1 returns and does it better than before. The Terrorist Hunt mode is best described as a bunch of terrorists are thrown into a level, and you (and up to 3 of your friends) are in charge of taking them out. I have probably put more time in Terrorist Hunt than any other mode, just because it’s great to play a really fun, polished co-op mode where you can relax and just chat with your friends. It does get a little stressful when you can’t die and there’s 2 terrorists sneaking around, but other than that you can sit back, kick up your feet and relax while enjoying a non-competitive online game.The only complaints I have with the multiplayer is how the interface feels archaic and dated. How a game can come out without a party system, is beyond me. I’m told that it’s pretty much the same system from Vegas 1, which really wasn’t that great to begin with. For example, when you play a ranked match, you get into the game and when it finishes you’re booted back to the main menu. Not a screen that will allow you quickly join another ranked game, but the main menu where you choose what mode you want to play. It only relates to ranked games, thankfully player matches are handled in a much easier to navigate system.Up to writing this, I have probably put about 30 hours into the various online modes of Rainbow Six Vegas 2. I have played a handful of levels of the Story mode in Co-Op, most of the maps on Terrorist Hunt, and tons of adversarial Versus games. The nicest part about it, is that I keep coming back for more. This is one title that I will keep coming back to just because the online components are so fun and addicting.While my friends are now claiming that Rainbow Six Vegas 2 is the best thing on the planet, I would agree but on a smaller scale. I wouldn’t rate Rainbow Six Vegas 2 as the best online game ever, but I will say that it should be in every Xbox 360 owners’ library. Not only does it have a solid single player, but it has one of the best multiplayer components of any title I have ever played. I would go so far as to say that if you own Rainbow Six Vegas 2, Halo 3, and Call of Duty 4, you would be set for years when it comes to online play. There are some issues that could have been worked on, but overall Vegas 2 is a great package that should tide the masses over until the next instalment in the series.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Before Nintendo first revealed anything on Phantom Hourglass, there was no Zelda game for one of Nintendo\\'s greatest systems: the Nintendo DS, and most people thought it was going to be an online Four Swords type game, but everyone was wrong. Nintendo then announced, out of nowhere, The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass and right away, people knew it was going to be epic. Mixing the old birds-eye look of the 2D Zelda games from the past, and the new 3D cartoon style, people wanted to see more and more of this going-to-be epic game. As you all have noticed though, Nintendo has gone \\'casual\\', and now most of their games are getting stupidly easy (Twilight Princess) and are getting ridiculously simple (Wii Sports). And everyone knows also knows the Nintendo DS is not a graphical powerhouse, so Nintendo decided to go with the more \\'cartoony\\' look, made famous in the Wind Waker for the Gamecube. With this new casual approach, Nintendo decided to again, make the game simple, and make it easy. Nintendo went for an all touch game, which means everything is controlled with the touch screen, even running and slashing, all. Most people thought this would ruin the game, and old school Zelda fans would be turned off by such a move. But what Nintendo has done is nothing short of outstanding. The touch controls work near-perfect, the graphics are amazing, the adventure is epic.\\xa0The game starts off right after the events of the Wind Waker, literally. Link, Tetra, and the pirate crew are all on the ship sailing the seas. After a cute slide show of the events of the Wind Waker, fog randomly rolls around the ship, and the mysterious and well-known but never seen Ghost Ship appears out of nowhere. The courageous girl Tetra is, leaps on the ship to try and see what the hell is going on. But right after she does so, \"Ahhh!\", she screams aloud. Link jumps to her aid only to fall off the ship and get washed away. Afterwards, Link wakes up on a random island in the middle of nowhere, not knowing where he is. Stuff happens here, stuff happens there, and eventually you meet up with a mysterious man named Lineback who controls the ship you must travel with during the game. You eventually find out that Bellum is the one behind Tetra\\'s capture, and you must save her before it\\'s too late. So it\\'s your job to travel around the seas, like in the Wind Waker, and try to find out more about the Ghost Ship, and more importantly, save Tetra.\\xa0The game plays amazing, everything from talking, to running, to using the boomerang is used with the stylus. Like in Animal Crossing Wild Worlds, you touch the part of the screen where you want to run, but unlike Animal Crossing, Link zips, and it feels more smooth and can actually feel better than using the buttons. To use your sword, you slash in the direction you want to slash, simple. And if you want to do a 360 spin attack, you quickly draw around Link and he\\'ll do it. You can also tap the enemy you want to attack, and Link will do a jumping slice if he\\'s too far away, or he\\'ll do a normal slash if you\\'re close enough. Most enemies are pretty easy to defeat, either one or two slashes will usually kill them off. But combat, even though easy, is actually quite satisfying. Nintendo couldn\\'t have done it any better, and it works great. Rolling is the only think that bugs me about the touch only controls. While running, you have to make a small circle and Link will roll. It\\'s not as easy as it sounds though, because sometimes it just doesn\\'t work, no matter what you do. This is especially annoying when you\\'re trying to roll into a tree to get items. Picking up items is also easy, you touch the item you want to pick up, and he\\'ll pick it up. Then, you can press the direction you want to throw it, and he\\'ll throw it there as well.\\xa0Most of Link\\'s equipment are amazingly used too. To use the boomerang for example, is as easy as drawing the path of where you want it to go, and it will follow exactly where you draw. In the dungeons, which there are plenty of, you will have to use these items like you never have before. I don\\'t want to give away too much spoilers, so I\\'ll try and tone it down a bit, but I could talk all day about how cleverly these items are used. Another example is the grappling rope, which you can hook it on a post sticking into the ground, and pull yourself towards it. You can also put the grappling rope onto two posts at the same time and walk on it, like a tight rope. Plus, you can use the rope as a sling shot to shot yourself from, and even to reflect your arrows. Equipping you items can be a pain though because when you go to the menu, the game is not paused, so enemies can still attack you, and it can be really tiring when you need an item for certain enemy, but they keep attacking you. The menu is activated by the touch screen at the bottom right, and the bottom left. The left menu is where you can save your game, and the right one is where you change your items. It can also get quite irritating when you want to run southwest or southeast, but you push the menu buttons. Also, when you\\'re carrying items and you want to walk a certain direction, he will throw the item in that direction first, then run there.\\xa0One main part of the game is the Temple of the Ocean Kings, where you go deeper and deeper into after every completed dungeon in order to find different sea charts. I\\'ll talk about the temple later on. Sea Charts unlock certain areas of the sea. There are 4 main areas of the season, and there are many islands on each part of the area. To travel to the different parts of the sea, you must ride Lineback\\'s ship, which is way easier to use than Link\\'s King of Red Lions in the Wind Waker. What you do is draw a line, and your ship will follow where you drew. And while traveling there, you can turn left and right by pressing that part of the screen, and you can also jump by pressing the jump button at the bottom of the screen. Enemies pop up everywhere while sailing, and you can attack them by shooting them with your cannon. It\\'s as simple as touching the enemy you want to shoot. You also have unlimited ammo, unlike the Wind Waker where you have to use bombs. You can also get jumped by a Female Pirate, and when she ambushes you, you must fight here inside you ship. This event can happen every so often, and can actually be quite fun to try and dodge her.\\xa0But the Temple of the Ocean Kings is a cool temple, and a very cool concept, but can get tiresome after a while. What you must do is travel from floor to floor looking for sea charts. After you find the sea chart, you can exit, and travel to that part of the sea. But after to beat the temple, and obtain some Sand of Time, you must go back, and look for another sea chart. Oh, and by the way, you\\'re timed, and you run out when you step out of a safe area. There are also Phantom Guards that patrol the temple, and on the map on the top screen, it shows the way they\\'re looking, kind of like guards in Metal Gear Solid. Phantom Guards cannot be killed though, so you must dodge them in order to proceed through the temple. The Temple of the Ocean Kings is a cool concept like I said before, but each time you come back to the temple, you have to do the same puzzles you did before over and over again. Eventually, you can travel halfway through so you don\\'t have to travel there again, but it\\'s still tiring in the first couple of hours.\\xa0The graphics are especially amazing in this game. What the Wind Waker made famous, Phantom Hourglass put on the DS. But, it\\'s no doubt a huge downgrade from the Gamecube, but Phantom Hourglass is definitely the best looking DS game to date, maybe even better than some Nintendo 64 games. Everything is cel-shaded in the game, from the character models to the environments, and it looks great. They\\'re easy on the eyes, and never get bothersome in any way. Not everything looks perfect though, pots, rocks, and other things you can pick up are sprites, and aren\\'t actually in 3D. It\\'s nothing to get angry over, but it sometimes can look odd when Link pick up pot that doesn\\'t look 3D, but everything else does. The enemies are smartly designed too, but there isn\\'t a huge variety. There are the main Octoroks, Chu-Chus, and Miniblins. But there are also new enemies like a huge fish-like creature that has a sword and a shield. The bosses are also quite amazing. Each one is unique to the temple they reside in. One, for example, is a flying Octorok, and it resides in the Sky Temple.\\xa0The audio is also quite magnificent in Phantom Hourglass. The soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks in a handheld Zelda game, but it\\'s definitely not perfect. There are great tunes, like the island tune, but the music seems to be constant, and never changes. For example, every dungeon has the same music, and every island has the same music. Usually in Zelda games every dungeon has a different tune, and the different towns have different music. It\\'s only a minor gripe, but it can get irritating. But everything else is pretty much perfect though. Each sound effect sounds exactly like the Wind Waker counterpart. Link\\'s yell, perfect. Everything sounds great.\\xa0The main quest will probably take you around 15 to 20 hours, and that\\'s pretty good for a DS game. You can collect different parts for you ship by searching the sea. This is done by finding a treasure chart, and it marks an X on your map. From there, you stop on the X and fish in the sea for treasure. Using the crane in Phantom Hourglass is a lot better than using the Grapping Hook in the Wind Waker. Once you start, you must play a mini game where you slide the crane left and right dodging enemies and things in the way. One you get to the bottom, you pick up the treasure, and you have to bring it back to the top passes all of the things you dodged getting to the bottom. You can also speed the crane up, and slow it down just in case you don\\'t want to damage it. If you do damage the crane, you must to back to the man that made it for you, and buy a new one. Another distraction from the main quest is the battle mini game that you can even play online. Yes, Phantom Hourglass is the first competitive multi-player Zelda game. Not only is it not that fun though, it\\'s not even a minor distraction. The mini game is a Link vs. Phantom capture the flag type of game where players rotate from being Link and being the Phantom. What you must do as Link is dodge the Phantoms and grab as many Triforce pieces as possible and deliver them back to your zone. As a Phantom, you must draw a line on the touch screen to where you want the Phantoms to go. You can keep your overall stats like wins, losses, and disconnections.\\xa0Overall, Phantom Hourglass is a true Zelda game, easy or not. There are many major things that make it an amazing game like the near-perfect controls, the great boss battles, and the amazing puzzles. There are also many little things that make it great like drawing on maps, which is really useful, and the great usage of equipment. There are also many gripes though, like the rolling, the Temple of the Ocean Kings, and some of the music. But overall, Phantom Hourglass is a great overall package, and is no doubt the best DS game to ever hit the market. You can put it beside Ocarina of Time, A Link to the Past, and the Wind Waker, because Phantom Hourglass is a great game, and shouldn\\'t be passed by anyone.\\xa0',\n",

       "  'description': \"This game is amazing. Now that I got that out of the way, let me explain why. On the surface, it's simple: stop at a stoplight and perform in one of five events to gain new cars and better, yet still creased, licenses. But underneath is a daunting level of complexity and the scale of the game is really very frightening. There are Superjumps, which are special ramps that activate beautiful cinematic camera angles and can result in some daunting crashes, which I will talk about more later, Billboards to smash, and shortcuts that can give you an edge in winning a race or staying alive in the 'get to the finish without eating it' event Marked Man. Then there are the crashes. I found myself boosting into walls just to see the bone crunching crashes that look incredible. The car models look amazing and they seemed to have put in a new level of car damage models that looks utterly stunning as the hood folds in on itself, the bumpers fall off, and other lunacy occurs.This is no gran turismo. It is an arcade racing game at it['s core. It's sort of like chess with really good looking cars, easy to pick up and play, but extremely difficult to master, It has it's problems and might not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you're into a game that seems like it belongs next to a Mortal Kombat machine in an arcade, this could be your game.\",\n",

Everything seems like it came straight out of a Pixar movie. Character classes (of which there are 9) are all very distinct and have their own funny and quirky personalities. This new humorous tone is carried over into every aspect of the game.TF2's style is the only reason it is amazing though. It's gameplay is incredibly addictive. The game is perfectly balanced. Every class has a role whether it's gibbing annoying scouts with rockets, healing your teammates, or building sentries that make enemies quake in their boots. No class ever feels left out. The actual killing is also extremely satifying with guts and blood exploding with every death. It has an unbelievable level of polish too.Valve is continuing to release more content for Team Fortress 2 constantly including new maps, new weapons, and more achievements.

       " {'deck': 'Dead Rising (X360) - Review by Kim Fidler',\n",
       "  'description': ' Every console generation always seems to have a title that is misunderstood. It has all the elements that makes a game great, yet it attempts something new that many who play just don’t seem to understand. When Dead Rising was released in 2006, it was praised as a title that tried to revolutionize the standard formula of open world games, while at the same time it was also criticized for its unforgiving real-time aspects. Described by Keiji Inafune, the game’s creator, as a throwback to the old school arcade cabinets from the 80s, it set out to reward those who stuck with the game and punish those who expected to have their hands held through the experience. Is it an enjoyable experience or does it come down to a frustrating test of patience?Dead Rising, is essentially, a videogame companion to Dawn of the Dead. Even though a disclaimer exists to legally cover Sega from court room retribution, it’s influenced directly from the George Romero classic in a way that even the most diehard zombie fan can appreciate. It has hordes of zombies, it has a mall, and it has enough gore to make anyone squirm in their seat. What Dead Rising also borrowed from Dawn of the Dead is the very apparent backdrop of how us humans tend to react in dire situations. How many cower in fear, while some rise up to fight back, and how a certain few tend to take advantage of the situation for personal gain. While at its core it’s still a videogame, it tends to say many things without really saying anything at all.The gameplay in Dead Rising is what many of us have come to expect from an open world style game. The player is given the ability to explore the environment, and with that exploration, is rewarded with perks that eventually will make the game much more enjoyable. When you first boot up Dead Rising, you may be a little confused. The game utilizes a levelling system, but doesn’t exactly tell you that in order to progress through the game it is almost essential to level up. At level 1, the main character Frank, is about as useless as the hostages he’ll eventually be rescuing. As he gains levels Frank will be rewarded with more health, more speed, and many maneuvers that will make traversing the mall much more fun.Accompanying the levelling system, is the mechanic that Dead Rising uses in order to progress the game’s main storyline. From the moment you enter the mall, you have 72 hours of in-game time in order to accomplish all that you need to do. Whether that is investigate what caused the zombie outbreak, or rescue hostages, you will need to make sure that you are being as efficient as possible. What is frustrating about this mechanic for many is that if you are not working totally towards your goal, there is a good chance that you’re going to miss something important. This is where the multiple play through aspect of Dead Rising comes in. At any point during the game, you can save your game and choose whether or not you’d like to continue or start a new game at your current level. The player is given 1 save slot and with that slot you have to go into each run-through of Dead Rising with a set goal in mind. This, along with the levelling system is where many players became frustrated with the game. Instead of being able to accomplish everything in 1 run of the game, you will have to instead split up your goals into multiple runs and complete them separately. It’s a new mechanic that works for those of us who like to get everything out of a title, but a nightmare for gamers that like to play a game once and be done with it.Although it was released 2 years ago, I personally feel the graphics of Dead Rising are still some of the best on the Xbox 360 to date. The character models actually look like humans, and even though some of them can at times move around like robots, they still get around realistically enough. In a game with so many zombies, you would expect to see an overlap of zombie models, but thankfully the zombie types are never repetitive to the point of distraction. What I found to be the most impressive about the game is how at any given time, you could have a hundred zombies on the screen without a hint of slowdown or stutter. Considering there are games that struggle with keeping a dozen on the screen, it’s a nice change to see framerate optimization done right. Dead Rising also has the advantage of being one of the few Capcom games that wasn’t completed butchered in terms of voice acting. Although some of the hostages can be a little over the top, many of the main characters sound good and deliver their lines in the tone that they’re suppose to be delivered in. The zombies sound exactly how I would expect zombies to sound, but be warned, someone in your house is going to become annoyed with their constant moaning. The soundtrack was also something that completely surprised me. I wasn’t really expecting anything that impressive, but every time I finished the game I found myself humming the theme to myself. There are some songs that seem a little too westernized to fit the theme of the game, but most of them tend to be perfect in the context their needed. Although many complained about the mechanic of Dead Rising, I found myself having an immensely enjoyable time with it. The first time I went through the game, I made it my goal to familiarize myself with the mall and rescue as many hostages as I could. I thought I had explored the majority of the mall, but with my second play through I quickly realized I was wrong. I came across new areas as I played through the games storyline, and once again, I was surprised as to just how much there is to do within Dead Rising. Without spoiling anything for those of you who have yet to play it, there are many rewards waiting for those of you who decide to play through the cases of the game, and many things that will keep the player coming back for more. If you want a great single player game and have a love for zombie movies, there isn’t a better game for you than Dead Rising. While Dead Rising isn’t perfect due to its very unforgiving way of throwing the player into an unfamiliar world with little to no guidance, it is exactly what most hardcore gamers will love. A challenging game that will reward those who decide to stick with it from beginning to end. Kim Fidler',\n",

       " {'deck': 'Sega Superstars Tennis (X360) - Review by Kim Fidler',\n",
       "  'description': ' Whenever a new tennis game hits the market, it seems that I\\'m always right there to greet it with open arms. I\\'ve never been a huge tennis fan, but the games always seem to hook me with their easy to master controls, non-confusing rule sets, and colorful graphics. Sega Superstars Tennis is no exception. Having played all of the Mario Tennis games to death, I was a little apprehensive about entering into the world of Sonic and Co. It\\'s almost like cheating on your girlfriend that you never fought with. There\\'s no reason to stray, you feel bad about it, but when all is said and done, you\\'re glad you did it. Sega Superstars Tennis takes the best aspects of the Sega world, mixes them all together, and creates a game that not only looks great, but is actually fun. The main modes of the game are split between what you\\'ve come to expect of the genre. Singles matches, doubles matches, tournaments, and multiplayer. Where SST expands on the modes is with the mini-games and aptly titled \"Superstars\" mode. Superstars mode is best described as quest-mode. The player chooses a stage that they\\'d like to conquer, and are then thrust into every single type of mini-game relating to the stage. Some stages only have singles tournaments, where others are full fledged mini-games which are unlocked after completing all tasks within the level. For example, to unlock the \"Puyo Pop\" mini-game in the main menu, you will have to work through the various things asked of you within Superstars mode. Whether that is clearing a whole screen of Puyos, or obtaining a high score, you\\'ll always be working towards a reward. With over 100 levels, Superstars mode is where most people will spend the majority of their time.If you are a Sega fan, there will be a ton of stuff for you to see within the game. Every level is crafted in pure Sega fashion, with Sega music, and cameos from all your favorite Sega stars. In total there are 16 playable characters ranging from Sonic to all the way to Alex Kidd. With the inclusion of the 16 characters, it would have been nice to see some of the more known Sega characters make an appearance. I mean, they could have used characters from Power Stone, Crazy Taxi, and Skies of Arcadia, but I suppose they\\'ll be appearing in the followups. Along with the characters, fans are being treated to 10 stages based on some new, and old sega games. While some are great (Jet Set Radio), there are some that just aren\\'t that fun to play on (Curien Mansion aka House of the Dead). The House of the Dead stage just doesn\\'t fit with what I want in a tennis game - a colorful court that doesn\\'t put me in a pissy mood. SST has a great variety of courts, but it would have been nice to have courts for all of the different games in the Superstars mode. For example, the Golden Axe stage is Curien Mansion, instead of being a full fledged Golden Axe level.With a few exceptions in framerate, everything looks really great in Sega Superstars Tennis. Most of the courts are decorated with enough scenery to not make them look bland, and the character models look better than they ever have before. It\\'s actually rather entertaining to see Gilius from Golden Axe in HD, beside Sega\\'s new school line-up of Shadow, Ulala, and Pudding. One of the more annoying factors about the graphics is how the slowdown on some stages directly affects the gameplay. I really only encountered it on Dr. Eggman\\'s stage, but it makes it frustrating enough to ruin the whole experience. There\\'s nothing more annoying than trying to run across the court to hit a ball, than feeling like your stuck in framerate hell. The sound in SST is passable, but after a few hours of play you\\'ll be finding yourself throwing on a custom playlist. There are tons of classic Sega tunes to unlock, but when that\\'s all there is to listen to, it tends to get old pretty fast. Character voices, while done really well, get repetitive quickly. After every serve you\\'ll hear the same thing over and over, and after a few games you\\'ll want to turn them right off. All complaints aside, the sound is what many would expect of a classic Sega title. Quirky sounds and music that feel right at home with the Sega brand.If you have ever played a Sega tennis game, you will know that they are the masters of the craft. You could hand the controls over to someone who has never played a tennis title, and in mere minutes they could be rallying with the best of them. All shots and swings are controlled with two buttons, while activating the special meter is set to the triggers. The actual gameplay flows smoothly, and often you\\'ll find yourself not even thinking about your next move. The only confusing aspect of the controls is how they binded the lob and drop shots to a button combo, rather than a single button. I was about 6 hours into the game before I even realized that I could drop a shot close to the net, or lob a shot over my opponents head. In my opinion, it would have made much more sense to bind them to the two unused buttons. All in all, It\\'s nice to see a company focus more on the controls aspect than anything else.One of the more annoying features about SST is the online multiplayer. While it ran decently, there still are some lag issues that need to be fixed. The ball almost appears to stick to player\\'s racquets, making it very difficult to time a return. There also really isn\\'t a way to set up some good games, because there never really seems to be anyone playing. I spent about 2 hours one evening, and I think I managed to find about 8 games. I\\'m not sure why the online is empty, but hopefully now that the price has dropped on the game more people will check out some online games. While Sega Superstars isn\\'t a perfect game, that doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s not worth checking out. It\\'s easy to pick up and play, and a great way to get your non-gaming girlfriend into gaming. Doubles games will provide hours of entertainment among friends, and the Superstars mode will satisfy any single player gaming sessions. With a brand new price point, it\\'s probably one of the best titles you can get for $20.Kim Fidler',\n",

       " {'deck': 'dogsounds reviews: Halo 3. Oorah!',\n",
       "  'description': 'Originally written a week after launch.So, now I have had a week to get to grips with Halo 3, let\\'s see if the hype and furore surrounding its launch was worth it. I will try to keep things spoiler-free as best I can, so no give-away screenshots or excessive story spoilers (although I will assume that you are at least familiar with the storyline of the previous two games).With the sales success of Halo 2, Bungie was always going to have an uphill struggle in terms of expectations for Halo 3. Despite critical acclaim, many fans found Halo 2 wanting in many aspects, most of all in terms of its cliff-hanger ending, which launched many a controller. Some complained that the campaign was too fractured; that the Arbiter sections detracted from the overall gameplay and story as, after all, everyone wants to be the Master Chief. Some lamented the weapon balancing in multiplayer, and still more gradually faded out of multiplayer altogether because of the rife cheating and glitching. Halo 2 showed us the best - and the worst - of Xbox Live. To many, it felt rushed, cut, and lacking.Still, all that aside, it was a good game, although it was never going to create a following as strong as that of its forerunner, Halo: Combat Evolved.So Bungie had a two-fronted battle on their hands. Firstly, live up to the benchmark of gameplay and immersion that the first instalment created. Second, resolve all the flaws of, and better, the second instalment. No pressure, lads...So we come to Halo 3, possibly the most-hyped game ever.The story takes place following the events in Halo 2, with a short gap, which is filled in by the comic-book adptation. Despite political shifts within the Covenant itself, leaving it as an alliance between the Brutes, Grunts, Drones, Hunters and Prophets, the agenda of the Prophet of Truth is unchanged - wipe out Humanity, locate the Ark, and activate the remaining Halo installations to bring about the \"Great Journey\". Earth is suffering, and is pretty much subjugated despite the best efforts of the UNSC and its new-found allies, the Elites. The story starts in Africa, where the Covenant fleet is hard at work excavating a massive artifact in the African desert - that seen in the E3 announcement trailer.During the campaign, playing as Master Chief, you will aid your Marine and Elite compatriots in battling the Covenant, in an attempt to save humanity and to stop the Prophet of Truth from activiating the Halos - which are in fact vast weapons designed to prevent the spread of the parasitic life-form known as the Flood - and wiping out all sentient life in the galaxy in the process. You will fight in many different locations, and will have at your disposal some new weapons and vehicles.   The Elites are back, but this time around we like them. We don\\'t shoot them.The story itself is very well crafted, is less fractured than in Halo 2 and answers a fair number of the questions that previous incarnations have posed. However, it still throws some surprises at you, and will also end up leaving you with a fair number of new questions from out of left-field. Damn you, Bungie!The campaign is well-structured, and although not perfect in every single way, will satisfy most folks. It does ring up a little short - a few more levels would have been nice, after three years, but what there is is not unusually short - probably about average for a first-person shooter. Controls are a doddle, although slightly different to the tried and tested method, thanks to the inclusion of deployable equipment, which is controlled by the X-button. Reload is now done via the bumper button, both if you are dual wielding. The \"use/activate\" button is now also controlled via the right bumper. it takes a few minutes to get used to it if you are familiar with the old control schemes, but once you get it, you are home and dry.Weapons are a mix of old and new. All the old favourites return. The pistol is still the Magnum, I am afraid, so no scope. And yes, it is still nerfed, as is the plasma pistol. However, where the human pistol is pretty much redundant, the plasma pistol still plays the key role in removing an enemies\\' shields with one overcharged shot, same as Halo and Halo 2. Fighting Brutes with power armor on harder difficulty levels makes the plasma pistol a definite go-to weapon. The needler is no longer a dual-wield weapon, but thankfully has finally been beefed up to be pretty decent against most enemies, again, especially Brutes. The Brute Shot has also been improved, with a faster fire rate and more accurate placement of shots - making it a weapon to favour for crowd control. Everything else is pretty much the same, more or less, and if Halo 2 gave you a prediliction for certain weapon combos, you\\'ll probably take the same here.However, new to the arsenal are the Brute Spike Rifle - an equivalent of the SMG, but with more oomph and less kick, and the Brute Mauler - a smal, dual-wieldable shotgun equivalent. You probably won\\'t favour the Mauler much though, it\\'s dispersal pattern is horribly wide, making it useless at anything more then very close quarters. Also making it into the game - finally - is the flamethrower. But, contain your excitement - it appears rarely in the campaign, and is again a close-quarters weapon. Most times in campaign you need to use it in a tight area - but end up setting fire to everything around you, including yoruself, more often than not. Lastly, you are able to play with the Brutes\\' Gravity Hammer, last seen wielded by Tartarus in Halo 2, an awesome melee weapon that simply decimates most enemies in your path, and has the best weapon effect of all. It\\'s a simple weapon, hit the trigger to swipe or press \"B\" to melee, much like the Covenant Energy Sword.   The Assault Rifle makes a welcome return in Halo 3. And we love it.The major addition to the weapons are the heavy weapons - those usually found mounted on brackets - the human machine gun turret, the Plasma turret, the Misslie Pod, and the aforementioned flamethrower. These are all big weapons, and their usefulness is against large crowds of enemies. However, when mounted they have infinite ammo, but press \"B\" to rip them from their mountings and suddenly you have a limited supply of rounds. One downside to these weapons is that their weight makes you move slower - so whilst you are \"mowing the lawn\" with them, you are also an easier target to hit. Using them changes your view to third-person, however, so you are afforded a better view of the battle. It\\'s all about tactical considerations.And finally, the biggest shift in weaponry is the use of \"deployable equipment\". These are devices that you can pick up in the battlefield and use once against your enemies with a press of the \"X\" button. Most have a limited lifespan of about 20 seconds or so, and include the power drainer, which when dropped creates a blue field that will drain the shields of any enemies within its radius, and even stop vehicles dead in their tracks. On the flipside is a power regenerator, which will allow sheilds to regenerate super-quick. You also have a flare, which blinds enemies around you, and enemies that cannot see are easier to take out. The radar jammer confuses enemies by making multiple targets appear on their motion-trackers, and the trip-mine does exactly what it says on the tin - sits there and waits for an enemy or vehicle to get to close and explodes. Finally, there is the well-known bubble shield, a temporary protective dome that will not allow any weapons fire or grenades to pass through it - a little safe haven for you to hide in whilst your shields are down. However, just as weapons fire cannot go in, it can also not go out - so keep your finger away from the grenade trigger, or you may end up giving yourself a nasty surprise. People can walk freely through the shield and still pose a close-up threat so you need to bear this in mind when deploying it. Then again, it can be useful for luring an enemy to you - when they see the bubble, they assume you are in trouble and move in for the kill. The gameplay of the campaign would be so-so without all these new additions, but with the new weapons and equipment, there is a gret deal of replay value to be had. When you bear in mind that enemies can use ALL the equipment and weapons available to you, and often do to great effect, it makes each encounter unpredictable. In one example, I launched a rocket at a group of three Brutes, only for one to deploy a bubble-shield to protect themselves. So, I ran over, intent on taking them out close quarters. As I got close, another left the bubble and threw a flare, utterly blinding me in the process. Knowing this he started firing his spike rifle at me - but I had a regenerator, which I blindly deployed to keep my shields up. Their solution - the third Brute deployed his power drainer, which worked against the regenerator, draining my shields and allowing me to die a nasty, spiked death. What amazed me was that this was not scripted, just each Brute AI acting tactically to their advantage and to my untimely end. Awesome.In terms of visuals, Halo 3 is, to be blunt, utterly gorgeous. There are some who are dismayed at the fact that the games runs at 640p and not true 720p or 1080p. \"Not high-defnintion!\" they cry. Well, technically, anything over 480p is high-definition. But you know, if the price of all the unerring lighting, beautiful vistas and lush settings is that it runs at a little less than 720p natively, I could care less. Bungie have stated that if you compare the native resolution to an upscaled 720p or 1080p image (which is what the Xbox 360 does by default) it is almost impossible to tell the difference. Some textures are a little clunky close up, but I feel you have to take the visuals as a whole. Don\\'t focus on the fact that the boots on that marine look a little schmushy - focus on the fact that his schmushy boot is standing on a gorgeous mountainside in a rolling landscape of waterfalls, beaches, jungle, buildings and vegetation. There\\'s always a trade. Whilst it is not the most detailed game ever close-up, overall the style of Halo 3 is not photorealistic, rather it is true to the previous Halo games - highly stylised, and beautiful. I would put Halo 3 over Gears Of War any day.   The Xbox 360 has allowed Bungie to create some huge and stunning settings for the game. This is a *small part* of one expansive level. Audio is outstanding, as ever, from ambient environmental sounds to weapons fire, vehicles and dialogue. Bungie have taken great care to get everything sounding just right in 5.1 surround, and this is the first game to offer realtime 5.1 processing and sound management , in-game, on the fly. Distant weapons fire is wonderfully different to that heard close-up, similar to the effects in Medal Of Honor: Airborne - only done much, much better. Every sound has a distant counterpart. I would say though that oftentimes the Assault Rifle and Battle Rifle you carry can sound a little faint. Voice acting is outstanding, and most of the old regulars reprise their roles. The only major character differently voiced is Miranda Keyes. Grunts have regained their Halo 1 voices, thankfully, and no longer speak in that silly baby-talk they had in Halo 2. And as ever, some of their combat dialogue is hilarious. Hearing a grunt say \"You killed my brother! Again!\"? Classic.As touched on before, AI is very good, and allows for some interesting randomness. Grunts will still flee in panic if you take out their Brute leader, and very occasionally a Grunt will simply go section 8 and run at you with a plasma grenade in both hands, kamikaze-style. Brutes are aggressive and depending on their rank within the Brute heirarchy will range from annoying to downright nightmare. Your marines are pretty good shots, thankfully, but alas it seems the UNSC still hasn\\'t taught them how to drive very well. Whilst they may not regularly run you over in a vehicle as they did in Halo 1, most times it is better to do the driving yourself and let them point the guns.   Trust me, it is better if you drive. They may be able to aim a bullet, but the Marines suck at aiming a vehicle. Talking of vehicles, there are a few new additions to the pack. The existing vehciles are there, largely unchanged, although both the Wraith and the human Scorpion tank now require a separate dude to fire the secondary gun - you only control the cannon. New to the garage is the Brute Chopper - similar to the Ghost in many ways, except for the large, scary spinning wheels on the front, that make mincemeat of both personnel and vehicles. They kind of feel like large scary Harleys, and this fits with the Brutes\\' almost road-warrior like image. There is also the Prowler - a Brute analog of the Warthog, again with a gunner and driver, as well as passengers, occasionally. Armed with a plasma cannon, and sharp, pointy front, this vehicle can be a formidable opponent - get hit by it, and you die. And the Brutes know it.So, overall, campaign offers you a good-looking, fun-filled gameplay experience, heightened by the variations afforded by equipment and AI. Bungie have said that to get the best experience out of the game, you should play through on the third-hardest diffculty setting, Heroic. There are also, as in Halo 2, multiple skulls you can collect in little hidden areas of the game maps, that generally offer achievement points and add extra levels of difficulty to the game such as removing your HUD, making enemies twice as hard to kill, giving less ammo in dropped weapons and so on. But there is one thing left that makes the campaign stand high above every other game out there, and makes the game\\'s hardest difficulty setting, Legendary, possible: up to four-player co-op.In Halo 3 you can do what no other game lets you do: team up with up to three friends - either with two or four Xboxen via system link, or over Xbox Live, to run through the entire campaign. Over Live, you can all be at home, so you can have have the luxury of playing with three friends and keeping your TV screen all to yourself. In co-op, the host player plays as the Chief, and the second player plays alongside as the Arbiter. If you add two more players, they are Elites. This adds a whole new aspect to the game, not just in terms of gameplay, but in terms of a social gameplay. Now playing with your friends is not just restricted to multiplayer deathmatches. And if you think this is all Bungie have put into the box, think again; there are more add-ons that affect multiplayer that make this whole package have even more longevity.The multiplayer itself does not require much of a write up - it\\'s Halo. Thankfully, it is more Halo 1 than Halo 2, for which many of us will be grateful. But if you know your Halo, you know what multiplayer is like.   Multiplayer. It\\'s Halo. I don\\'t need to explain.What makes it more special though are two things: The Forge, and Saved Films. In The Forge, you can go into any multiplayer map (outside of the normal multiplayer environment) and tweak it to your hearts\\' content. Although you can\\'t change the actual level geometry, you can change just about everything else - from weapons to scenery, vehicles and gameplay rules. You can create whole new gametypes never seen before. And whilst you are doing this, up to eight people can be playing in your map whilst you edit it. You can set the game so that anyone can edit. When you go into edit mode, you become a floating monitor - like 343 Guilty Spark. And with the ability to spawn vehicles and weapons at will, where you like, within the limits of a strict budget, hilarity can ensue. Is your team getting hammered? No problem, spawn a Scoprion tank in your base and watch your guys go to town. Trying to protect your flag? Easy, put a whole shitload of trip mines around it, on a quick respawn. These matches are not ranked, and are just for fun, but make for some cracking crazy times.Second is the Saved Films feature. Now, every single campaign or multiplayer match you play in is saved as a data file, and in Saved Films you can play back the whole game. Not only that, but you can pause, rewind, advance, take screenshots, and even (in multiplayer) record short clips. These screenshots and films are uploaded to your profile at www.bungie.net (everyone has one - it is based on your gamertag. If you have an Xbox Live account, sign in using that and you can see all your stats, from every game you have ever played), and from there you can save them to your computer, or post them on the forums for all the world to see. You can go back and watch a multiplayer match and, with a completely detachable camera, examine the tactics of anyone who pwned your ass. Or you can simply use the camera to get the perfect screenshot, or explore the maps to see if you can find any hidden secrets or eggs (or in Campaign, hidden skulls).   Completing the campaign on various difficulties and getting other achievements throughout the game unlocks different armour variants for multiplayer.These two features bring a level of community and depth to the game that no-one has created before, something that Bungie have always prided themselves on, something that most other developers don\\'t bother with - most just want to sell a good game. Were it not for The Forge and Saved Films, Halo 3 would be a pretty good, but still pretty average shooter. But with these two additions, was it worth all the hype? Will the fans be pleased? I think so. With a marvellous story, some beautiful visuals, and The Forge and Saved Films, Halo 3 becomes a game with something that every designer hopes their game will have.Longevity. ',\n",

The campaign while short seems like it was enough, each level, stage, whatever kept the story going, there were no useless boring bits a fluff. In addition to the compelling story and fantastic level design there is a difficulty for every level of gamer from recruit (grandmas could walk through this crap) to veteran (you'll cry, trust me :D). The controls are very intuitive and can be picked up in about ten or fifteen minutes tops. The graphics and sound are very believable, each gun sounds real with very nicely done recoil. The frame rate is very stable I haven't noticed any really bad shuddering.Overall the singleplayer alone makes this game worth having.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Now for the real good stuff, multiplayer, every game type is fun and well designed and there's one for everybody from straight up death match to hardcore objective games. The awesome custom class based system is so well designed so no matter what level your at you never feel completely out gunned it's never like you have to work to get the only good weapons and you never feel like youy only lost the game just because the other team had higher level guns. Each map has a good layout and plays well though some favor certain game types. The custom classes let you play to your specific style and five custom slots gives you plenty of options.\\xa0\\xa0 COD4 is the best shooter I've ever played the singleplayer and story is compelling, tie that together with an awesome multiplayer system with cool maps and well designed game types and you've got yourself a definite buy, and I can recommend this game to any fan of shooters.\",\n",

Flamethrower does as expected and Plasma gun straight up evaporates them.Level design is nice with a good variety of enviroments to plow through. Toxic wastelands, futuristic cave networks and office buildings are all locations the player can expect to visit.

       "  'description': ' There\\'s something about Lego that never really grows old. You could have been given your first Lego set at 5 years old, and 20 years later still feel inclined to play with it. I remember going home about 5 years after I had moved out and finding my box of Legos that I had last played with when I was about 11. There was a knife in there that I spent about 4 hours on trying to make it look as realistic as possible. At the bottom of the box, another unfinished masterpiece that I believe was going to be a handgun. Then I sat back and tried to recall why I was such a messed up kid.A couple of years ago I got to relive my love for Legos. Lego: Star Wars hit the major systems and while it wasn\\'t the same, it was just as cool as the first time you built the Millennium Falcon out of Lego. There was little lego versions of Darth Maul, Chewbacca, and all my favorite locals from the new trilogy were present. It was a great day, that was only triumphed by the release of the Original Trilogy. With those releases I had a conversation with a group of friends about what modern day classics should be recreated in the Lego Universe. The game I played this past week was one of those suggestions.Lego: Indiana Jones is just as it sounds. A Lego game that allows gamers to relive the events from the three Indiana Jones films, but this time, in full HD. I know that last line sounds a little out of place, I mean, could the graphics in a game about Lego really be improved that much from the last generation? The answer? Yes they can. From the minute I entered into the first level, I was immediately impressed with how much they improved the graphics engine. The environments are filled with stuff to smash like the Star Wars games, but this time it just looks more crisp and enjoyable. Each character is modeled to look like super-deformed version of who they\\'re representing, and it kind of makes you wish the Star Wars titles were built from the ground up to be played on the Current-Gen systems. The general gameplay in Lego Indiana Jones, is still pretty much the same. You run around a level, build Lego objects, smash Lego objects, attack enemies, and get rich or die trying. Well, not exactly die because in the Lego universe, you can never truly die. You have hearts representing your health but after playing it for a couple of hours, you\\'ll ask yourself \"Why bother?\" When you die you just lose a couple of the collectible Lego pieces used as currency and respawn on the spot. It kind of takes away a good chunk of the challenge, but when you take the major demographic into consideration, I could see what they were going for. A nice easy game to pick up and play without getting frustrated. It works.Each movie in the trilogy is broken up into several levels with different environments for Indy and his entourage to explore. The scene with the big boulder in Raiders of the Lost Ark, the Heart ripping scene from Temple of Doom, and the chase scene from Last Crusade. It\\'s all in there, and it is instant nostalgia for anyone who has ever been a fan of the series. One of the big setbacks in terms of going from Star Wars to Indiana Jones, has to be the fact that I didn\\'t really want to play as anyone else but Indiana Jones. As you go through the game you can unlock a ton of new characters, but when it really came down to it, I kept switching back to Jones. Not a huge deal, but when you have about 10 different versions of Indy to choose from, you quickly come to the realization that the developer had a hard time filling out the roster.For fans of the John Williams score from Indiana Jones, you\\'ll be pleasantly surprised to find it pretty much intact. Everything is recreated perfectly, and with each and every stage you\\'re treated to one of the better treatments of a licensed property. Too many movie to videogame translations have been finding their way to store shelves with straight to game music, but with any of the Traveller\\'s Tales titles, they\\'ve taken the time to get it right. It adds that extra level of polish in a game that doesn\\'t necessarily need to be immersive at all. It\\'s pretty sad when a game focused around little Lego men running around gives you a better sense of \"being there,\" than games that really need it.While the initial game will only take you about 6-9 hours to play through, like the other Lego games, there is plenty to do after that. There are a ton of characters to unlock, and thankfully each of them has a use to help you on your way to achieving a 100% completion. For those of us that have OCD, we are once again given some extra levels if we so choose to take on the task of wanting to do everything in the game. There\\'s some Young Indy levels, some special Lego themed ones, and a ton of extras to unlock that will change how the game plays. Add on Achievements if you\\'re playing the Xbox 360 version, and you have yourself a game that you could spend nearly 30-40 hours on. That\\'s alot of Lego.Is Indiana Jones worth it? At the time I am writing this, I have already saw the game on the shelf for $40 on sale, and it is most definitely worth $40. After playing through Lego Indy, I can safely say that I am getting a little burnt out on the formula. It works, but not enough is really changing with the gameplay to keep me coming back for more. I was cool up until I was near the end of Lego Indiana Jones, and while it is no fault of the game, it\\'s just a fault of the standard set by the Lego Star wars games. If this is your first Lego themed game and you\\'re a fan of Indiana Jones, then I say that you should check it out. If you\\'re not really familiar with the movie, I would suggest checking out \"Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga,\" in stores now, or \"Lego Batman\" later on this year. If you are one of the thousands of people who played the Lego Star Wars titles to death, then I don\\'t know if I can recommend Lego Indiana Jones too highly. It\\'s a relevant title, but I don\\'t see it really being worth a purchase. Pick it up if you get a good deal, or just wait for a series that you really love. I have a feeling that there is going to be many, many more movies and games that get the Lego treatment. *cough* Matrix trilogy please *cough*Kim Fidler',\n",

       "  'description': 'So if World War 2 isn\\'t your thing then what war fits you? Well there is Nam\\', that is if you want to play a game with no real conclusion. Perhaps you\\'d like a throwback to those good ol\\' Civil War or Revolutionary War days? Nothing says a good game like Nostalgia and guns that can\\'t hit the broad side of a barn. So what? What war is left? How about a pseudo Cold-War? Instead of it being cold and boring, ala a competition in who can spend the most money, the Soviet Union decides to invade America. Sound interesting? How about if you add an American Propagandist spin along with a lack of FPS game play mechanic? In fact, it\\'s an RTS.  While this review is a tad late, and I know World in Conflict came out some time ago. That won\\'t stop me from writing a review about it. In case you, the reader, doesn\\'t know, I am not the biggest RTS fan, although I love and enjoyed Dawn of War along with Company of Heroes. Company of Heroes always touted as having very intense game play. While it was focused on smaller amounts of units it delivered epic explosions and turning of the tides. World in Conflict out does CoH. Plain and simple the battles are intense, full of explosions and one can\\'t help but want to put a carpet bomb on every suburb of America just to see it explode. The point though is to save America, not to get distracted and kill your grandma.   This game is beautiful, staying away from the stark color palette of most War game is delivers the lush landscape of Pacific Coast, albeit the country is being attacked, but pause the game and stare at the trees and skyscrapers for a while, you won\\'t be disappointed. With plenty of attention to detail you won\\'t be crying for any lack of ambiguous features. If you\\'ve got the hardware you will get to see Ground Deformation (which does effect game play), God Rays!, and Volumetric clouds along with Volumetric lighting (which makes the god rays.) So overall, if you\\'ve got the hardware for it, and I hope you do, the amount of fidelity in this game will keep your eyes tearing as you strain to see all the beauty within. Real quick note before I get to game play, single player and multiplayer aspects of the game: Graphics=Amazing for an RTS, Sound=Awesome, Voice Acting=Decent (expanded on later). Then some quick notes as to bad sides of the game: Slows down when the fray gets too intense (Nukes anyone?), may have one or two crashes.   Aside from Company of Heroes, has one of the best Single-Player experiences I have ever had the joy, scratch that. It is one of the few that has caused me to think, \"If I were odd I would so have an orgasm over this.\" If I did that would disappoint my girlfriend so, I didn\\'t. The fact is that the story is engaging and actually brings it close to home. Basically, America is attacked by the Soviet Union and you have to repel them out of our country before that take our Jerbs! (Sorry for the South Park reference.) So while Regan may not get to live his one and true glory, \"Gorbachev, tear down this wall,\" you will get to force them out of your country. Although it has a more sinister side, you plant an atomic bomb on your own country! Sorry, that was a spoiler, I\\'ll stop. Throughout the game you listen to military drama, which at times to me seems juvenile. Perhaps people from the 80s shouldn\\'t be allowed to be in the military. Anyways, the story itself is engaging and will keep you hooked until the games climax, which is, for lack of a better word, EPIC! The learning curve is a bit high if you\\'ve never played an RTS but for the most part the controls are the same. Although, what they changed (camera control) is more intuitive than how other RTS makers have done it.   Replayability? Yes? No? Maybe? Well yes, the multiplayer is (\"is\" was the 666th word typed for this review.) fantastic. That is only true if you actually have skill. If you\\'re void of talent or a strategic mind then it may be best to only play with friends (3 is a good comfort zone) or have them join you on a server that way you\\'re not a noob; Yes this game has strategy, unlike Supreme Commander, Command and Conquer, and even Company of Heroes where you can overpower the enemy by having more or far superior troops, to win in World in Conflict you have to use your TA and troops conservatively and strategically. So either playing with friends or with friends on a server with people much better than you is the only way to go. That is, unless you\\'re that person that decimated my squadron of Tanks. I mentioned TA. Tactical Aid is a feature in this game that I can say is the definitive staple mark. As you kill the enemy and capture areas you gain TA. You can either build your own TA up or combine your teams and use it to call in tanks, paratroopers, napalm, chemical explosions, carpet bombs, artillery strikes, and NUKES! The Nukes are spectacular.   Now I feel my reviews aren\\'t comprehensive, but I\\'ve tried to give you an idea of the game through emotion. The game play is good, both single player and multiplayer, although the multiplayer definitely has a huge learning curve when compared to the single player portion of the game. So if you\\'re bored of your current games and want to check out a new and fun RTS with some hilarious, yet decent voice acting, an intriguing story, good graphics and overall good game play then go check out World in Conflict.',\n",

       "  'description': \"This was back in 2005, and I hadn't played a first person shooter since Doom. I was just seriously getting into gaming and the industry in general so I was branching out from the usual games I would play, Japanese role playing games and other story based adventure tales. I liked those specific genres because of the story, which would keep me interested and give me context that would give me a reason to finish the game. Somewhat myopically, I thought that those were the only games where I could get that kind of feeling. Then, I played Half-Life 2.  I don't know how I'd expected the game to start, with some kind of epic shootout that would befit my view of this genre, or some such nonsense. It's become a big talking point now, though, that even if you haven't played the game, you'd know that the first few minutes of this game are spent in observation of the environment. That's Valve's strong suit – they can convey ideas through the environment without specifically having to say them out loud through any sort of dialogue. It's similar to the way that a good film can convey an idea without necessarily having any characters speak onscreen, or how a book can give you a vision of what's going on without  a large amount of description of environment or characters. It's the faith in the audience that comes through the extensive amount of playtesting that Valve employs which I enjoy so much.  The way the game is paced is very different in the context of a video game, as well. It starts off very slow and there's long sections that some players tend not to like. I noticed that when the game went to consoles, many players didn't want to continue with the game after the long airboat section. It's this pacing that I really enjoy about the game. I never feel like these sections are artificially long. With the buggy and the airboat, they're broken up by more on foot sections throughout the levels. They are artificially gated, of course, but it doesn't necessarily feel that way because of the way it's designed. I always felt like I was exploring and I happened to do what I needed to do. I never saw the rails that were guiding my experience.  The thing I was most surprised about was the narrative. I had never played a game like this with story integrated into my experience. There's still the equivalent of cutscenes, but they feel different when the game doesn't take your control away. The actual story itself isn't particularly special, as a dystopian future tale that has been explored through all different media for years and years, but for the first time, the player feels like they're actually living in this world instead of just an idle spectator.  I can say without a doubt that Half-Life 2 was what got me into games in general, and even ignoring the effect it had on the industry as a whole, I enjoy it for that reason alone. You can see how the game influenced most shooters nowadays – Bioshock, Call of Duty 4, and just the linear story based first person shooter owes a great debt to this game's success.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"For a while Wii Sports was my most anticipated game for the Wii. Then came the news that the games were really simple. My heart sank. I no longer anticipated the game and that was that. This may be the reason why I find it to be so much fun. Yes it has it's share of problems, but overall the game is so much fun that you just don't care.  As a game there isn't much here. Wii Sports has the traditional exhibition modes that are more for multiplayer and hi-scores than anything else.You can do a training mode which unlocks more training games. All of this can be done in less than an hour. That leaves the Brain Age style Workout mode. Like Brain Age it's not really too much of a game. What makes all of this work even for single player is the amount of fun it is to try and best your hi-scores in some of the better games. This all owes much to the Wii controller and how unique it is.  There are a total of 5 games included in the package. All of which are multiplayer and have fun training/minigame style modes. These games are Tennis, Baseball, Bowling, Golf, and Boxing. Let's start off with the best games.  Bowling, Golf, and Baseball was where I had most of my fun. Bowling is probably the best example of how fun the Wii can be. You can pretty much do everything that bowling has to offer. Golf is another game that has many of the features that you would expect, and can be very competitive among friends. The swing mechanics are very interesting and fun. There is a little problem with putting softly since the remote doesn't detect really soft hits. For many people Baseball is probably a throw away game. It's one of the games that has been simplified probably too much. You cannot control your fielders or runners. It's basically a pitcher vs hitter game. And in my eyes it's a pretty good one. It requires patience to get your pitch (against a real person), and when you do it feels amazing. Almost like the real thing.  Then we come to the lower two. Tennis can be fun, but not being able to control your character makes you feel helpless to hits that you are sure you would otherwise get. Boxing however is just bad overall. It is the one game that could benefit the most from the two motion sensing controllers, but in the end it just doesn't work well. The controllers are unresponsive which just turns into a waving your arms in the air fest.  All of these games have graphics that aren't amazing, but they work. Work enough to where I don't have an opinion one way or the other. They certainly aren't great, but they don't detract in any way from the game. The same goes for the sound. It sounds fine and the effect and music is memorable. Especially after hours of playing the same sport over and over.  What really keeps Wii Sports from being just a tech demo is the multiplayer. There is nothing like bowling with 3 friends in your living room. Or the tension when it's the final inning and your down 1 run, and of course the trash talk about how you swing cannot be replicated on any other console. It is a downer that there are not as many options for the different games as one would like. For example you can only play 3 innings in Baseball.  Wii Sports is a great pack-in game that shows just how much fun the Wii can be. It's not the kind of game one would want to become the standard for all Wii games, but it is great fun, and a great first step.PROS+ Great ideas+ Bowling and Baseball are solid fun+ Smart use of Mii's+ Great pack inCONS- Boxing is terrible- Lack of depth in some games- Really only fun with friends\",\n",

       "  'description': 'From the moment I turned off my Gamecube, and flicked off the TV after beating one of my favorite games of all time, Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, I didn’t think that Paper Mario game, and even a sequel could beat its excellence. Well, guess what? I was absolutely right. When they first announced the sequel to Paper Mario 2, Super Paper Mario for the Gamecube, I was in instant happiness, but well, I knew it’d happen some day. In fact, I was so excited, that when I read that it was going in a different direction and into this new Platforming style, I instantly knew that this game was never going to be better, or even as good as Paper Mario 64, or Paper Mario 2. Why you ask? Well, I was in denial. But once everything came together, and how they were making it for the Wii, then I instantly became more aware that this game could very well be the best game on the Wii, besides Twilight Princess of course. So once I got my hands on it, and beat it, I actually didn’t feel that bad. Super Paper Mario is a solid game, but I got to say, it was a disappointment overall.\\xa0Peach, the sweetheart of Mario’s for the whole existence of Nintendo, is suddenly awaken to the site of a wedding ceremony, but who’s getting married you ask? Peach of course, but to who? Bowser. That’s right, Mario’s arch enemy, the Koopa King himself, Bowser. But why is she getting married to this monster? Well the answer is simple, she is being ordered to by, the main villain of Super Paper Mario: Count Bleck. When you first see Count Bleck, you notice how he looks like an evil villain, so you can safely assume that he’s in fact the main villain. But why is Count Bleck ordering Peach and Bowser to wed? Well, the answer is that Count Bleck possesses the Dark Prognosticus, a book that predicts the end of all world, and to do this, Peach must Marry Bowser. A void is opened in reality and it threatens to swallow up everything unless the hero, Mario, can get seven life hearts, which are like the Stars in the other Paper Mario’s, which will, as said in the Light Prognosticus, help Mario in defeating Count Bleck and destroying the void. The story is a typical Paper Mario story, with the little cinematic’s in between every Chapter’s end. The only problem with the story is that there’s tons, and I mean, tons of reading. By the end of the game, you’ve probably read through about the whole Lord of the Rings book, plus some. Well, no, I’m being sarcastic a bit, but there still is too much reading, even more than in past Paper Mario games. It also has a very predictable ending.\\xa0Super Paper Mario pretty much looks exactly like Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door for the Gamecube. Since Super Paper Mario was originally made for the Gamecube, and using the Gamecube for half of the development, makes the graphics pretty sub-par compared to what the Wii can really do. But, the games looks beautiful, no doubt about it. Every area you go in is colourful as a rainbow. The art style that was made famous in Paper Mario 2 made it’s return with most of the creatures in the game being made out of paper, and some of the enemies being in a cool folded style in 3D. Now, all this I’m talking about is when you’re playing in 2D mode, but when you switch over to the 3D side of things, it can get pretty ugly. Not ugly as in, ugly textures, or characters lose pixels or anything, I mean ugly as all of the colours just disappear because they’re all off to the side of the screen. It seems pretty cool when you see things from Mario’s viewpoint, but when you see that there’s absolutely no colours or anything, it makes you quite disappointed.Again, the music and sound in Super Paper Mario is about the same as in Paper Mario 2, with some more forgettable tunes. But some tunes are still stuck in my head with its catchy tunes, so it’s not all horrible. I really wish though, that Nintendo would get rid of this MIDI music it keeps using over, and over and over again. It’s time to get with the time and start using some real music. But all in all, Super Paper Mario still has the charming sounds it usually has like the “BOP!” when you jump on an enemy, or the “DUA DUA DUA!” when you hit a ? Block. It’s all still here. Mario also has most of his grunts and sounds that he usually makes, all probably from past Paper Mario games because non of them sound any different.\\xa0Super Paper Mario’s switch to a Platforming game was pretty great, but nowhere close to perfect. Now, you can kill enemies in real time, instead of going to the old battle scene, stopping you from moving forward in the game. Now, Mario can just jump on enemies, bit it’s not like old Mario games. This time, enemies have health, which is a certain number, and whenever Mario jumps on the enemy, it takes off some of the damage and tells you right away in the form of the ol’ star. You can also shake the Wii remote to gain extra experience which will eventually level you up, just like in past Paper Mario game. But the experience is different in Super Paper Mario. Instead of Star Points, you now just collect points that add up to your total. Then, once you reach a certain amount, you level up. There’s also no flower points anymore, so when you level up, only your max HP, and attack power moves up, but you can’t chose which one to raise. The controls are simple. You hold the Wii Remote sideways like a classic NES controller with the 1 and 2 buttons being beside each other like A and B. The directional pad moves Mario left, right, up and down, while the 2 button makes Mario jump, The 1 button uses the Pixl you’re using at the time, who are little friends you collect on your way through the main quest.\\xa0Pixl’s are like partners in other Paper Mario games. These Pixl’s let you do all sorts of things like turn paper thin, use a hammer, ground pound, and even shrink to almost the size of an ant. I like the idea of the Pixls, but sometimes it seems like some of them were just put in there because they couldn’t think of anything better. You can also play as 4 characters in total: Mario, Peach, Bowser, and Luigi. Mario can switch into 3D, Peach can float over surfaces with her umbrella, Bowser can breath fire, and Luigi can super-jump, which are really high jumps. You will probably end up using Mario for the most part because he’s the only character that can turn into 3D. Once you get past a certain part where you gain a certain ability, you can change the perspective from 2D, to 3D. Once in 3D, you have a time limit bar, which will run out eventually if you keep using it for too long. Once in 3D, things that seem impossible to go to become possible, and you can do things that you were never able to do in past Mario games. At one part in the game, there’s a giant cliff that you can’t jump over no matter what. But once you switch to 3D, a hill in the background goes over the cliff and lets you walk across it with ease. There’s also items that you can use that heal you, and certain items can make you stronger for a period of time. To use some items, you have to do a certain thing with the Wii Remote in order to get the top usage out of the item. Sometimes you must tilt the Wii Remote a certain way, sometimes you have to shack the Wii Remote, and sometimes you have to point at a certain spot, but it all works out at the end. To get into the mini-menu, you press both 1+2 together, but sometimes you accidentally press one of them first and causes you to do something you didn’t want to do. All in all, Super Paper Mario has some great gameplay, but it’s not perfected yet.\\xa0Yes, after you have beaten the final boss, you can save afterwards and continue to try to collect everything. The things you can still do after you beat the game is pretty much play the mini games at the arcade, and try to collect all of the recipes, there are no more Badges to collect. Collecting everything might take time, but I’d rather just play the game over again because it’s not an entirely long game, took me about 20 hours, but it’s not entirely short either, so it can be beefy, if you make it out to be.\\xa0Like I said before, I was right when I said no other Paper Mario game will ever be able to beat out the excellence of The Thousand Year Door, but Super Paper Mario is still a fantastic game, no doubt. There are some drawbacks in the gameplay, but there’s also drawbacks from the Music/sound department, and form the graphical department too. But to say that Super Paper Mario is as good, or even better than other Paper Mario’s before it is ridiculous. Super Paper Mario is a great game, but nowhere close, does it come to past Paper Mario game before it.\\xa0',\n",

       "  'description': 'Have you ever been in a drought? Or perhaps not a drought, maybe you\\'ve experienced a flood. If so, then you know what it\\'s like to see another World War 2 game appear on the shelves at GameStop or EB Games (which are one in the same). The genre itself, World War 2 Game, can be broken down into two types the FPS and then the RTS World War 2 Game. In both areas games struggle to be the crème of the crop or at least stand out from the rest. The FPS that stood out for me, and most, was the CoD series. Then of course our RTS father, or at least the mother of World War 2 RTS games is Company of Heroes. Both of these games have a fine tuned game play mechanic that no one else has been able to replicate. When I say no one, I mean even studios that have worked on the Call of Duty series such as Treyarch and Spark haven\\'t been able to touch Infinity Ward\\'s quality, although the former did it the best.  Call of Duty 3 is another, run of the mill, World War 2 game. We know how it ends, America and its allies triumph over the Axis of evil which includes Germany, Italy, and Japan, all the others were really just little nuances in the overall picture. Let\\'s mention the things I like about Call of Duty 3 on the Xbox 360. It\\'s more of the same; it\\'s more of that tried and true formula from Call of Duty 2. Now I replayed the single-player in Call of Duty 2 I\\'d say three to four times and the single-player for around 60-Hours; it, to me, is the pinnacle of World War 2 games. Now I am a bit late of playing Call of Duty 3 and submitting a review. Here\\'s what I liked about the game:   The graphics are well, they are pretty. Although some areas could be improved; a la texture mapping maybe or scaling to widescreen. A lot of times I felt like the textures were stretched to fit a 16:9 aspect ratio or characters at times looked more so fat, or for lack of a better metaphor, as if they took a duce in their pants and never bothered to go empty it into the closest lavatory. The use of HDR and bloom is a nice touch, although, albeit a bit overdone in some areas. Perhaps the most beautiful aspect of this game comes from when the action gets going and when the graphical fidelity ramps up. With grenades going off and some motion blur kicking in, it reinforces the idea that this is war, and it is hell. The guns are well modeled, although sometimes lacking detail (a la MP44) and then the grass in the game. Let\\'s not forget the grass. This is actually a huge improvement over the engine that I would go prone just to be sneaking in the grass. I mean, who doesn\\'t want to frolic through the grass?  In order to move on beyond mechanics and graphics or anything that is purely artificial in my mind (it\\'s a video game, what isn\\'t?), here is what I think about sound also. The sound is very well done, some gun sound seem to have changed from what I remember. This isn\\'t bad though, for some weapons it makes them sound much better and then the other raises the question, \"Why did you bring a teddy bear with you to war?\" Some added features would be them pausing the game for you to plant explosives, turn a lever, or fight in hand to hand combat with those nasty Krauts. While this does break up the monotony of the linear experience it feels a bit out of place; more so the pausing to setup explosives and pull a lever than fighting Krauts.   The story itself revolves around, and too my liking, more than just the Americans, Brits, and Russians. Although the Russians have been exempt this time around let\\'s hope they make an appearance in Call of Duty 5 (they already showed in Call of Duty 4, those bastards.) So you follow storylines which follow Americans, Brits, Pols, French, and Canadians. It\\'s nice to see three countries involved in the war, although I could have sworn the Pols and French had decided to surrender when they saw Hitler\\'s mustache. Half way through the game you may realize something; it\\'s following the same campaign Company of Heroes followed. The Falsaise Pass and the cornering of Germans in Chamboise. This is very nice to see and part of me wishes that Relic and Treyarch had cooperated on both games and made the stories interlock with each other. So as usual you\\'re running around destroying flak cannons, driving tanks (which are still some of my favorite missions, and to be honest, are better in Call of Duty 3 than 2 or the original.) So Treyarch did a good job. Although they took some liberties with the series in adding a few quirks that at times don\\'t feel right, the multi-player isn\\'t worth discussing as it leaves a lot to be desired when compared to 2\\'s or 4\\'s multi-player experience. When you\\'re done playing this game you\\'ll feel a since of release and no need to replay it. That lost point is sad. Also, at times, I felt like the stories or internal conflicts between say the Pols and Canadians and Brits and French were cliché or just not done in a general tasteful or well put together fashion.   To sum this up. Call of Duty 3 isn\\'t a buy. But if you have a friend, who owns the game, then borrow it from them. Have some fun, the campaign I would venture to guess last between seven and ten hours which are decent. So if you have an itch, like me, sometimes for a World War 2 game then check this out.',\n",

       "  'description': \"With the launch of the Xbox 360 in November of 2005, Microsoft took charge in the next generation early to get the all-important head start in the console race. There weren't any amazing games that launched with the system like Wii's Twilight Princess, or the SNES' Super Mario World, but there was a lot of games that were pretty decent, and Kameo: Element of Power is one of those games. If you like past Rare games like Banjo Kazooie, or Jet Force Gemini for the Nintendo 64, then you probably like this game, but it is different than past Rare games. You'll notice right from the beginning that it will very much feel like a classic Rare game with the same type of noises and visually similar to the company's classics. The big thing that Microsoft wanted with its new system was the enhanced graphics from the previous generation. This jump was drastic, and when you switch over you system into HD, you will be amazed. But with all of this promise of enhanced graphics come with great gameplay? Kameo: Elements of Power is supposed to be this game, but does it hit the mark?\\xa0You play as a female protagonist named Kameo (surprisingly enough), infiltrating a very evil looking castle in order to save her family at the beginning of the game. Right off the first hop you can really tell the graphical difference between the original Xbox, and the Xbox 360. Fireballs are falling from the sky, which is dark and cloudy with lightning going off after every couple of seconds. Kameo is not supposed to be visiting this castle, as you may already have figured, but the beginning castle is just the tutorial of what the rest of the game will offer. You can transform into 3 different creatures, depending on what face button they're located on. For example, one of the creatures is a Plant named Pummel Weed, and if you have him equipped to the B button, pressing said button will morph Kameo into the creature selected, and in this case, she would transform into Pummel Weed. Using the face buttons for transforming into creatures can get a little annoying especially when you have to use the Left and Right Triggers to attack, and it can especially annoying when you have to press them together to do a different kind of attack.\\xa0But anyways, after Kameo arrives at her destination inside of the evil infested castle, her evil Sister releases Kameo of her special abilities, and the premise of the rest of the game is to get them back. Getting them back is never easy. Kameo will have to fight evil demons in order to gain each of the creature's power. Fighting these devilish monsters get harder and harder as the game progresses. You are also unable to use the powers you gain back from previous fights, you will always have to fight with the vulnerable Kameo herself. It is especially annoying when her kick move is done by pressing both LT and RT together, and it sometimes doesn't register both presses of the buttons. You will meet many funny characters along the way, and like previous Rare games, the whole game is hilarious with great dialog, and awesome voice acting. The Enchanted Castle floats in the sky in the middle of the over world, where everyone is safe, but it's surrounded by a magical barrier, and if it falls, so will the castle. Kameo has to protect this barrier with her life, and goblins like to attack more than she would probably like. Sometimes it's at the sea, or sometimes it's just a tank trying to take it down, but no matter what the situation is, you have to take it them down before they do.\\xa0If you have played a Zelda game before, then you're pretty much at home where Kameo is concerned. The game will have you trek through 4 different dungeon all having a different theme, like Zelda, catch my drift? The 4 themes of all of the dungeons include a Forest area, a Beach theme, an Ice dungeon, and even a goblin controlled Airship. The mention of only 4 dungeons (5 if you include the 1st castle at the start of the game) might turn people off because of the shortness of the game, and to tell the truth, the game does end up being pretty short. There are some side quests here and there, but overall, it's lacking in the length department. You do find a number of different types of creatures though, and there ends up being 10 in total with every creature having a unique ability that you will need to use for the puzzles in the game. Some are somewhat useless like Rubble for example (a ball of rocks that shoots rocks at opponents, but does minimal damage), but some are very useful like Ash (can use fire to stop enemies in their tracks). Some can be pretty useless against enemies, but can be really effective in puzzle situations. Boss fights are also pretty epic too, but some can get very frustrating at times. The second boss for example needs to have balls reflected up a ramp in order to reach him, but reflecting the balls is done with a creature that turns into ball to attack enemies, and if you're off by like a 5 degree angle, the ball will miss the target. Annoying to say the least.\\xa0An enemies health is represented by a number above their body, and when you hit them with an attack, the number will quickly go down. Most enemies wont have a giant amount of health, but they will gradually increase over the length of the game. Kameo can also find fruits that can increase her creatures attacks to have more devastating special moves that will deal more damage. The whole game isn't very difficult, and getting stuck is never an option, because Kameo carries around a book named Ortho that will always tell you what to do if you get stuck. It good for beginner players, but for more experienced players it's like a cheat. But, most of time you can figure figure out what to do, and if you eventually need to use Ortho, it'll end up being obvious what to do. You also use the book to upgrade the creatures you find throughout the game.\\xa0Visually, Kameo looks awesome. It's not going to take your breath away like Gears of War, but you will still be wowed by them. All of the environments are silky smooth and have a nice glare reflecting off of them with rich and luxurious colours found all around the game. The characters are pretty good looking, it's not supposed to be realistic, so many other characters will look very cartoonish. The frame rate also never really hitches, but it's not totally smooth, it can hiccup here and there. Since the 360 is so powerful, Kameo is able to have a ridiculous amount of enemies on the screen. Sometimes when you're riding your horse, you can end up going through a massive line of goblins and there will be hardly any slowdown. The sound is also pretty good, though, it's not amazing. The voice acting, like mentioned above, is great, and the soundtrack also sounds pretty epic. The old Rare sounds from previous generations are also back, and they still sound satisfying enough. Enemies and other characters will have some pretty cartoony voices with grunts and screams can sound kind of cute.\\xa0Overall, Kameo: Elements of Power is a decent game. It's not going to blow you away in any area of the game, but not many launch games are supposed to. Kameo tries to do a lot of things differently like using the trigger buttons for attacking, but it really doesn't end up being very good, especially when you have to press them together. The game is beautiful with rich colours, and silky smooth environments, and the sound is pretty good too, but the game is short and doesn't take very long to finish. With a good area, comes a bad area. That's the story with Kameo. It can be great in some areas, but not in others. Kameo is a great first try by Rare for the Xbox 360, and if it was near the beginning of the 360's lifecycle, I'd suggest it. But since it's 3 years into the 360's life, I suggest to just pass on it if you haven't yet played it.\",\n",

The new tracks are really well designed with fun environments and multiple pathways. The online works surprisingly well seeing as Smash Bros online was a complete lag fest sloppy mess. The controls are still as solid as they ever were so there is no problem there.Where I do fault the game is what I kind of gave it props to as well. The game has been toned down for the casual players, so fans of the series will probably see this more of a step back rather than a step forward.

       "  'description': 'Every few years we get a game that truly demonstrates what art is? A game that truly shows that our medium isn’t about just entertainment and providing a creative outlet; to me that is the definition of art though. If you look at games such as System Shock 2, Half-Life 2, and the original Deus Ex those are all art. How do you collectively add everything from graphics, sound, atmosphere, and actual literary storytelling into a game though? Most people these days see it as a waste of time and nothing but glorified killing. You could say that about the army, nothing but glorified killing that is supposedly going to secure peace…but I digress. This game will do more than pull you in; this game will become your past time. I find it hard for me to quit playing even when I’ve got homework to do for my AP Classes. We’ll start with the usual, what is the story? Not to give too much away your character begins this game on a plane ride over the Atlantic Ocean. The plane itself crashes during flight and you are now stranded in the Mid-Atlantic with fire ablaze around you and water. Lots of beautiful water. According to Ken Levine, the mastermind at what was once Irrational (now 2K Boston) his artist spent 3 years on getting the water just right, and it shows. As you swim through the water you see reflections of yourself, fire and oh! A lighthouse. Not a lighthouse you would see off the coast of Nantucket mind you, a utopia industrial looking light house. Since it really is the only ground near you must obviously swim to it (look at the plane as you swim, it’s actually sinking into the ocean, marvelous detail!) Once in the lighthouse the lights within will automatically turn on and a sign will read “No Gods or Kings. Only Man!” Any book worm or dystopia intellectual can figure out right away where inspiration for the story in this game comes from. Look at writer’s such as Ayn Rand (Atlas Shrugged) and Huxley (Brave New World) and you will know what I’m talking about. I will say this, the story is interesting and worth listening to the monologues of the various citizens of Rapture and your ultimate dystopian Antagonist Andrew Ryan (leader of Rapture) to gain insight about what Rapture is all about what it has become. The story itself leads to climaxes then turns into another direction to keep you thinking all the time.  Rapture is the name of the city which is a city built below the Ocean. There people of only a certain caliber of intellect are allowed to go there and do studies and live as they please based off the ideal of objectiveness. (Look up Ayn Rand and Objectivism for more info.) As you enter you will notice a very different art style than other games made with the Unreal 3 Engine. It’s a 1950s-60s art deco style that is very polished, detailed, and makes it feel that more authentic. As you start out when emerging from your underwater metro you will see the first Spider Splicer in the game. You won’t kill it just yet, as it will kill a friend of Atlas. Atlas is the first person and one the main people you will work with in your adventure through Rapture. As the game progresses you will learn more about every character’s ideals and their goals, confusing at best and at times…not based on morals. In the game you have your usual guns, pistol, machine gun, shot gun. Then you’ve got a chemical gun, a cross-bow, and a rocket launcher. All of these can be customized with 3 different types of ammo and upgraded to perform better and faster. Better and faster is what we want, right? Right! To get away from the mundane cliches of a shooter you also get Plasmids, Gene Tonics, Physical Tonics, and other unique tonics to improve your character. Some plasmids you get are Incinerate, electrobolt, and Attacking Bees! Some of these are more useful than others, like attacking bees is just funny to watch while incinerate and electrobolt will allow you to come up with some very useful ways of killing multiple enemies. Such as, say there’s a big pool of water and there are 3 splicer’s (the most common enemy) and you shoot electrobolt at the water. If you know anything about water and electricity you know anything living standing in that water will die. Looking at how the tonics and plasmids change your Character’s genetic code is one for the books and something really lets this game standout from the rest. What other games makes you think and chose your next action to better counter something? What other game understands the laws of science and intellectual utopias that melt into a dystopia. In all honesty I could write an essay on how this game finally proves that video games aren’t mindless violent. If you look at allusions to the bible this game has, Eve which is what powers your plasmids and Adam which is the currency that makes eve you understand the brain power put into this game. If you look at Andrew Ryan and other Character’s names in this game that come from the dystopian fiction writing of Ayn Rand you will understand this game beyond the teenage high-school book worms do. You will understand this game better than someone that has played FPS game’s all their lives. An FPS/RPG Hybrid (RPG because you collect stuff I suppose.) that finally adds everything from atmosphere, sound, music, ambiance, graphics, and art direction into a literary and mind indulging masterpiece. Besides a few bugs and 2K’s horrendous online verification (they should have had Valve help them with verification.) this game stands up to legends such as Half-Life 2 and Deus Ex. Perhaps it’s biggest accomplishment other than being a work of art in all respects is the fact that it lives up as the spiritual follower of System Shock 2.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Black is the first, first person shooter (FPS) from Criterion Games and EA, it does a lot of things really well but lacks in the depth department and wears thin after it\\'s all said and done. The story of Black puts you in the shoes of Sgt First Class, Jack Keller. When the game first starts you have been put in custody for an apparent mission gone wrong and are being debriefed by this stereotypical military \"suit\" character (who also has the gruff typical voice to match) and the story, if you can call it that, plays out through these FMV cut scenes full of military jargon that you can barely comprehend, so even when the game is telling you what is going on you can\\'t understand anyways. But the idea is there is this ex-agent called Lennox who is now commanding this terrorist group called Seventh Wave and your mission was to take him out.  That\\'s pretty much it for story, the missions are the meat of the game anyway so it\\'s a bit inconsequential. Once you are in the missions things usually heat up really quickly and you get pitted against hoards of armed soldiers and must usually simply make your way to the end of level. On medium to hard you must also collect a few simple secondary objectives which require you to shoot a lap-top or a safe and find objects like blueprints, briefcases and folders full of super secret stuff. These are just put there to force you to not just head for the end of the level, they aren\\'t really interesting, so are tricky to find, but they don\\'t really add to the experience. Of course shooting and destroying is the name of the game and you\\'ll be doing a lot of shooting and destroying as you make your way through the game\\'s eight levels.  The thing is the shooting is basically the jest of it; you either shoot like crazy or go for headshots. The latter being the option of choice in Black because it kills most enemies in one hit. Because of that most of the battles boil down to staying behind cover (contrary to popular belief, being out in the open in Black is actually bad) and trying for head shots, rinse and repeat for basically all the game\\'s firefights. In fact the levels are designed to keep you from moving through quickly by putting you into one progress stopping firefight after another. Probably the most annoying things is that even the basic soldiers must be taken down with headshots, because they simply take way too many bullets to kill otherwise. Even with good body armor, getting hit with 27 AK-47 rounds is going to take you down easily. The enemies end up feeling superhuman and less like real people and because of the realistic look of the game makes you question the reality of the world you are playing in.  The simple play mechanics continue on with the other types of soldiers as well, the Shotgun carrying, mask wearing enemies in the game can literally take 2 clips of 60+ bullets to kill with body shots. You soon realize that they need to be taken down with quick headshots (it takes about three, one or two to knock off the mask and a final one to take them down) or using the Grenade-shooting tactic. This little move, where you quickly shoot a thrown grenade will get you through most of the game and becomes key when fighting the other soldier type, the shields. These guys have metal or plastic riot-shields and it protects them from direct shots while allowing them to blast you.  The level design is okay, but they are mostly linear with those firefights thrown in to keep you from just \"running the gauntlet\" to the end of the level. They mostly consist of industrial, factory and derelict buildings but they look like full blown action movie set pieces and are cool otherwise. The thing that isn\\'t really appealing is how as you play through the game the number of enemies you start to face gets mighty unreal and to be frank, plain ridiculously out of control. The game tries to go for this old school feel with thousands of enemies to wipe out, similar to classic games like Contra (NES) or even something like Doom on the PC, but because of the realistic look and feel, that just seems fake here. It doesn\\'t matter how \"First Class\" and deadly Sgt. Keller is he isn\\'t going to \"one-man army\" it all the way through any of the missions, especially not the later ones. The final poor thing about the level design is the length of the missions themselves, the first mission will take 10-15 minutes, but after that expect it to take 30 minutes to an hour to get through most of the missions, but that isn\\'t the bad thing in and of itself. The true culprit is the fact that the game uses a checkpoint system at set points in the level. They are about 2 or 3 in each level and can be spaced up to 15 minutes apart, so if you do die, then you sometimes get set back upwards of 15 minutes, which really sucks. Being able to save and quit at the checkpoints would have been a nice feature and a few of the levels could used a few more.  The graphics in Black are among the best you can find on the PS2, with spectacular explosions, cool lighting effects and amazing details that are a Criterion specialty. Without spoiling some of the best moments, pretty much everything can be taken out, they are specific, but there are so many of them that you won\\'t notice that you can\\'t destroy everything. Bullets for instance sometimes make so much dust from impacts that you can\\'t see across the room anymore, only the muzzle flash of your opponents tip you off to where they are located. One of the coolest and at the same time most annoying is the depth of field affect that blurs the background when you are focused on reloading your weapon. It\\'s neat at first, but the first time you are blinded by it during a fight, you wish it wasn\\'t there. The guns themselves look really great and the behave in a realistic manner, Autos have recoil that forces your aim of the weapon up so controlling your fire rate is important. Since we\\'re on the subject of the guns, I should mention that quite a few of the guns in Black are useless except as keys or to throw away as soon as a better gun gets dropped. Stuff like the Mac-10 and the standard pistol are useless because you need to mostly fight from long-range and the Shotgun and RPG usually are only good as keys to opening blocked doors.  The sound in Black is another one of the games best aspects, the sound of bullets whizzing around and ricocheting off walls sound really great. If you aren\\'t hearing booming explosions, you will learn to detect the sounds of a few particular guns; the whoosh of a RPG round or the cracking sniper rifle shot. There are a few satisfying sounds that aren\\'t from weapons, the plink of a headshot soldiers helmet tells you that you \"got him,\" and the sound of a body slumping to the ground help you know you got your target. The soldiers also yell at you in another language, you\\'ll have no idea what they are saying (other than the universal: \"Grenada!!\"), but you will know that they have seen you if they say something. Your character also has some radio chatter, but he yells way too loud, especially when he is trying to be covert. In a few levels you also have team-mates that yell stuff at you about RPG\\'s, putting on suppressors or what you should being doing. I also should mention that a lot of this radio chatter contains most of the swearing that is featured in the game.  In the end, Black will take you 6-8 hours to finish, if the shallow gameplay doesn\\'t get to you first. This game would make a perfect rental; you could easily beat it within that time. Criterion\\'s first effort was pretty decent, but lacks any kind of replay value (no multiplayer and very low amount of unlockables), it\\'s not even that great to play through again, because of the awkward level design. With that said it is recommended that you at least give Black a try in the end.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime has one of those titles that tells you nothing about the game. At first you think its an RPG since it has the Dragon Quest franchise title. But in the end it's really an action/adventure game in the same style as the Zelda series. Then you have Rocket Slime. Which out of the game it makes no sense. Rocket Slime is the kind of game that you have to play to understand.  The game starts out with a little Slime named Rocket. Rocket and his friends are screwing around when a race of duck creatures attack, destroy the village, and take all 100 of the other Slimes including your family. It is your mission to rescue them and restore the town to its former beauty.  While on your mission you will use your stretching powers to attack and pick up enemies. items, and Slimes that you will need to take back to your village. The game is very forgiving and places carts that return to the village for you. A very nice touch that makes the game far less frustrating than it could have been. Taking these items back to town will add items to your stockpile of ammo for what becomes the major combat element in the game. Tank battles. These tank battles consist of you and 3 other teammates throwing items (each having specific abilities and power) at the opposing tank. First to reach 0 hp has their weakness exposed and you now have the chance to destroy it by infiltrating their tank. It's a very interesting concept that works very well. There are so many different things to do and items to find and synthesize that anyone who plays will have a different strategy.  That leads us to the multiplayer. The game supports up to 4 players for a 2 on 2 team tank battle. With over 20 tanks to choose from and ways to make the games more even this has to be one of the most underlooked multiplayer games out there.  Overall Dragon Quest Heroes is a very unique game that everyone with a DS should try out. It combines the greatest aspects of Zelda with fun RPG strategy that has just enough action where anyone can enjoy it. Your getting a minimum of 17 hours of gameplay for the single player and over 25 if you wan't to get everything. Plus don't forget the multiplayer.  PROS + Addictive gameplay + Tank battles are great + Good music and sound + Multiplayer is awesome+ Funny and unique translation + Lengthy quest  CONS - Becomes nothing but tank battles at some point - Would have been nice to see some touch screen support - Is a little too easy\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Six long years. It took six years for GSC of Russia to turn S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Shadow of Chernobyl (referred to as stalker for the rest of this review) into a playable form. Of course there are some bugs in the game, but should we really expect any game to be bug free, even if it has been in development for six years; no. The game introduces you to your scenario with a very high quality cinematic, which exposes who your character is. Apparently you fell out of a “death truck” when it was hit by lighting and you are found by another Stalker who takes you to a fat ogre for payment. I call him the fat ogre, in reality he is your lovable Russian with sarcastic remarks and a lust for money. Anyways, you are thrown on a table in front of the fat ogre and he starts looking for your PDA. Needles to say he finds it and you, the alive-dead character on the table reaches out and grabs it, you have a tattoo with the words S.T.A.L.K.E.R on your arm. Which allows you to be deemed the “Marked One” by the fat ogre, because apparently you have amnesia; his cure for this is to keep you busy. The main mission of this game is to find Strelok, a stalker whom disappeared a while back according to the ogre. Along with main missions, there are side missions, but since there is no incentive to perform on these tasks, you may never touch them. Although, a few are actually forced onto you, such as helping to protect a camp from bandits, which if you succeed all you really get is money. While the game isn’t linear, because you can go off, do all the side missions, and never touch the main story, the story missions themselves are on the rails but the train can be derailed. So, needless to say that in this immersive world nothing is linear, but sadly you never need to touch the side missions to have an exhilarating time. Now these missions, especially the main story can become frustrating with how well Stalker’s Radiant AI system works. Realism seemed to be key in their development when it came to how many bullets it takes to kill someone and where the most destructive “hit boxes” are located. Aim for the head, you won’t be disappointed. Enemies in this game, become far and wide as you face the military, bandits, rabid dogs, pseudo-dogs, pseudo-giants, snarks, poltergeist, rodent, flesh, and bloodsuckers. Encountering a bloodsucker is probably the most terrifying thing in this game, they have the ability to turn invisible and some can use psycho mind tricks that will mess with your visions and brain. I found it easy to kill them if you look for their eyes while their invisible and pump two or four shots of from the shotgun right in-between them. Most of these animals, other than the poltergeist, bloodsuckers, and snarks are relatively harmless. The human enemies though, paired with Radiant AI, just as the animals are, will give you a tough time if you aren’t aiming for the head. By the end of the game, you will have encountered everything since you have to travel deep into the heart of Chernobyl just to beat the main story. To kill enemies you need weapons, weapons such as guns and grenades. You can only have four weapons and binoculars equipped and ready to use at all times. You have a knife, a pistol, your choice of shotgun or smg(which ever one you prefer when you find it), and grenades. Your friend will become the shotgun, smg, and pistol. While I did find the grenades useful to clear out groups of bandits, it never came in handy much. The rule stays the same for all weapons, including the knife, aim for the head and the enemy will go down fast…just like real life. I haven’t talked much about graphics, usually the first thing I delve into with reviews. Here is the reason why, we know they are dated; they wouldn’t be superb anyways because of the size of levels, and three details and lighting make up for it. That’s right folks, this game has high detail and paired with HDR and other lighting effects it will turn this bleak Chernobyl into a sometimes mutated fairy-tale. Now, on the internet people have been complaining that this game isn’t very pretty; well it won’t be pretty because you are playing in a nuclear wasteland set in and around Chernobyl. Although, this game will cause even the best of computers to become slow at times and buckle under the attention to immersion and lighting in this game. Here is a scenario, say your traversing the harsh radiated landscape at night and it begins to rain. You see the rain and you hear the thunder along with chirping of mutated birds and insects. The thunder intensifies lighting a coming, boom you hear and see the lighting and the whole world around you lights up. Here is why this game can bring even the best computer down to its knees, the attention to detail doesn’t include just textures, it includes atmosphere of the game, which is superb beyond all expectations. Two things have yet to been discussed, artifacts and anomalies. Artifacts are essentially radiated pieces of earth or metal that now holds a form of value. The value of these ranges from very low to very high depending on the rarity. How greedy are you? Ask yourself this because, either you can go through a trader who will get some profit from this, or, you can sell directly to a scientist in the area, which brings in more RU’s for you. The game does use the official currency of Russia. Now anomalies are exactly what the definition says, “n odd, peculiar, or strange condition, situation, quality, etc.” In this case, they are random spots in and around the zone that will cause harm to anything that walks in their wake. There are four different types, lighting, bubbling green that causes severe blood loss, burner, and vortex. A few of these anomalies actually move on the ground such as lighting and burner. Others such as bubbly green and vortex are stationary and have life spans. These two things are related, if there are many anomalies around there is or some artifacts around. Around the bubbly green, I found “fuzzy” which looks like a big brown fuzz ball. You know the core of the game now, game play itself is more realistic than un realistoc because of the ballistics system used. Did you know gravity affects bullets? Apparently, many shooters don’t understand this, but stalker does. Don’t go around thinking you will be able to snipe someone with a pistol or smg; they all have realistic ranges. As you make your way through the zone and into Chernobyl itself, the nuclear power plant that blew up years ago, you will be scared and at times happy. Immersion in this game was a goal; they achieved that goal not through graphics but through attention to atmospheric detail. Along with random stalker’s and other characters that go about their lives thanks to the Radiant AI system, so do animals, but the humans get to speak in Russian that no one understands. Voice acting isn’t the best, then again who cares when you have a game this phenomenal on your hard drive. I would write more, describe more, and praise the game until I die, but I want to get back to the Zone and have some fun. The game is designed like an RPG in some ways; you will find upgrades for your weapons, like I found a silencer for both my AK and my pistol. You also have an inventory, which you can only hold up to fifty pounds at the start. The inventory is of course where you will conduct trading deals along with checking your reservoir of ammo and health packs. Eating isn’t priority in the game, but is needed at times when you’re low on health and need a caffeine boost. Talking with characters isn’t the most exciting thing unless your listening to their Russian gibberish, then it is rather enjoyable. The RPG side of the game isn’t as expanded as most people, but from a first person lover it is a wonderful addition that won’t slow you down. Before I do that, multiplayer should probably be discussed along with a few bugs. Multiplayer is a bust, it won’t be the new thing but it is fun for a while. Like in Counter-Strike you buy weapons, grenades, helmets, protective vest and what not. Thanks to realistic bullets, though only snipers can snipe and smg’s can sometimes pull off a pop head shot. It’s not fast paced and the system doesn’t feel very well balanced. It seems like the developers through it together at the last minute and tacked it on to their wonderful single player experience. The bugs in the game are things such as NPC’s clipping through walls and the game sometimes not starting up. This can be fixed with a reinstall though and you don’t lose your save games. I’m saying that from experience. Overall the game is gorgeous, in a radiated mutated way and it is one of the most immersive games that can compete in not just a shooting experience, but horror also. If you’re a PC gamer, you need to go pick this game up. Did I mention that some character play guitar and that Vodka reduces radiation?',\n",

       "  'description': \"The first Guitar Hero was a dream come true for me. I had always loved the Konami series Guitar Freaks in the arcade, and I was hoping for a US version which of course never came to be. I followed Guitar Hero from it's E3 showing until release and loved every minute of it. Naturally a sequel was announced and again I was excited. Now that the game is out the reality sets in. After one year what else could I expect, but more of the same?  Guitar Hero II is a solid game. Better than the original in many respects. But sadly it just isn't as big of a leap as one would hope. You still have the single player venue to venue cross country mode. This time with even crazier venues and a great sense of presentation. The graphics have been pumped up, and the animations are some of the out there, but really it's just all pretty pictures. There is no depth in to the single player which makes the fun in the game fall solely on the shoulders of the track list. On the whole GH2's songs just aren't as good as the originals. Going through the single player to unlock the songs becomes a lesson in disappointment. You play your heart out hoping for a great new song only to get something average. That's not to say there aren't some good ones. There are in fact some amazing songs.  One of the best new features in the game is the practice mode. For the people out there like me who go crazy when they get to the end of a perfect run only to miss one note in the only tricky part of the song there is a Practice Mode. In this mode you can select the section of the song and even the speed at which you want to play it. It's a very nice addition that makes the game less frustrating then it could be.  Naturally there is the multiplayer mode which made the first game so popular. On paper GH2 has some great new multiplayer modes. There is the traditional dueling guitars play, and a new co-op mode which allows for someone to play guitar and someone to play bass or rhythm. This new mode is a great idea, but most of the songs bass parts are uneventful. However when you do play the songs that take full advantage it's a hell of a time. The best new mode is the most simple of them all. The Pro-Duel mode is just both players playing the same notes at the same time. Which should have been in the original.  It may sound like I dislike GHII. It's just that playing the same game not even a year later isn't something I wanted to do. If you loved Guitar Hero you may end up loving GH2. It's a quality game that just trys to be a little too safe for its own good.  PROS + Practice Mode + Fun sense of style and presentation + Very nice graphics and animations + Same great gameplay  CONS - Track List is love it or hate it - Single Player needs something new - Same gameplay\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Most of us love shooting enemies with the Spaz-12 or the PS90 in our favorite first-person shooters such as Counter-Strike and Half-Life 2. Do we ever enjoy first-person melee combat though? Oblivion failed at providing a non-autistic form of first-person melee combat (FPM), which would lead some to believe that it couldn’t be done if Bethesda couldn’t pull of FPM. Conclusions, although decisive never really give us the truth. The truth, well Bethesda turned fighting with swords in the first person into an autistic upbeat laughable paradigm while Arkane turned it into an enjoyable pleasure, it may just replace masturbation Arkane studios, if you have heard of them or not all you need to know is that even though Dark Messiah of Might and Magic got horrible initial reviews, a few months later it is a great game. After an initial scare of computers breaking with this game because of its buggy release, everything seems to be in order, except for a frame rate issue. Built on the source engine; hence the mention of HL2 and CS, we can finally see what can be done with talents beyond valve; they are breathtaking. The implementation of HDR and new textures brings the game to life as you kill orcs, goblins, and dragons. Talking about graphics in this game would be like talking about the hotness of Keira Knightly or some other Hollywood babe; we already know they/it is pretty. Which leaves us to some pondering: What is so great about this game? Well, the story line while cliche at times (but what isn’t now a days) will engross you into the games world and may make you love the devil inside your head or the blond trying to court you. Narrated by you, Sareth, your goal is unknown until about the last few levels. This isn’t bad, as most people would think, it allows paranoia and for you to actually use your brain to figure out the plot. While it is predictable, the story is about as engrossing and entertaining as the book Eragon. I won’t leave much about the plot in this review; you should be interested in finding out if you are the Dark Messiah. This review could talk about sound quality of the game, but I’d rather not. That is to be expected from a game using the Source engine. A lot is expected from this game because it is the Source engine, and well, most of the time it lives up to it. Some issues would be the low frame rates you can get on a high-end system and all the initial bugs that made this even worse at release. After fixing it we can come back and look at the beautiful lush landscapes and caverns Arkane was able to make. The true thrill of the game is finding some of the coolest weapons and killing orcs, and goblins, and necromancers with them. In one portion of the game I found some lightning daggers, which became my favorite, I ran around stabbing Orcs in the back; a skill you can acquire among many others. You will find soon though, that the best weapons you may never use because there are so many different combination, permutations that you can choose. After fixing the bugs, Dark Messiah finally stands out as the game it should be. A tale from a long remembered series that gives you the choice of good and evil and inserts that formula into a beautiful world only the medieval thoughts could deliver. There is a multiplayer aspect to this game, yet, it falls short from the quality of single player. I played for about thirty minutes before I was bored and decided to play BF2142. The game doesn’t lend itself well to that aspect, while castle siege is fun; there isn’t much organization of the multiplayer portion of this romp through the world of Might and Magic. If you dodged this game because of initial reviews, look at it again and I think you will change your mind. The intense melee fighting should be enough to pick this one up.',\n",

       "  'description': \"(Originally posted on GameSpot.com under the name stevenscott14. Appears here slightly edited due to my perfectionist state of mind.)I'm sure everybody has heard of Starcraft - without a doubt one of the most influential PC games ever and one of the greatest examples of strategy-based gaming to this day. It's a game that has captivated thousands, maybe millions, since its release, so much that many people are still playing it today, whether over Blizzard's servers on Battle.net, or simply experimenting with their own offline custom games and making their own maps with the superb scenario editor.  And it deserves all the attention, to say the least. Starcraft shines in all areas, even the graphics can impress to this day. Maybe not in the technical aspect, but in the artistic stakes, and in the way that the visuals leak charisma and charm, Starcraft succeeds, almost nine years later. And, yes, even nine years later, the gameplay still obliterates the majority of strategy games being released today. Starcraft is, in my eyes, and in a lot of other people's eyes, a benchmark for the genre. The game presents you with three races to play as: the Terran marines, our digital human counterparts, who are an ideal place to start with their perfect balance between all of their units and characteristics; the Zerg alien race, who rely on mass quantities of cheaper, throwaway units, and whose structures and units all evolve from larvae; and the Protoss tribes, a technologically advanced species who employ smaller amounts of more expensive, enhanced units.  The balance between these three races is truly something to behold. Whereas in most games, intense competitions online may end in sore losers complaining that the opposition had a particular ability that put them at an advantage, in Starcraft, there is really no excuse for that sort of thing. Each race is almost perfectly balanced so that no single one of them outweighs any of the others.  Each race are equally charming, fun to use, and just all-around great fun - the Terran maintain a charismatic hardass attitude all the time, whether it's from the marines' sometimes suicidal outlook on the war ('you want a piece of me, boy' doesn't sound too good when a lone marine is faced with a Protoss carrier) from the Zerg's disgusting biological squelchings and alien gruntings ('kaablargh' must intimidate the other races somehow') or from the Protoss' kickass psychic abilities and robotic hummings and such.More importantly, the core mechanics of the game are golden and almost perfect, again. The game revolves around your worker units harvesting minerals and Vespene gas in order for you to build structures, move through a technology tree, and implement more and more units in your forces as they become available. This stays true for all races, but there are slight alterations. For the Terrans, your SCV workers will gather minerals and they will also build the structures, and your units will enter battle from these structures, for instance a starport will construct Wraith fighters and Battlecruisers. For the Zerg, all structures are biological, as such the workers, (Drones) will actually mutate into your buildings and larvae will mutate into the Drones. It's slightly more complicated than the Terran, but when you get it sussed out it's an equally rewarding chain. The Protoss are possibly even more complicated than that, as all buildings seem to enter through warp rifts in hyperspace, and your workers (Probes) will open up these rifts. All buildings have to be powered by a structure called a Pylon, too.Now I'm going into more of a walkthrough rather than a review, so I'll snap out of it. The point comes down to this - the concept of Starcraft really works, and almost every aspect of its execution is topnotch. There are a few annoying flaws, such as units randomly following enemy units, a few gaps in enemy AI, but they are just minor, as for the most part, Blizzard built a rock solid foundation for this game nine years ago and it still hasn't been shattered by a superior game as far as I know.  And the storyline and plot haven't been surpassed, either - the voice-overs in the game are almost perfect and the characters deliver the tale astonishingly well. Blizzard always implement great stories into their games, and Starcraft has possibly been blessed with their best work. It's sometimes surprising, sometimes emotionally charged, sometimes inspiring, and sometimes just plain epic, but it never fails to stray from an incredible core science fiction narrative.  The graphics, as I've said, fit the game like a glove, and reek charisma and personality from every single pore, and even nine years later they truly do shine; even if the game does look rather dated it really doesn't matter when the visuals have this much personality. The audio, however, is even better.  Blizzard have always been pioneers of game music in my eyes, and Starcraft is a true testament to that.  Some people may point out that the music is maybe a bit over the top or maybe a bit odd, but the diversity between the three race's music is obvious, and every single track will stick in your head like some sort of glue. The Terran have a sort of weird infectious poppy vibe everywhere, the Zerg get a rather spooky, ambient selection, and the Protoss music cannot really be explained with words. The voice-overs in the game that document the story are again completely and utterly at the top of their field. The assorted sound effects and responses from the units in the game really have a sense of personality, too, especially the Zerg squelchings and battle cries.  All in all, Starcraft is destined to be remembered as a piece of videogaming history, that is if it isn't already. Everybody has to play this game, and I shall be staggered if there is somebody out there who doesn't find anything to enjoy about this incredibly well designed game.  Starcraft truly is a spellbinding, glittering example of real time strategy gaming, and it should be experienced by absolutely everybody, whether it's to witness an almost perfect RTS, behold an unbelievable storyline, or see the topnotch balance between three of the finest races in videogaming history. It's just an amazing game. Simple as that.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'When Capcom first announced that they were making an exclusive Resident Evil game for Nintendo’s new console, I was very happy. Everyone was speculating on what the game will be about, and how it would play. Most people thought that they were going to stick with the new formula created in Resident Evil 4 with the camera behind the character’s back, and aiming where ever you wanted to. Well, that didn’t quite happen. Capcom decided to go with a more ‘casual’ approach with Umbrella Chronicles, and decided to make it an on-rails shooter, ala House of the Dead. Every Resident Evil fan, and even Wii owners where sadly disappointed with this horrible news. Capcom could have went with an awesome idea, and made the game the best game for the Wii yet, but they went for the stupid ‘casual’ idea, and it didn’t turn out well... At all. In fact, Umbrella Chronicles is no doubt the worst Resident Evil game to date.\\xa0The Umbrella Chronicles tells the story of the whole Resident Evil franchise in 4 separate chapters. You start with Resident Evil 0 where a S.T.A.R.S. Bravo team member Rebecca Chambers, hunts down a murderer Billy Cowan, to take him to jail. As it turns out, they get into a sticky mess with Zombies and Leaches investing a train where they meet. The second chapter is from the original Resident Evil where you are Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine (both S.T.A.R.S. Alpha Team members) trying to escape from the Mansion in the middle of the forest. The 3rd chapter is Jill and Carlos Oliveira, an Umbrella soldier trying to rescue civilians, trying to escape from the torment and destruction of Raccoon City. The 3rd chapter is stupidly messed up though. First of all, Jill and Carlos go places where Resident Evil 3 didn’t even take place. They meet somewhere totally different, and most of the places you go are from Resident Evil: Outbreak File # 1 & 2. The fourth chapter is Chris and Jill (again), but this time they go to Russia to try and uncover Umbrella’s secrets and to stop Wesker once and for all.\\xa0Sadly, there’s no Resident Evil 2, Code Veronica, or 4 scenarios, which is a damn shame. Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield aren’t even in the game to begin with. This is where the game tends to be, no very good. First of all, there’s only four chapters, which could have easily been seven. There are only 3 levels in each chapter, and they go by very quickly. But, there is a rating system in the game which can make you come back and redo old chapters. You get rated on your quickness, how many enemies you killed, how many critical hits you got, and on how many breakable items you destroy. You earn stars after you complete a level, and you can upgrade your weapons you collect with them. This also adds a little RPG elements to the game, but it’s nothing big at all, and you can upgrade your weaker weapons, then find a more powerful weapon in the next chapter. Just stupid.\\xa0The game is an on-rails shooter, just like in House of the Dead, just not as fun. You use the Wii Remote to aim your ridicule on the screen, and you use the Nunchuk’s analog stick to look around. Firing is used the B button and A is your action button. You can reload by shaking your Wii Remote, and you can use your knife by holding down the A button and swinging the remote. The knife is useful during some situations, but isn’t fun to use. In fact, it’s annoying. Shooting enemies is usually satisfying, but sometimes they have absolutely no response when they get shot, like nothing even hit them. Why this happens, I don’t know, but it’s irritating, and I don’t like it. Changing your weapons is as easy as pressing down or up on the Wii Remote’s D-Pad. You can pick things up in the level by aiming at them and pressing the A button. Picking up Herbs is ridiculous though because when you pick it up, you use it right away. Collecting a First-Aid spray is different though. When you collect, an image of it appears on the bottom of the screen. Then, when you die, it uses it and you recover.\\xa0You health metre is a bar across the top of the screen. And while playing 2 player co-op, you share the metre. Sharing the metre is also stupid, since one of you might not be good at the game and will make the other player die because you share the same health. It can be better in some situations, don’t get me wrong, but there should be at least another option. You can shoot almost everything in the levels you go to. Shooting certain things like lights and painting can sometimes reveal items like files and weapons. Shooting as much things as you can is really fun, because your pistol always has unlimited ammo, so you can never run out. The other weapons like the Shotgun, Machine Gun, and Rocket Launcher don’t have unlimited ammo though, but it makes perfect sense. The way you see how much ammo you have left is also an annoyance. Your ridicule has a bar around it, and when you use ammo, it decreases. The colour and the size of the bar is really difficult to see however, and can annoy the crap out of you. You can also use grenades by holding the A button, and pressing the B button. Grenades are really useful, but there are barely any of them to find.\\xa0There are a couple of ways to make yourself go back to some levels, like the rating system mentioned above, but there are also some parts where you can choose a certain path. Example, in the Russia area, there is a part where you can either go into the sewers, or up the stairs. Each part have something different then the other part. But you’re totally just guessing on where the best place to go, and sometimes it can be the wrong choice. There are also tons of enemies in the game ranging from Zombies, to Licker, to Bees, and to Hunters. There’s also a boss at the end of each chapter, and some of them are really quite difficult. All of the bosses are bosses you know, except the final boss in the Russian area, which is a giant disappointment.\\xa0The two player co-op is probably the best part of the game though, because you work together instead of by yourself. It can get irritating though when your friend or your brother starts using the shotgun on Zombies but you saved the ammo for a while for the boss of each level. It’s also annoying when you can’t see what the item is and your friend takes it, but you need it instead. Example, your friend has 5 grenades, and you have 0. Your friend sees an item flashing and takes it, and it so happens to be a grenade, which you desperately need. Before each level you can pick which gun you want, and the difficulty you want to play on. The easiest difficulty is pretty hard, and the harder difficulties put you through hell. Mix the difficulty in with some annoying puking Zombies, and no reaction when shooting them, you’ll have a frustrating time.\\xa0The visual presentation of the Umbrella Chronicles isn’t that special either, especially when it looks worse than Resident Evil 4, and Resident Evil 0 for the Gamecube. Capcom probably spent way too much time making all of the destructible items in each level, that they didn’t have enough time to smooth the graphics out. It’s not to say that it’s the worst looking Wii game yet, because it’s not. It’s actually one of the best looking, which is a shame, really. The audio isn’t very special either. There’s always a tune in the background while playing, but can sometimes, no, always take away from the atmosphere Resident Evil games are supposed to have. The sounds are impressive though with the guns sounding realistic, and Zombies sounding like... Well, the ways they’re supposed to sound. The voice acting is absolutely abysmal though. If you can compare it to the original Resident Evil, then it has to be pretty bad. Carlos for instance is supposed to sound like a Mexican, but sounds like a true American... Stupid.\\xa0Overall, Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles is fun, but nothing special. The best way to play it is with a friend with co-op, but even that isn’t very fun. The graphics are pretty average, the music is bad, and whole game is just a total disappointment. Capcom could have made a great game, one that could be remembered for generations, like Resident Evil 4. Instead they made an average on-rails shooter than could have been so much more. Umbrella Chronicles is no doubt the worst Resident Evil game to date. Bring on Resident Evil 5 already.\\xa0',\n",

       "  'description': 'Last year, in the some what late fall I went out and sold my Xbox and everything I had that had to do with my Xbox. Why? I sold it all in order to purchase two much anticipated pc games; both of which I might add were well received by the gaming community. Those games were Call of Duty 2 and F.E.A.R. Have you not heard of F.E.A.R? Well then, let me tell you, “You all deserve to die.” Extraction Point is the not much anticipated expansion pack to F.E.A.R and the gaming community didn’t receive it as well as the original. Extraction Point of course includes the fast-paced kinetic firefights from F.E.A.R along with some much needed, pant-pissing, mouth drooling, hair pulling, eyes widening moments of disgust, despair, and fear. TimeGate Studios, the team responsible for the expansion, knew what it could add and improve on which is giving us more of the same. TimeGate seems to have proven itself in continuing the fear experience by incorporating every Japanese Horror Film cliche in the book while improving just how much you will jump with the randomness of when these pant-pissing moments occur. Now here is a very watered-down version of the back-story to this game. You are one of two sons to a woman named Alma, her sons were taken away, she got mad, and she died. One of her sons, Fettel, wants to avenge her mother and take you down with him and her. In addition, its hell, which hell is war. It is assumed you know all this, because well, you need the first game to be able to install this game so…play them in order. Not much story is told though, in-fact, more questions are implied than answers and sometimes it is just confusing and you’ll want to wonder why they made this game. Without any real continuation of the amazing plot with twist and turns like the original what is the point? Graphics and sound are of-course amazing in this just as the first and if you want the full ambient visceral feel of the game play in the middle of night with all the lights off, windows and doors locked, and the volume all the way up. You’ll be in for a ride of your life that no Horror game has ever been able to deliver before this. With the addition of I believe 2 new weapons and some new enemies it really adds to the value. While the two new weapons; mini-gun and same odd rail gun are more of let downs than added fun. The two or four new enemies provide some more intense drama as you try to defeat them with your already assorted array of guns and grenades. Like the first game though, you will use really only two of your guns and two types of grenades. Over all, F.E.A.R Extraction Point is more of the same F.E.A.R that we love pissing our pants to. The kinetic action with the much more intense fear you feel will add to anyone’s love for the game. While not adding much graphically, and offering some different areas you fight in; a church and subway. You’re still running through dark corridors of sewers and decrepit buildings in one of the ugliest cities ever seen. The game lacks length and extension of the plot. So, if you’re looking for plot, just wait for F.E.A.R 2. If you want more of the same kinetic heart racing action and hair standing fear then pick it up. With around three to five hours of game play and the ability to pickup the game for $20 then this isn’t a bad deal. Just feels like we are being fooled until the next chapter in the series hits store shelves.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Dead Rising is one of those games that is just so unique (for a video game at least) that no matter how crappy the game is you can still find some reason to play it. Luckily Capcom has not made one of those games. It has made a good game all around.  The game consists of many missions associated with rescuing survivors and killing psychopaths. All while trying to avoid an endless supply of zombies throughout the mall. Many of these missions are optional and in your first playthrough you will learn this very fast. The game has its own time limit for completing things, so completing every mission is real challenge. The majority of people will not do this for at least 3 playthroughs. Luckily you can save your stats all through the game. However, what makes all of this more difficult is that there is only one save slot. So if you screw up and accidentally save then it's all over. One of the most impressive parts about the game is the large amount of objects lying around the mall that you can use as weapons. Pretty much everything you can think of is sitting somewhere. Your character also has his own set of moves to combat his enemies. Many of which are just plain awesome (Level 50 skill is very interesting...). It's just too bad that the controls for these moves are so similar that it becomes difficult to pull off the correct stuff. Another annoying problem is that the people you rescue are pretty stupid. They run into things and get themselves into trouble all the time. That coupled with the unforgiving save system causes a lot of pain.  What really impressed me about Dead Rising were its visuals. Though the graphics are very nice that is not what I mean. It's the design of everything that is most impressive. It's hard to think that this is a Japanese game. Everything in the mall is just so North American. Every item and location has a very familiar look to it. It's amazing how few games out there are actually this detailed and take place in a modern everyday location. It would be nice to see more games like this.  Even more impressive is the soundtrack. While the music is a little out of place (yet still catchy) the sound effects are perfect. From the footsteps to a blender to the sound of a zombie getting his head ripped off. Everything is so clear and often brutal. It's always nice to see a game pay so much attention to sound design.  Overall Dead Rising is a great game for someone looking for something completely new. With the way the game systems are set up it makes for a game that is not too short and not too long. It has a few problems, but overall the more you play the more you can overcome them.  PROS + Gameplay made for multiple playthroughs + So many weapons! + Viscious sound effects + Great sense of humor + Zombies In A Mall!!!  CONS - One save slot? - Story sort of dies at the end - Stupid A.I - Controls for skills are complicated - It's pretty much the same thing over and over\",\n",

       "  'description': 'War is hell, that’s what I say. War is fun, that’s what some soldiers say. War brings peace…. The list goes on forever and probably will one day include War doesn’t involve guns. Meanwhile we can use Battlefield 2142 to see what World War 3 may hold for us. Do the guns shoot laser beams instead of different calibers of bullets? Well, the answer to that is no. It seems according to DICE, the company behind the battlefield series, doesn’t think so but, the future holds many unlockables and Titians. The game as usual has no campaign, and its single player aspect never did hold up when compared to multi player. There is a back-story to this version, well there needed to be. Otherwise, it would go something like this: \\t“Hey John, I wanna shoot a gun.” \\t“Ok John, here’s a gun” \\t“Bob, I wanna a war.” \\t“Okay, lets go piss off the PAC the same way our late president George W. Bush pissed off the whole Middle East.” Yeah that’s how I see it. Well, the back-story, epilogue, is that it is the dawn of a new ice age and two factions the EU and PAC are fighting over the land that is actually habitable. Therefore, two factions, the European Union and the Pan Asian Coalition, which means no egotistical Americans that, think they are better. When you first start, you obviously start at the lowliest of ranks and have to work your way up to get unlockables and eventually new weapons. Unlockables consist of grenades, steroids, emp grenades, tiny shields, shotgun blasts, odd looking deliberators, a C4 like demo pack, and much more. On your way through your ranks, there are six unlockables for each class; four classes in all. Then after you unlock three unlockables, up the same column, you can then unlock a gun! There are two unlockables guns for each class but you must unlock all six unlockables to get both guns. Currently I’m working my way up both Support and Assault; the other two classes are Recon and Engineer. So lets see, so far we’ve got, twenty-four unlockables, eight unlockables guns, and plus another eight unlockables, four of which are for you personally and another four for squad leaders. You and about another one million people are going to be very busy with this game. The game plays just as BF2 did, except the weapons are somewhat futuristic and more accurate, if you can call it that. I say that because the future doesn’t seem too different from the current. Conquest mode still stays pretty much the dominant game type while Titian mode brings some new core values to the game sometimes it gets boring because your team just isn’t that good. The new APCs are useful for Titian mode because on the shields are down you just park them near the enemy titian, right click, and your rocketing through air to maneuver your pod onto the deck that way you can infiltrate the enemies Titian and destroy the core. The whole game really is just like a BattleField 2 mod, or BF2’s Vietnam. So game play wise, not much has changed, and the vehicles feel more futuristic than the weapons and there is a new mode; Titian mode. Graphics, well, there is a new lighting engine which it either incorporates Bloom or HD, not sure which one it is. Besides the new lighting, it’s the same engine, except the future looks bleak compared to current day wars portrayed in BF2. The color palette doesn’t change much with each map and when it does, you won’t notice. The palpable feel of “OMG THIS is F***ING awesome” isn’t there as much as it was with BF2 and it will feel like a mod. I can say though, that the sound in the game is very stylish especially the score for the game. It’s futuristic yet seems to have undertones of Beethoven in the score, it actually makes loading bearable. Loading does seem shorter though, well, after you get past that initial first load of any map then it speeds right through, as long as you don’t change any settings. Battlefield 2142 brings some new game play with it along with a better customization of your soldiers. Something’s feel futuristic, other things not so much. The feeling that it’s a mod just never really gets beyond your brain and sometimes you feel bored of playing the old same game….wait it’s a different game. With some graphical glitches, and glitches that have plagued the series for a while now it sometimes destroys the intense fun your looking for in a war. Although, with a new lighting system, some really nice music, the introduction of Titian mode, this game still lands on what the series is all about; awesome online play. In-Game ads are in the game, not mentioned much, well, because they don’t bother me. If this is how World War 3 will be fought, though I would suggest you pick it up if your love the Battlefield series or are looking for a good online game. Actually, yeah, pick this one up because if this is how World War 3 will be fought then World War 4 will be fought with sticks and stones.',\n",

       " {'deck': 'Bad Writing, Fun Battle System = Great RPG?',\n",
       "  'description': 'The Legend of Dragoon was an RPG released for the Sony Playstation back in 2000, it featured some nice graphics, a cool story, one of the most enjoyable RPG battle engines in a long time, but the localization/translation of the game’s text is what impacts this game the most in the long run. The game starts as most Japanese RPG’s do, innocently, a young man named Dart has returned from a quest to avenge his parent’s deaths at the hands of the Black Monster to find his country in a time of war. His village is burnt down and his good friend Shana is brought to a terrible prison. Soon after rescuing her, the story begins to unfold until it is a matter of world safety. The depth of the story is definitely there, as there are some incredible thought that went into the return of the Dragoons, the history of the world and a couple of the games great plot twists. But because of the terrible translation/localization of the game’s text, it becomes more a matter of personal imagination than the game telling you outright in most cases.  If you remember Final Fantasy VII’s translation work and cringe at the thought of it, then this is probably even a step below that. Typos, grammatical errors, oddly placed words, horrible style and many other bad writing breakdowns. A great example is in about the middle of the game, there is a place you visit called the “Valley of Corrupted Gravity” and for a majority of the times it is written in the textboxes just like that. But in a few specific cases, for some reason, the writers spelled “vally” instead of “valley” it’s that kind of stuff that plagues the writing in the game. Giving credit where credit is due though, there are few times when the writing is actually quite superb and that makes those times when it falls flat all the more frustrating. It was as if they directly translated the text and had their good days and their bad days while touching it up.  As in most RPG’s you progress from town to town, location to location, following key story triggers. Dragoon simplifies things by keeping you to set paths of “dots” to each location on the over-world map. The game even goes as far as telling you what location you should go to next when you zoom all the way out with a blue spinning arrow. This feature (we’ll call it) is a double-edged sword, for one, it saves you from the frustration of getting lost on the world map, though on the other hand it pretty much denies you of any exploration off the beaten path. The actual locations and towns are a different story as they consist of amazing looking pre-rendered backgrounds and have many different paths to explore and usually a compliment of treasure boxes to find.  Random battles are what RPG’s are all about and The Legend of Dragoon handles these very well, except for maybe the 15 second wait before each fight. Once you are set and fighting, it takes place in a turn based system with your three characters pit against an assortment of monsters and other enemies. You have a few options when fighting, the first option is the standard “attack”, more about this in second because it worth talking about in detail. Second is a neat take on defending called “guard,” this choice halves all damage taken and restores 10% of your hit points, it adds a neat strategic element to the fights. Of course you have items and the ability to run away. Once you receive the ability to transform in to Dragoons about 3 hours or so into the game, you’ll have that option as well.  It’s now time to talk about the standard attack system, called addition, this system is timing based and once you get the hang of it; it is by far the game’s coolest feature. Once you choose attack, then your target, you’ll see a blue square over the enemy that you picked. A second blue square spirals from near the sides of the screen; you must time your press of the X button when the squares exactly intersect. It starts off pretty easy as most characters only have one button press moves, but later into the game you may have to do 6-7 presses to successfully complete an addition string. But to keep things interesting each character has multiple moves (you pick one from the main submenu) each with different timing and a different amount of button presses. You also have to contend with counter attacks from enemies during slow moves or slow parts of your attack strings, a counter attack, requires you to press the Circle button instead of X. Also each time you do one of your characters addition moves 20 times they raise in strength and how many SP you get. Do a move 80 times to master it, master all your moves and you unlock the characters most powerful addition attack.  The other interesting aspect of the battles are the Dragoon transformations, these require a special stone to be collected, but all but one of them you’ll pick up as you go through the main quest. Once you get this stone you’ll be able to transform during battle, but only for one turn, to get more turns as a Dragoon you must do addition attacks to get what is called SP or Spirit Points. Each hit in an addition string gains you a specific amount of points, the game transparently collects these points and when you gain enough you raise what is called a D. Level, each D. Level (up to 5) gives you 20 more MP, 1 more turn as a Dragoon and in every level except the 4th you gain special Dragoon magic. The characters in this game cannot use magic, so transforming into Dragoon form is their only access to it. Dragoons also gain powerful boosts to their attack and defense, protection from all status effects (except death,) not to mention transforming cures all ailments as long as you can still transform. Dragoons attack using a Dragoon version of addition, in this version you have to press X as a spinning light hits the top of a circular meter, doing it five times successfully nets you a full power Dragoon attack. Another feature of the Dragoons’ is if you have everyone available to transform, then you then have a special transformation that activates all three characters and the character that chose the option gets automatic perfect Dragoon additions. With that amount of strategy Dragoons are best used during the game’s boss fights, because you will want to gain SP and raise your additions during normal combat.  As for items the game has a few unique items called Multis these items are elemental magic and once you toss them, you can pump them up by mashing the X button. Speaking of elementals, Dragoon uses a simple element system for its fights, every element has an opposite (light/dark, fire/water, earth/wind,) except Lightning, twice the damage to the opposite, half damage to same and normal damage otherwise. Dragoon’s battles are what sets the game apart from most RPG’s and trying to master all the characters addition moves gives the game longevity.  Not that Dragoon is a short game in the first place; it will take you upwards of 40 hours to complete, maybe more the first time through the game. If there is one fault to the gameplay is that game is quite easy, there is no EXP grind, as you hardly get any EXP for normal fights, you only need to fight random battles to get SP and raise additions. If you are going to do any levelling it’s after a boss fight as you get massive chunks of EXP from them. And levelling hounds might be disappointed to find that there are only about 60 levels of EXP in the game. This probably needs mentioning as well, the way the game is balanced mostly to Magic Defense, you may find yourself shying away from the powerhouse characters for ones better against magic.  Graphically The Legend of Dragoon is a great looking game, there are a few rough spots but overall the game is very appealing. For example the pre-rendered backgrounds in the game look amazing, especially the ones that feature water, whomever the artist was that did the water sparkles and water animation was spot on. To keep the static backgrounds from being boring Dragoon puts all kinds of effects on them, smoke from chimneys, hazy clouds, birds and other animated objects make for a lifelike look. The battle engine graphics are really great as well; there are plenty of over the top effects for the Dragoon magic, tons of neat little bouncy sparks and light flashes during addition strings and an assortment of other neat looking effects. There are also a few times during the game where a characters polygon model is a “high-res” version; they even have separate fingers, which is pretty impressive for a PSone game. The game also features some outstanding FMV CG movies; a couple of them have to be seen to be believed. The only poor areas are that during sequences on the pre-rendered backgrounds, occasionally the polygons in the characters twitch and it’s a bit distracting and the characters have not so seamless joints.  The sound in Dragoon is quite sharp as well, there are some great slashing sounds, but most of the sound effects consist of your characters grunts during addition strings, these sounds are key as they actually help you with timing of your moves. Characters also call out their moves when you complete a string of presses successfully, it’s pretty cool especially after you nail a tough addition, but it may get a bit repetitive after a while. The music in Dragoon is also very good, it has a slight off-beat score, with off beat meaning instruments that don’t necessarily fit in with the swords and dragons motif of the game. You’ll hear electric guitars, steel drums and other interesting instruments complimenting the more traditional sounds in the music. The game also has a lovely theme song that you get to hear during the intro movie on Disc 1 and at the end of the game.  The Legend of Dragoon is a game that lives mostly by its battle system; the story is also a good point if you can ignore the quality of the writing. The characters are memorable and so is the overall adventure. This game could have been almost perfect if it wasn’t for the poor translation and pretty awful writing. But in the end it’s not a game, any RPG fan should miss. ',\n",

       "  'description': 'We all have seen the big black box that led us to experience seizures while killing the Covenant or the Flood. I’m sure most of us played it and enjoyed it or played it and said it was for noobs. We may have been arrogant enough to say, “Xbox sucks Gamecube is better” or “Xbox sucks PS2 is better.” Then the pc gamers will always say, “The pc is a superior game machine compared to all of them.” This is still true but the game Halo doesn’t lend itself to helping the pc’s superiority situation. Three years ago, Halo made the jump from Xbox to the PC. Naturally most of us wouldn’t buy it because we said, “it’s for noobs.” Three years from that launch, I finally picked up Halo for the pc and for $20 who can complain. I owned an Xbox for one year and had maybe five games for it that never really held my attention. Except Halo 2 held my ADHD at bay for at the most two days and whenever friends ever came over to play games. I sold my Xbox after a year to buy Call of Duty 2, and F.E.A.R for my pc and to have some extra spending money. Halo while it had mouth-watering visuals on the Xbox falls through on the PC because Gearbox failed to upgrade the graphics for the PC version. While not always aesthetically pleasing the game lends itself to just how far graphics have come in the years and for a game made in 2003 it still plays well. Which is what brings us to what Halo really is; a game with intense interactive game play and a engaging story that looks to bring you into a unique Sci-Fi world. Out dated graphics usually would lead someone to think that the in game sound is not up to PC standards. Well this is wrong as when the action gets intense in this one-man war the music score will rip through your speakers and command you to listen to it. Random pops and static will rip through headphones and speakers occasionally and especially when you see the “Loading…Done” in the top of the screen. With that transition, we are at the loading times for this game and it is almost none maybe five seconds at the most when loading the game from the menu screen. Loading times such as five seconds to load has been unheard of for a while with games like Battlefield 2 taking a minute or more to load. This is true for loading into multiplayer also. If you are not one who is good at console games because of the controllers used then you may find Halo multiplayer fun. On the other hand, if you are the opposite you will like it better on the Xbox. Then again, you could be like me and not like it on either one because you for some reason just can’t grasp Halo multiplayer. Even though I didn’t enjoy multiplayer over the internet I can guarantee that you will have fun if you have a LAN with some friends and smack talk a lot. Those are just my quick thoughts on this outdated game for the PC. Everyone knows the story no matter what console you play and while Gearbox didn’t do the best job bringing the game to the pc because some textures look horrible and like your grandma’s outdated 1950’s home this game is enjoyable if you have $20 to blow. The game really wasn’t optimized much so even on high end systems you will run into some performance problems. So if your waiting for christmas or just don’t have the money to buy Battlefield 2142 or a brand new game pick this up to keep you going till December 25h or 24th if you’re greedy and want to get yelled at by your wife, girlfriend, or parents. The game is enjoyable and fun and most pc gamers will like the story and very intense game play.',\n",

       "  'description': \"STORYFinal Fantasy X starts off in a futuristic metropolis where Tidus a star Blitzball player is signing autographs and preparing for a Blitzball game(Blitzball is a very popular sport on their world) and all of a sudden their city of Zanarkand is attacked by a giant creature named Sin that releases smaller creatures called Sin Spawn and they start attacking people. Tidus bumps into Auron,a friend of his father who Tidus has not seen in years(you learn Tidus's father disappeared when he went on a mission)and Tidus and Auron fight off the Sin spawn but Tidus is sucked up by Sin and wakes up 1000 years in the future. Tidus finds out in the future,the people believe Sin is their punishment for using technology and destroying nature,and everytime they kill Sin,Sin is reborn again.Sin always attacks villages that use machines(what they refer to as machina)or villages that destroy or deplete nature to a greater extent. You even see FMV footage of Sin destroying villages in seconds with tsunamis,tornadoes and powerful energy blasts. Tidus meets a bunch of characters who will later form a group,they are  Rikku-An Al Bhed(The Al Bhed are considered evil for using technology,but Rikku took Tidus on her boat and fed him when he first arrived 1000 years in the future,so Tidus knows she is not evil.Although Rikku was the first person Tidus meets 1000 years in the future,she doesn't join the group until half way through the game. Wakka-A conservative islander who is very loyal towards Yevon,the religion the people 1000 years in the future follow,which forbids the use of technology and destruction of nature.Wakka is also a blitzball team captain and introduced Tidus to the group because he was impressed with Tidus's Blitzball skills. LuLu-a snobby sorceress who is also very conservative and looks down at Tidus a lot. Yuna-A beautiful female summoner who is the person the grouo are protecting(they are her guardians)Yuna was named after lady Yunalesca,the first person to kill Sin,and her father Sir Braska also killed Sin too,and Yuna hopes to kill Sin and bring ''the Calm'' a period of time before Sin is reborn. Kimahri-A panther humanoid from a race called the Rhonso.He has been Yuna's guardian since she was a child,he is very protective of Yuna but barely says a word.His race see him as a deserter for leaving his tribe and other Rhonso always take cheap shots at Kimahri. Auron-Auron and Tidus's father(Sir Jecht)were the guardians of Sir Braska and are greatly respected by the people in the world of Spira.This doesn't make sense to Tidus at first because his father and Auron are from 1000 years in the past,but later on it is revealed how it is possible,and it's a huge twist you will never guess.Auron has a cool,calm personality,he seems confident and wise and his eyeshades help add to his mysteriousness too The story does a great job of introducing the characters at just the right time. Tidus himself is very friendly and bubbly,he holds a great deal of anger towards his father due to the emotional abuse his father gave him,and how he felt everything he did was never good enough for his father.Tidus though is very kind and has a goofy sense of humor. The people on Spira are always sad because Sin is destroying their world but Tidus is able to cheer Yuna up and make her laugh and understands her so they fall in love.But Tidus receives a shock at what Yuna must do to kill Sin,and he receives a huge shock when he finds out Sin's true identity. Other twists include the political corruption,what are Seymour's motives? is worshipping Yevon and the Fayth the right thing to do? blackmail comes into the story,and other twists I don't want to ruin for you,but will leave you with tears in your eyes. GRAPHICSThe full motion video is breath taking,the people and city of Luca look so real.When Sin destroy villages in seconds with tsunami's,giant tornadoes,and energy blasts big enough to penetrate all the way to the ocean floor and circle the planet,it looks shocking and spectacular at the same time. Real people being used for the full motion video brings it more to life,and the cinematography is beautiful,with beautiful water effects,and I love the full motion video scene when Seymour shows the characters Zanarkand 1000 years in the past with the city all lite up at night with people walking around and beautiful views of the galaxy. On cut scenes the characters show realistic facial expressions and you even see tears in their eyes.The characters have unique fashion but it also matches who are they eg Tidus and his father Jecht wear the same fashion,Auron wears the same uniform as Braska,Kimahri dresses like a warrior,Lulu's black outfit makes her look like a witch,Rikku has her high tech gadgets etc. The environments vary from the futuristic metropolis of Zanarkand,to the beautiful tropical island of Besaid, with white sand,crystal blue water,plam trees,waterfall and island village.Over the ocean,other tropical islands,temples,city of Luca,country side,forest,Seymour's mansion with the vegetation growing inside is just plain creepy,spirit plains,lightning plains,Macalania with the beautiful stars,snowy mountains,desert and canyons,grassy plains,caves,airship,Zanarkand ruins 1000 years in the future and even inside Sin and Sin's mind! GAMEPLAYWell gameplay is usually the most important thing,but Final Fantasy X is story based,so the story makes up most of the gameplay experience. However you will have a lot of fun exploring the locations,it's so adventurous how one minute your in the futuristic city of Zanarkand,and the next your on a beautiful tropical island.There is also hidden locations and side quests to be found too.Basically it's your typical turn based Japanese RPG,go from village to village,random monster battles,levelling up on the way,and revealing the story.Like in Japanese RPG's you need to spend a lot of time levelling up,but the sphere grid allows your characters to become powerful much quicker than in other Japanese RPG's so you won't need to grind your way through the game.However you have a lot of levelling up to do before you'll be any match for some of the bosses. All the characters are needed at some point,eg Auron,Tidus,Wakka and Kimahri for strength,Auron for armor break,Tidus for Hastega,Wakka to take out flying enemies.LuLu for elemental enemies,Yuna for her Aeon overdrives and healing,and Rikku for her ability to pull the legs of robots and her Al Bhed potions. Characters are fully healed at save points,and healing magic can be used outside of battle,saving you a lot of money and time. SOUNDThe characters speak with amazing expression in their voice,you can tell if they are happy,sad,angry,emotional etc.When Tidus and Yuna are in the lake under the stars and Yuna is crying and Tidus holds her and kisses her,you hear the beautiful Asian love song Suteki Da Ne play and it brings a tear to your eye. When Tidus is about to fight his father the music changes to a sad tune,and hearing the emotion in his voice and his father's voice will also bring a tear to your eyes. The characters voices suit their personalities perfectly. The music suits the locations,from the peaceful music in the tropical island of Besaid,to the gentle music in the country and forest. You hear chanting for Yevon at the temples,at Blitzball games you hear heavy rock music and crowds roaring.When your high up on the mountains,you hear the wind blowing.The music can motivate you,or make you feel empathy for the characters.Auron's cool,calm voice acting can even motivate you too when you feel the group is beginning to bond. TIdus narrates parts of the story letting you know what he was thinking at the time,it has a nice effect. OVERALL-My favorite game ever and in my opinion the best story for a video game ever,and when you see the ending,you will cry and it's a game you can never forget. \",\n",

       "  'description': 'Mario Kart Wii is a game of its predecessors. It is a safe and plausible new addition to the Mario Kart universe. The game feels familiar from the beginning, Grand Prix, Time Trial, VS and Battle modes are all there. There are changes, a wheel that comes with the game, dual players of Double Dash are gone motorcycles are in. The control scheme now has four choices, wii wheel, nunchuk and wii remote, GameCube controller and the classic controller.At the beginning, you’re asked to create a license by selecting your mii of choice. You are then presented with a selection screen. Single Player allows you to play the Grand Prix races, 50cc, 100cc, 150cc. Playing these allows you to unlock many things within the game, including your very own mii. There are thirty two tracks, from a wide range of Mario Kart incarnations, four for every Cup Race. Multiplayer is your local matches with up to two to four people, with four modes of choice. Nintendo WFC is your portal to the online Mario Kart Wii universe, using your wi-fi connection. You can choose one or two players, two players being split screen, after you choose you can play VS or Battle. VS mode allows online racing action with up to twelve people. You can choose worldwide, regional or friends. Battle mode is the same, except its team based for the games of Balloon Battle and Coin Runners. The Mario Kart Channel can be accessed either in the game menu or through the Wii Menu; you will be prompted if you wish to do this. Through the Mario Kart Channel you can access your friends, register friends, race ghosts, download ghosts, check your rankings, and race in tournaments.The game has a lot to offer the Wii owner just entering the Mario Kart universe and past players from the Super Nintendo days, online being my favorite and most addictive, having not played the Mario Kart DS version, I can’t compare the two. The gameplay has been refined as to become more accessible to many people. I find the wii remote and nunchuk most comfortable, but I have been beat many times online with someone using the wii wheel. I was never a fan of the battle modes; I’ve played a few times on single player to practice and online, but I always return to VS mode in online play. The “one more game” theme plays a prominent role for me. You’re given a VR rating of 5000 at the beginning of your online play, VS or Battle, this will go up or down according to how you play. When you do go online the VR rating somewhat determines whom you play with. I’m usually around 7000 plus, when my VR ranking goes down I find much easier competition, when my VR ranking goes up the competition becomes very stiff. Then there are the zen moments, either you can’t be beat or you respect your opponents to the point that by the fifth race you feel he or she is your friend. Those are the friend codes you would like to have but probably will never have, the only fault in a great experience, as you try to recapture it by playing just one more game.With graphics that run smooth as silk, addition of new tracks, being online and so many options of play, you can’t go wrong with this one. Could there have been more tracks? Sure. How about voice chat? I don’t know. How about the power- ups? They could have toned them down but, with practice you learn to deal with them. Did they mess with Battle Mode to much? According to my nephew, too much change was a bad thing. The real question is did they improve Mario Kart? Yes. Did they reinvent the wheel? No.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Phantom Hourglass....ah where to begin... the good: great controls good story/characters quirky dialogue great boss fights good collectibles OUTSTANDING puzzles  the bad: easy dungeon that you have to go back to again and again and again small variety of weapons  Phantom Hourglass is like a rare stone.  You don\\'t find them often, but when you do, you are really happy about it.    GAMEPLAY: 9/10 The game plays fairly like the other Zelda games, but most like the wind waker. You find yourself again as Link traveling the seas with Tetra in search of the mysterious Ghost Ship. When they find it, Tetra jumps aboard and becomes prisoner of the ship. Link is then knocked off the boat and washed up on an island. There he meets Ciela, a fairy that has lost her memory, and you set off to save Tetra. The gameplay is the same, you travel around and sail around to islands and various temples to unlock powers to help you in your ultimate quest. It is a bit on the easy side though. One mechanic I did not like was the Phantom Hourglass itself and the Temple of the Ocean King. The temple drained the life out of you and you could only stay alive if you had the phantom hourglass, which drained your life if it ran out of sand at the top. To make matters worse, there are knights called \"phantoms\" that are in the temple that cannot be killed until the very end of the game. If they touch you you die and you lose 30 sec. on your hourglass. To make it EVEN worse, you have to go back multiple times and go through floors you have already gone through. This brings the game down. I wonder who thought of the idea of a life-sucking temple you have to back to over and over again!! Also for you collectible people, PH has a boat collectible thing where you can collect different parts for sets of a boat. It is really fun and keeps you wanting to get new parts  CONTROLS 10/10 All of the controls are mapped to the touch screen, which easily could have turned into a disaster, but they pulled it off very well. You touch in the direction to walk (and run) and make lines along your enemy to slash, With a few button controls for pulling up maps. For the boomerang, you draw the path it will take and it will go unless disturbed. For the bow, you point in the direction you want to shoot. It is a great use of the touch screen and works out very well.  GRAPHICS 9/10 The graphics are great coming from the DS. It is top notch except for certain areas where the screen looks extra pixelated and less sharp. But there are few of those times so all is well.  ATMOSPHERE 9/10 The atmosphere and characters are great. There is a good amount of characters to talk to in the game and much of that text is funny and quirky, adding to the enjoyablility level. The expressions are also great, in one scene, Linebeck (your captain) shakes link silly and then gives him something, so the classic lifting of the item in your palm occurs but his eyes are swirling and he\\'s hobbling about. In another, when you get a negative rupee, the music tones down and his face turns to a sad suprised look. It really adds to the game.  PUZZLES 9/10 THE PUZZLES ARE AMAZING!!!!! They make total use of all of your items and controls. In one, you make a rope going through two pipes and then walk into it and use it as a boomerang. In another, you throw a bomb in between two rows of bomb plants and they detonate the plants hitting two switches at the same time. They are very creative and don\\'t lack at all.  Overall this game is Great.  A must buy for DS owners and even more for DS owning Zelda fans.',\n",

       "  'description': 'This game is pretty cool. You select from over 15 characters and fight throught arcade most, survival mode, or the singleplayer mode. The singleplayer mode is pretty cool. There is an adventurous story, in which you journey around the kingdom and meet new friends and enemies. You can buy new weapons with gold you get, and you level up. It has light RPG elements. The story is alright, and a nice surprise for a fighting game. The gameplay has all the kinds of movies you want and expect from a fighting game: vertical/horizontal attack, power up, block, grab, special attack, and other actions based on your stance. Overall, the gameplay is solid, and very fun in two-player mode. The graphics are okay. Nothing great, but they get the job done. The music sets the mood, but the announcer sometimes brings you out of the immersion when you fight enemies in the simgle-player story mode.

       "  'description': 'Is this the worthy successor to Super Mario 64? Yes. This game is amazing. It almost definitely places itself in the category of \"greatest games ever\" There is nothing mediocre about it whatsoever.  It starts out with Mario going to see Peach during the centennial passing of a comet. While going to the castle, Bowser comes with a fleet of Pirate ships and literally rips the castle out of the ground and pulls it into space. Mario gets knocked off the castle and falls into the orbit of a small \"planet\" as they call them (though they are more like odd fixtures of items floating around in space) and so begins his mission.  GRAPHICS: The graphics are incredibly good. Seeing as its all art design, you can definitely tell that they put A LOT of time into this. The water on the LoopdeLoop galaxy or Beach Bowl Galaxy reflect the light of the sun and moves like it actually has a tide and wind. It looks really good score: 10/10  GAME PLAY: just like Super Mario 64, Amazing. It is incredibly intuitive with the gravity affect. Some levels with a strong gravity if you jump of the edge of something then the gravity will suck you around the edge and up to the top. This also comes with some problems though. Its occasionally confusing when your upside down because what you think is going forward will send you backwards, but it seldom happens. The controls make the game play even more enjoyable. The easy and intuitive controls make the game even more enjoyable and add to the fun. score: 10/10  MUSIC: the music is a joy to listen to. On the comet (where you choose your missions) I often find myself humming along to the music and even singing what I think would be good lyrics to the song. With each level having its own specific music, it rarely gets old. music: 10/10  LEVEL DESIGN:  The levels are completely brand new and have never been thought out in any other game to date. Levels such as the freezyflame and toytime galaxies are incredibly original that range from freezing cold water to mama and climbing giant Bowser toy robots. They are incredibly fun but some levels seem like the producers got a bit lazy. The Gold Leaf galaxy is the Honeyhive galaxy mirrored and the ground is gold. A bit unoriginal if you ask me. Level design: 9/10  REPLAY VALUE: The replay value is very important in this game. It only takes 60 stars to beat the story part of the game, but there are still 60 more to be collected and apparently (I haven\\'t gotten all stars left) you can play through again as Luigi. The comets are also a good way to get you to go back to the level. Among them are the daredevil comet, where you fight a boss with only one health, the Speedy comets, where you beat a certain level within a time limit, and Purple Comets, which have you collect 100 purple coins within the level. You can also unlock a story that explains how Roselina came to live on the comet, but if you don\\'t want to read that you can skip it completely. replay value: 10/10  CAMERA: The self-moving camera is a nice burden taken of your shoulders and rarely gets in the way. There are a few bad areas, such as in the Honeyhive galaxy when you climb a ledge, you can only see Mario\\'s silhouette behind a giant tree, times like that are so scarce, it hardly matters. camera 10/10  Just looking at the scores for each individual topic, you can obviously tell that this game is incredible. As a worthy successor to Mario 64, any Wii owner should get this game no matter what.',\n",

       "  'description': ' Around 15 to 17 hours. That is how long it will take you to beat the 15 level campaign of Company of Heroes (CoH). Either that or I make a really bad general. If you do not know what CoH is let me inform you as to what it is. It is a World War 2 Real Time Strategy Game. The makers of Dawn of War bring you Company of Heroes. The land of the brave, where soldiers die for you and French wine is abundant. Getting drunk on wine though is not the subject of this game. We have all been there before, pushing the Nazi war machine back into Germany and ultimately watching Hitler piss his pants. Or did he kill himself? Either way we know the outcome. If you have a decent computer that runs, oh lets say, Half-Life 2 Episode One on high settings you are going to get a gorgeous game. The “Essence Engine” which is Relic’s new RTS engine shows what its made of with destructive environments, hill sides, multi-level maps, and fireworks galore. When you send your first artillery shower onto a group of panzers you will be delighted to see dirt fly up in the air and massive explosions as the panzers blow up along with the people inside. While most WW2 games tend to make the world look bleak a lot of times the French and German countryside come out as a nice serene place where The Sound of Music may have occurred. It only becomes bleak when you decimate it while liberating the French from Nazi Control. I have not talked on much of game play and usually I would do that in the first or second paragraph. Ultimately controls are the same as Dawn of War except some exceptions. You have three resources; munitions, manpower, and fuel. All of which you will need to conduct a coordinated attack on the enemy. You obviously capture certain control points to acquire these resources and use them to deploy troops, tanks, throw grenades, and call in air strikes….and so on. Then there also strategic control points that one would think most of them would be useful but most of the time they really aren’t. As I played through the game I just found it necessary to control most of the map and completely obliterate Hitler’s toys. The campaign also very subtly sneaks in one of the multiplayer modes that way you will know what to do when you actually play the mode. The mode is one where you just control strategic points. Now it only does this for one map but, it is a good way of introducing you to it. I won’t elaborate anymore because if you played Dawn of War or any other RTS you should be able to pick this game up with ease. The sounds of the game are not only phenomenal but, immersive. Go ahead and turn up the volume of your speakers to experience the “sound” of shell shock during an artillery blast or hear the very pissed off infantry or arrogant mechanics. There are obviously guns in this game now it’s not always clear what is being used but, the sounds are nice and just add more to the fact that you wish you had been in WW2. Think of it this way, back then you had to go to war to be a “man.” Now we just hate you if you go to war in Iraq. The musical score for this game will lift your hearts and sometimes make you think you are watching Saving Private Ryan which this game, no doubt, takes inspiration from. That is noticed in the very cinematic beginning of this game. Watch your army take a beating on the beaches of Normandy while you try to rescue 25 of 100 people. Load times aren’t really that bad but feel long because it doesn’t play music during them. Not really a con just the load times aren’t as long as some people may think they are. The story of Company of Heroes is told through a very cool artistic style combined with game cinematics that feel very unique and professional. This game will take you through hell and back again, through night and day, in the end your small and big combat dreams will be fulfilled by this game. I of course will recommend this game to any one who wants a non formulaic WW2 game with its own unique spins. This game gets 9.8 out of 10 mainly because it crashed on my computer twice but, that’s what I get for putting everything on high when I should have it on medium-high graphics.',\n",

       "  'description': \"This game is fun, but its a difficult one to recommend to most people. Its a  very back and forth type of game. As in, some parts are really cool, some parts  are totally lame. Fighting with your laser sword is really fun and NEVER gets  old, even though it is pretty repetitive and gets a little close to being  button-mashey. There is swearing and blood galore, the visuals are very  stylized, and the story, while a bit sparse and not too deep, is mature  and surprisingly interesting. Its quite possibly the most mature themed game on  the Wii, which is great! All the little sound effects and the look of the  menu screens are awesome because they remind you of the little beeps and bloops from the  video games of the 80s. Also, everything has really cool names. Your  character's name is Travis Touchdown, the city is Santa Destroy, there's a place  called Pizza Butt, and it just goes on from there.On the down side,  riding around the city on your funky motorcycle is extremely clunky and the  little map is almost completely useless. The blockiness works fine for the menus  but should not have been used for the map as well. These sequences are so bad  that they're just no fun at all and you'll find yourself wanting to get from one  place to another as quickly as possible just to get to another fighting  sequence. Also, the stupid little jobs you have to take to make money in between  the assassination and combat missions (coconut collecting, lawn mowing, etc)  play almost as bad as the bike riding and are really boring.No More  Heroes is definitely a game that you should rent before you buy. To play this  game is to repeatedly go back and forth between being really into in and being  really not into it. If you are able to put up with the awful parts, you will  have some wickedly mature fun with the sword fighting and watching the  storyline.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"When I picked up this game I was like YA, SWEET, and it was everything I wanted from the beginning. The game starts off 6 months after Prime 2's events with Samus the Bounty Hunter sleeping in her gunship. She is called onboard the GFS Olympus to recieve a message and things start getting to business quickly. Space Pirates attack the fleet and launch an attack on nearby Norion. Samus then fights off the flagship and down to the planet, where the plot really starts to thicken. Lets start with the controls. After the chunky controls of Metroid Prime 1 and 2 the point to aim accuracy just can't be beat. Sometimes I found the controls a little hard to get to, such as the visor button and the map button, but still worked. One of the things I liked was the stacked weaponry. Instead of having the nova beam, plasma beam, and regular beam at the same time, each one replaced the other. Same with missiles, instead of ice and reg. missiles, you have just ice missiles, which cause more damage and can freeze people. For something the series hasn't done in a game as far as I know, They sure covered flying from planet to planet very well. Even if you couldn't skip it, it was very well done. Another new thing was the objectives. You accomplished objectives and if you died you would respawn at the last objective you finished, still very helpful, but not if it was late. The respawn points go away after you turn off your Wii. The environments were very detailed and fun to explore. It really had that metroid feeling where you had to keep coming back once your weapons upgraded. Something Metroid Prime Hunters lacked. I also liked the monsters. They were very well created and had some cool ways to destroy them. The bosses, in my opinion, are some of the most original and best experiences I have ever seen. Some are hard until you realize the weak point and then its quite easy. I found most of the bosses quite linear but still a fun puzzle/challenge. Another odd thing to the game are collectibles. If you scan an enemy/creature you will get a red token, yellow for beating bosses, blue for something, and green for something. And in the extras menu you can trade these in for things as image galleries and soundtracks. And also for the first time.....drum roll....... ONLINE!!! well.......sort of. You can trade accomplishments with other Wii friends that have MP3. Not much, but still something. Overall this is, in my opinion, the best of the series and anyone who has a wii or is a fan of the series should get this game.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'First let me start off by saying that this review will not completely bash this game in anyway or will I completely undermine the fact that it had short comings. In all honesty this review at times will sound like Game spot’s review except I actually liked the game. Now let’s get to talking about this seven hour trip.  Prey is one of the few games next to Half-Life 2 that I think has a very well thought out story. Basically you’re Tommy and you don’t really like the fact that you are Cherokee and you want your girlfriend, Jen, to leave the reservation with you. This is what you, Tommy, would like to do. After beating two sexual harassment offenders in Jen’s bar and one too many you are abducted by aliens. That’s all you’re getting out of me for the story. Honestly I thought this had a very intriguing story line with some cool twist and turns and very odd points in it. At times though you will feel there isn’t a story but if you pay attention to the voices in your head you can figure out what’s going on.  Another high point in this game is the overall sound and musical score features 3 hours of listening. I won’t buy the soundtrack but it engrossed you into the game a whole lot more than some other games I have played. While the ambient sound is also good in its own aspects and the guns all sound like they would completely annihilate something from existence which they do. Not only do the guns sound cool but they are also some of the most unique weapons I have seen. Having three-legged insects legs be used as grenades and then another weapon that I swear looks like it is shooting some type of alien fetus at you will make you wonder what exactly was going through the developers minds. The musical score is what is going to keep you going through this game. Although ,at times you may or may not want to turn down the volume it depends if you like having a very creepy female/alien/was human laughing in your right ear and causing it to bleed.  Game play in a game is always an important factor to have. Well at first I wasn’t sure if I would like the portals. Now that that I have beaten the game I can say that not only is this game unique in the use of portals and gravity it’s also very intense. The one flaw in this really is while being invincible is cool it doesn’t add much to the game, after a while it gets kind of repetitive. When I say invincible I mean you die and go to the spirit world where you battle spirits to regain spirit health and normal health. It was interesting the first few times. Now then I’m going to be as bold as to say I had more fun with this game than Doom 3 or Quake 4 for the very reason it is intense, quick, fast paced, and fun. Plus the awesome weapons you really couldn’t do much wrong. Puzzles in the game actually require some thought at times and sometimes they are fairly easy. Since puzzles could involve portals, gravity, or blowing something up it really is unique in that fact also. Basically the developers new what they were doing when they brought portals like this into gaming. I may also need to mention you do get use some sort of alien space craft during the game which it is fun and breaks up the run and gunning of the game. Now I don’t seem to be focusing on graphics much. While they are important to me it is the Doom 3 Engine. We should all know it can render beautiful and disgusting (in a good way) environments. This engine worked well with PREY to render some of its fantastic worlds. While some people may say it is more of a Mod. Honestly it isn’t. People said that about Sin Episodes Emergence but you need to look more closely at it to see it does have its own art style of sense of its own in the engine. While there is one enemy that looks very identical to one from the Doom universe most of the Aliens and creatures seem to be more inspired from movies such as Alien or the latest installment Alien vs. Predator. The only thing I think the developers did wrong was one, it is short it actually only took me seven hours to beat, and you can’t die which gets rid of a feeling of anxiousness and worry when your close to death. So I give them thumbs up for doing something new and making it work very well. It probably would have been better if it was longer. If you want something to keep you busy through the summer drag I would definitely suggest this game. It is also worth replaying through one more time maybe two more times. This game gets 9.0 out of 10 for me.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Developer BioWare, famous for such games as Neverwinter Nights and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, it looks to continue to that pedigree with their latest title Mass Effect. The most important part of an RPG is its storyline and Mass Effect delivers, with a Sci-Fi Space Opera of universe shattering proportions. You play as Commander Shepard, this man or woman, can look anyway that you desire with the fairly in depth character designer. After a short first mission you become the first Human Spectre Agent and begin to chase after a rogue spectre named Saren. He appears to be controlling a race of machines called Geth and is searching for an ancient technology that threatens every living thing in the Milky Way. But what really sets Mass Effect apart in the story category is the way you interact with the story and characters. The dialog wheel gives you the opportunity to choose how to behave and what to do during the dialog scenes. Some may argue that the dialog wheel is overly simplified, because top right is always Paragon (good cop) and the bottom right is always Renegade (bad cop), but each selection can change how characters react to you or affect the entire situation.  As a Paragon for example, you might talk out the situation, ending a potentially violent situation in a peaceful way, whereas the Renegade might just decide to shoot first and ask questions later or end violence with more violence. Another way the story is affected is by the choices you make about your origins, you can pick what kind of life you had as youth and what the defining moment is that set you apart in your military career. Based on what you pick characters will react to you differently either admiring you for your efforts or get put off by your upbringings. By the end of the story in classic BioWare fashion you will have to make a huge decision that might leave you conflicted. The story is a great one that you will want to explore for yourself, but the depth of the characters and the amount of back-story and detail about the universe and how it works went above and beyond generous.  Continuing on, with more on character customization, you can select from 6 pre-set classes. The first class is a straight up soldier, who is good at all types of guns (the four being pistol, shotgun, sniper rifle and assault rifle). The adept who is excellent at using biotics, which are powers that use dark energy to lift, throw and trap enemies in energy fields. The final main class is the Engineer who is great at using technology to his advantage, by overloading energy shields, sabotaging weapons or even hacking the enemy robots\\' AI using it against its own side. The other three classes are mixtures of the first three: Infiltrator, which is a mixture of soldier and engineer; Vanguard, which is a mixture of adept and soldier and finally Sentinel, which is a mixture of adept and engineer. These classes are all well balanced, but require different strategies and support characters to be effective. Also later in the game you gain access to a specialized class, which allows you specialize in one aspect of your chosen class.  As for the gameplay of Mass Effect you will take part in missions all over the galaxy on many different planets and fighting your enemies in simple, slightly tactical 3rd person shooting. There are two sets of progressions in Mass Effect the main story missions and the side missions. The main story missions will last you about 15-20 hours as you make your way closer to stopping Saren. These missions are generally longer and more detailed as you fight through all kinds of labs and bases and even take part in some boss fights. The side missions however, are not nearly as interesting as the main ones. They tend to be short, repetitive simple missions where your toughest objective might be to just kill all the enemies infesting the base. But doing a mixture of main and side missions helps balance out the repetitive simplicity of the side missions. Though there are over 20 hours of side missions to take part in, all of which lead to good gear, interesting side stories and lots of rewards.  As you play all these missions your will be introduced to the game\\'s battle system a real-time 3rd person tactical shooting engine. The first thing that you will learn is that if you try to play it as a pure 3rd person shooter you are going to get destroyed. At first, with low levels you need to really manage your squad, consisting of yourself (Shepard) and two others of your choosing, by using the power selecting wheel that you access via the RB bumper. Activating this menu stops the action allowing you to use one special power at a time on your squad or the enemies. Using tech or biotic powers to help control the numerous enemies you will face at a time. Good strategy, such as using choke points works well to help keep you alive. The shooting is solid and exciting, so once you get the feel for the combat it all comes together, though the game doesn\\'t really explain the best ways to fight, you just have to learn, trail by fire.  The AI of the enemies is different for each type of being you will face, the Geth like to use cover, while the humans (and a few of the other aliens) like to charge recklessly. Some of the bigger enemies are also aggressive, but this makes it much easier to run in to a room as Shepard and lure them to the rest of your squad and your choke point for easy kills. Your squad\\'s AI is good in some situations, but there are occasions where it can unfortunately see an enemy through a wall and will just keep shooting the wall even though it can\\'t hit the enemy. Though if you tell them to move towards a door they will take cover on both sides of the door and cover you when you open it, which is a nice touch. Your squad as long as you keep an eye on them they behave pretty well and give you pretty good support.  To help protect your characters you will need weapons and armor, each character is equipped with the four guns in the game, but only the soldier can train in them all. Without training your character will not be able to use the gun well, though each class can at least train with pistols. The same goes for armor, each class is only capable of a certain level of armor, all classes can use light, some can train up to medium and only the soldier can train to use the heavy armor. Both weapons and armor can be augmented with different types of add-ons, these upgrade mods can give you increased shields, more stopping power, different types of ammo and many other types for all situations. The only problem with all this gear is that there is no good way to tell how much you have, you are only allowed to carry 150 items (guns (all 4 types), armor, upgrades (all types), biotic amps and omnitools). The biggest problem is that none of the items stack, so if you have three of the same upgrade they all remain separate and clog up your list. The inventory system could have been a bit more streamlined, but at least the game warns you when you are close to the 150 item limit.  If you choose to do some side missions, you will encounter another side to the game, one that might be as sharp as the rest of it. Most of the side missions take place on \"uncharted\" planets that are nothing more than barren wastelands with maybe a single base or camp. They have no trees, no rivers and no water, nothing just rocky terrain with a different colored texture. The other thing that makes exploring planets not as fun as it could be is the Mako, your moon buggy crossed with a tank. The Mako just does not control well, it handles jerkily and will sometimes change direction without warning. But probably it\\'s biggest flaw is the tank\\'s turret, because it can only aim up or down a certain amount, it means that if you move your crosshair passed the end point of the gun you do not get true aim; this is especially a problem on uneven terrain, you just will not be able to hit your targets with accuracy. Then final problem of the Mako is that while it has pretty massive energy shields, they take nearly 5 minutes to fully recharge, causing a lot of wait times before you can fight some more if you get in trouble.  Mass Effect graphics are spectacular… when they run properly. The game looks great; the characters are great looking and have great facial animation which allows them to express themselves like never before. The problem is that the game suffers from frame-rate dips fairly frequently and suffers from texture pop-in after load screens and when the game switches cut-scenes nearly all the time. These things are merely distractions though as you enjoy the great art style and even though the planets often lack details, they do have some beautiful views and skylines. The final thing is the sound and Mass Effect excels here too, with an amazing sci-fi score with an old school sort of early \\'80 sci-fi flair with lots of synth type instruments, it\\'s a joy to listen to. Then there is the voice acting in the game. Every single line is read with perfect inflection, prefect pacing… even the smallest of parts. The voice acting helps draw you in and become attached to the characters, you feel for them, you understand them and you want to see them all survive. Heck, BioWare even went to the trouble of having a narrator, narrate the main entries in the galactic codex, which is just amazing.  BioWare has done it again. If you are fan of RPGs this is a must play, but even if you just enjoy science fiction the amount of background details and the story can draw you in. With great graphics, great story, great well voiced characters and so much interaction with the universe and its characters belonging to you, you really have to experience Mass Effect for yourself.',\n",

       "  'description': \"I love gore in my games as much as the next guy. Glistening scarlet blood, is their really anything better in our beloved interactive medium? No More Heroes has gore, and it's fantastic. Gore is definitely not its problem, however (it wasn't Killer 7's either). Suda 51's new gen offering has the same old flaws that Grasshopper studios is known for: all flash and no substance. What's even worse is that even the flash will grind on your nerves, with\\xa0 extensively grating dialog, intentional or otherwise, and a completely pointless premise.The first disappointment that you will run into with this game are the controls, which can be wholly replicated, probably even be superior, on traditional next gen consoles. You do control some things with the motion controls, like whether your swing is to be high or low, and initiating execution animations. However, the game boils down to auto-targeting and shielding with the Z button and bashing the A button like its no tomorrow to swing your light saber. The amount of actual depth and move sets is depressingly limited, and considering the Wiimote implementation is unnecessary at best and unresponsive at worst, the whole game just seems like a missed opportunity. You can throw and stun enemies with the B button, but considering mashing the A button is so much easier, you will likely completely ignore this feature.On top of that, you'll be combating the camera more than you will the enemies. You will constantly get into awkward positions and get attacked by enemies you don't even see. The extent of the camera controls is pretty much delegated to the C button, which centers the camera, but it doesn't even work most of the time. Level design is drab, as you're essentially just going to fight wave after wave of identical enemies that can be defeated by mashing A and swinging your Wiimote in the arrow's direction that'll be on the screen to initiate an execution animation, until you get to the boss battles, which are just a slight variation on the typical enemies in that you'll need to dodge once or twice before you mash A like a maniac. The cherry on top of this feces cake is the completely useless overworld and inferior graphics, with no established solid framerate.Combine this with Travis, one of the most grating protagonist (antagonist perhaps?) found on Wii, and you have one of the worst high profile exclusives found on Nintendo's little white box. But I'm sure it'll be venerated and overrated by Suda 51's rabid fanbase, just as Killer 7 was. Too bad I don't buy it.-Dave\",\n",

       "  'description': 'his game begins with an interesting cinematic that provides a lot and very little insight to the story at the same time. I won’t say what the cinematic had except for the fact it was very intriguing. I would like to say I don’t think people understand the concept of episodic content. It is supposed to be short and cheap, which I will admit $20 is a bit extensive but if you were smart you would have bought it before June 1st you would of save $2. Will now with my insult out of the way I will now start with me review.  You have to get back into the citadel in the beginning of the game. If you don’t the core will go into a chain reaction and destroy you, Alyx, and a whole bunch of citizens so, with that understood you have to “retard” the cores chain reaction. So you go back into the citadel with a roller coaster ride (literally). Then from there you find your way to the core, the gravity gun becomes supercharged for only 1 chapter. After you have successfully “retarded” the core you must get out of City 17. Along the way you will meet the Zombine, which is a zombie only with a combine body. Being with Alyx for this whole episode adds for a different game play style which is a big welcome.   I will not go much into what you will see along the way except my favorite part of the game is where you are in this huge room and it is pitch black. The elevator has loss power and you have to find the power box. So you must illuminate the way for Alyx and you and find the box, once you do the elevator gets power. At the same time you have awoken every single Zombie and Zombine and they are going to kill you. You have to illuminate the enemies for Alyx to shoot; it will get your heart pumping. Something to note is that the Zombine have this suicide idea where they charge at you with a grenade, very entertaining.   The graphics in this are improved on a little but the biggest introduction is HDR, which people would be surprised by just how much better a game looks with HDR. So I will say yes the world is beautiful and the series still has some of the best graphics for a first person shooter. Valve has also added a more dynamic voice acting and facial expression system. Adding that to Alyx makes for a very moody girl, which I’m sure most people welcomed when it looked like she was about to cry in the game. Also they added some nice techno music to go with some of your firefights.   Overall this game is fast paced with a lot of overwhelming action. Complete that with a Zombine and some unique puzzles it makes for a very nice game. Then add the new facial expression system along with HDR and other ambient sounds it pushes the source engine and Half-Life 2 into better graphics. This game to me is good for the $17 I paid for and I would have even been happy to pay $20 for. I will be going back and playing this game again. ',\n",

       "  'description': 'This is my first review so sorry\\xa0if it sucks. Anyway, I like so many others enjoyed and played the hell out of Ninja Gaiden Black and was super stoked when the sequel was announced. I rushed out and bought it as soon as I could. Personally I really enjoyed the game; however this doesn’t mean that it lived up to all my expectations.  To start off the combat is awesome. The weapons for the most part are fun to use. The combat is still fast paste like the original but now it is super gory, with severed limbs flying everywhere. However to me one of the games main weakness is in its combat. Mainly due to how frustrating it gets. Unlike the original it seems that the enemies in this have numerous moves that are absolute cheap shots that don’t give you a chance to attack back. For instance, there is one part in the game where you come to a shallow pool of water and several (10 or so) worms pop out of the ground. These worms have an attack in which they bite you and throw you around. My experience on this part consisted of me being attacked in this way and then being attacked with the same move again by a different worm right as I got up with virtually no time to dodge out of the way or pull off an attack of my own. These “cheap shots” seem to be true for many of the enemies in the game, including the bosses. Aside from this the combat is spot on and very satisfying.  Since it is easy to point out negatives in a game I will point out the games other huge problem, the camera. The camera in this game in many areas flat out sucks, and in some cases is just plain god awful. Sometimes you can’t even see what you are being attack by because you are surrounded by small melee enemies with flying ones launching stuff at you from off camera. Personally I think that the camera should be pulled out a bit.  Aside from these two big weaknesses the game has many strengths. The graphics, for the most part are excellent, however there is some minor slowdown every once in a while. The sound is also good, at least when I paid attention to it.   Overall this is an excellent game and an easy recommend for fans of the series. However the level of difficulty is pretty high which makes it harder to recommend to those who aren’t familiar with either the series or the genre.',\n",

       "  'description': \"No matter what you make of the game's controversial sexual content (which is pretty weak compared to a lot of stuff, much of which you can see on TV), BioWare's Mass Effect offers a great gaming experience for fans of RPGs and those, like myself, who are somewhat unfamiliar with the genre as a whole. The universe (or rather the galaxy) created here is immersive and interesting, ensuring that anyone taking a trip into BioWare's space epic is sure to return. You start the game by creating a character. You can make the character look as ugly as you want, you can give him or her any first name, and you can choose from a number of classes which will shape how you play later in the game. The only prerequisite is that the character's last name is Shepard. So, I proceeded to use the creator, which is surprisingly robust, to create a cross between Vin Diesel and Bruce Willis, naming my future Spectre Bruce Shepard. I chose the soldier class, which is more about shooting than using special abilities. Other classes include a biotic power class and a engineer class along with many hybrid classes.The game has a distinctive art style that will remind you a lot of movies like Star Wars and the Terminator. The film grain is a nice touch, but you can turn it off if you don't agree with me. The framerate, however, is not as nice to look at. It sputters pretty much all the time and can get in the way of combat a bit. Also, there is a great deal of texture pop-in which you sure to notice. Only the first hurts the game's playability at all, and it only hurts it a little bit. You'll eventually get used to it, but it would be nice if it had been cleaned up. It's also worth mentioning that the sound of this game is amazing, mixing superb voice acting with a movie quality soundtrack.The gameplay in Mass Effect is robust and, above all, fun. Just plain shooting fools is fun, which I did a lot thanks to my class choice. But, if shooting guys isn't your deal then the other classes will help you take a different approach to battles. You have a team that you must balance and equip in order to succeed. Upgrading each member of your team as well as yourself is paramount to your experience. Also, finding new guns and equipment and gaining new abilities drive you forward in your play. The main sections, where the story is front and center, are gripping and intense. Side missions, while not as intense, are still addictive, even if they get repetitive. The game's story is great. The dialogue tree that BioWare has come up with really makes your communication easy, while still keeping a great amount of depth. There a great number of twists and turns as well as major, major events that will force Shepard to make a choice. Be careful, however, as your choices are permanent and if you make the wrong one, you may never see one of your team members again. The game's ending is also one of the best ever. Your choice at the end can set up drastically different futures for Shepard and the human race. I have never been an RPG fan, but if all RPGs were like Mass Effect, I would be a fanboy. Thank you BioWare, let's hope you keep it going next time. \",\n",

       "  'description': 'Most people are saying this game is really bad and just a user mod for Half-Life 2. Well, I’m guessing most of these people went into the game thinking it was bad. I never did finish the first SiN because I didn’t like it but, this one after the first 20min it started to grow on me. I mean people buy this game give it a chance and you will have fun with it. Although word of warning, if you aren’t the best gamer in the world I would tone the difficulty down a whole lot, do this and you should be fine.  The first thing I liked about this game was that it has an awesome soundtrack and main menu. The music on the menu is very cool and I tried to get into the files and find it to add it to Itunes. Now when you actually get in the game you will notice that the graphics of this game are very stylized. Some people saw this as bad graphics and that the source engine was aging. No it is stylized graphics and you all need to get use to it. Now I will admit that there could have been some higher resolution textures and some of the non-main characters could actually be render well, with those and HDR added the graphics I’m sure would be phenomenal. (Ritual also make the game more detailed please) Other than that I gave the graphics an 8 because there are times when they look good and times when they look bad.  Now game play is another factor. Personally I liked going to a game that had some good shooting in it, instead of strategic game play. For most of the game I had a whole lot of fun blasting enemies and taking people down with the awesome shotgun. SiN: Emergence Episodes can be very hard especially near the end. Otherwise I gave game play a 10 especially with the secondary fire on the shotgun makes it really fun. The Sound in this game is a very nice techno style and only plays during high points of the game, which is a plus.   My thought on this game is that it is a very fun and good game. Just ritual should spend more time adding detail to the textures, making textures run at higher resolution, improving non-main character rendering and add HDR and the graphics will get a 10. This game is fun, addicting, and very hard so it will keep you busy. Ritual does deliver and for around $20 for a 4 to 5, 5 hours game for me. It is worth it. I don’t suggest playing the original SiN it’s horrible. So people please buy SiN Episode: Emergence and go into with a positive attitude and I promise you will have fun if you have a good attitude with it.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Gears of War is an amazing playing shooter from developer Epic Games. Let’s get this out of the way right now: this game is nothing short of a masterpiece. The great control scheme and amazing sound and graphics make Gears a must-have and the first true “killer-app” for the Xbox 360. Gears of War starts of when your character Marcus Fenix is busted out of prison by his buddy Dominic Santiago, after going through this training level getting to the chopper the story’s biggest plot point is reviled to you. You must find Alpha-Squad rescue them and the Resonator and use it. The game doesn’t really do that well with the story after that cut-scene and misses lots of opportunities to tell you about its characters and honestly doesn’t even really do a great job setting the stage for the game’s world or events. Of course all you really need to know is the Locust Horde came from underground, they are trying to kill you and you have to stay behind cover, but the story could have been pretty cool if it had done a few things differently.  Of course you usually don’t play a shooter for its storyline, you play a shooter to shoot things and Gears does that damn well. The main mechanic of Gears is “stop and pop” in other words hide behind pillars, walls, cars, slabs of concrete, basically pretty much anything that can stop bullets and then pop up to fire well setup shots and then get back down. All this stopping and popping is handled by the “A” button on the 360 controller. It does everything from having you sprint (which I’ll get to more in a bit), slam or slide into cover, vault low walls, swat-turn between to adjacent pieces of cover, to doing evasive rolls. Once you get in to cover it is just a matter of locating an enemy and pressing the left trigger to get a bead on him (in fact if you don’t press the aiming trigger you don’t get a reticule and your shots will be highly inaccurate) and fire away while you can. If you are not in cover you are going to get killed and fast. The enemies are pretty accurate with their shots even on the Causal (easiest) difficulty and on Hardcore you are as good as dead if you can’t find cover in more than five or so seconds when under heavy fire.  The health system works hand in hand with the cover system, when you get shot you’ll see a red gear (called the crimson omen) appear in the middle of your view, the fuller it gets the closer you are to death. So what you have to do is take cover and you will simply and quickly regenerate your health. It’s a great system that allows you to feel threatened by your enemies, but at the same time never get in to a situation that you can’t get out of. The other great mechanic during battle is the active reload system. To reload you simply press the right bumper and you can wait for your character to reload his gun, but it can be more skilled than that. Once you press RB you get a little meter under your ammo counter HUD. A line passes through this meter which has a gray sweet spot which allows you to reload faster if you press RB again within it, inside that gray spot is a white zone which a perfect reload that gives those freshly loaded bullets a temporary double damage bonus. Of course, if you miss before or after the sweet spot, you jam your gun and it takes twice as long to reload than it would have if you didn’t press RB again. It seems simple enough and like something that you would master quickly, but in the heat of battle it is still easy to jam your gun from time to time, which makes things much more interesting.  With reloading in mind, the guns in Gears of War are all pretty powerful and exiting to use, some of them aren’t that creative as there are typical stuff like a shotgun, sniper rifle and a pistol (though the revolver pistol is nice), but there are two big unique standout guns: the Lancer Assault Rifle and the Hammer of Dawn. The Lancer isn’t totally special on its own, though it will be the main gun of your small four weapon arsenal; it’s special because it has a chainsaw bayonet. Yes, that is as awesome as it sounds, if you can manage to get close (or sneak up) to a Locust, you can drive that sucker right through him making a scene of carnage that splatters the screen with blood, leaves your foe a pile of pieces on the floor and you highly satisfied, though you have to be careful the AI won’t just let you walk up to them, you need just the right situation, like say, when your opponent is reloading his gun. The Hammer of Dawn has a limited use in the Campaign mode because you need just the right situation to use it as it uses an orbital satellite to rain down a firey beam from the sky. So you need open sky and for the satellite to be overhead. It mainly used to take down big enemies which are invulnerable to your bullets.  In Gears you can carry four weapons, two of the bigger guns (the Lancer, shotgun, sniper rifle, boom-shot (rocket launcher) or hammer of dawn), a pistol (snub or revolver) and hand grenades. Each gun has a melee attack, with the Lancer’s being the chainsaw, the grenades can also be used as a melee attack, in that case you will tag your opponent with it and he’ll go boom in a few seconds.  Joining you in the action is the Delta-Squad which includes you as Marcus Fenix and three other big tough dudes (Baird, Augustus “The Cole Train” Cole and Dom Santiago). These guys are great characters, but they aren’t super effective fighters and will get downed a lot. If one of your squad-mates gets downed you can run up him if you have a chance and press the X button to help him up. Of course that doesn’t work for you, if you get shot too much you are dead. After the first act of the game’s campaign you can give these guys three simple orders: regroup, attack and cease fire. The campaign itself is really great and really exciting, the AI is pretty smart (though occasionally they will fail to move if they aren’t completely in cover and getting hit) and challenging (even on casual at times) and all the areas are well designed (with a great checkpoint system) and the boss fights are pretty exciting as well. It takes about 10 hours to finish, but you will want to play through it again and again, because it is so exciting, intense and the areas are so diverse.  The multiplayer in Gears is also really great and helps to perfectly fill out the package. You can play the campaign over Xbox Live or using split screen and the beautiful thing is you can do this at any point in the campaign. Your friend (who will play as Dominic) could join you for one tough area, then leave and you could reload that save and play by yourself from that point. The other difference to playing the campaign co-op is that you can revive each other the same way I mentioned you could with your AI squad-mates, it makes things on the harder difficulties much more manageable. The other difference is that during the campaign (in both solo and co-op) there are some branching paths where Marcus and Dom will have to split-up if either you die during this time (in co-op) the game ends. This keeps it from having one player carry the whole fight, so both players will need to be able to fight well to win.  The other aspect to the multiplayer in Gears of War is the Versus mode which is team 4on4 deathmatch, last man standing wins. This mode is great for some quick action and houses three different game types: Warzone (plain team deathmatch), Assassination (your team must kill the other team’s leader to win) and Execution (when you are downed you can mash your A button to get back up, so you must execute your kills via the satisfying curb-stomp, shooting him more or decimating him). The Versus brings a different style to Gears, but unfortunately because of the need to “finish” kills and the reviving aspect the games almost consist of no shooting (except for the occasional headshot with sniper rifle) and are all about maneuvering to get in to position to chainsaw or shotgun your opponent at close range. The grenade tag move also plays a big part in this “no-shoot” aspect of the Versus mode. It’s overall pretty fun, but unless you agree to play “properly” you are going to get tagged a lot or see very few shots fired.  The graphics are another shining aspect of Gears of War, they are simply spectacular and pretty much perfect. This is the best looking game to date on the 360 and pretty much ever really. The detail in everything is so tremendous. The characters models themselves are heavy looking with fine details like scars on their faces and the deep red thick blood that flies from bullet hits is pretty amazing looking. The world around though, is going to cause your jaw to drop at least a few times, for instance the rain-storm at the beginning of Act 3 is one of the most amazing looking areas I have ever seen. The rain water rolling down the trees, buildings and pouring off the overhangs is all stunning. Not to overlook the other areas, because they all have amazing looks, from the glowing immultion in the underground to the amazing train sequence at the end of the game and even the camera angles bring you right in to the action, like, the amazing “roadie run” camera angle which is a low and bouncy angle so immersing that you will feel the urge to put your head down too as your character runs to the next cover spot, it’s all tremendous in HD or in SD.  Gears of War’s sound is also top-notch. The music is really well orchestrated and really adds to the atmosphere of the game. You’ll know when there are enemies around when the music starts getting frantic and you’ll know when you’re are safe when you hear the clear jingle and the music quietens down. But the sound effects are where the game really excels though. The guns all sound super powerful and the aural cues, like the clicking of a low on ammo gun or a the sound of a bouncing frag-grenade will be key to your success. When playing with headphones or I assume on a good surround system, the ambient sound effect really help you keep aware, while making you jump when things are calm and tense. And the chainsaw makes a grotesque revving and squishing slicing sound that is super satisfying and completely disgusting at the same time. The character voices are well suited especially with the Delta-Squad, they will naturally banter back and forth when they have a free moment, trash talk the enemy and just yell stuff that big dudes with guns yell.  In the end Gears of War is nearly a perfect title, the graphics, sounds and gameplay all come together to create an amazingly exciting and intense action experience, single player or multiplayer. The shortish campaign and the odd “no shoot” action in the multiplayer hurt the game a bit, but overall this is a game that not a single 360 owner should miss and if you don’t have a 360 this is the game is a reason to get one.',\n",

       "  'description': 'PlotRatchet and Clank: up Your Arsenal continues the adventures of Ratchet and Clank as they adventure through even more planets to save all organic life in the galaxy. The duo team up with Captain Qwark (the antagonist of their last adventure) and his newly assembled Q-force (consisting of a bunch of misfit individuals, and a monkey) as they try to take down Dr. Nefarious who\\'s aim is to delete all organic life in the galaxy, or as he calls them \"squishies\" GameplayThe Gameplay in R & C: UYA is reminiscent of the last game in the series but adds a few new control setups which bring a fresh breath of air for more action oriented game players. If you\\'ve never played that game then the gameplay consists of a combination of using your wrench for melee combat and lots of guns that you use to effectively destroy the galxy\\'s threat. The guns have a finite amount of upgrades that increase fire power, range, effectiveness, etc. The game also keeps its platforming roots,but does stray away from that in a big way opting for more action in it\\'s place. The game also has mini-games in the form of side-scrolling Qwark challenges and puzzle elements to break up the action which keeps the game both varied and well paced in a way that adds fun and all around pacing. Replay The amount of replay value that is in this game can be endless given your taste in the weapons in the game and the action you enjoy. There are Titanium Bolts that can be found on each planet that give you access to cheats that can make your head bigger, or make your wrench a \"lightsaber\". There are also skill points to be earned on each planet for doing various tasks that you can use to get different skins for Ratchet such as a snowman skin. There is also online play that takes popular online variants such as Deathmatch or Capture the flag and effectively puts them into Ratchet and Clank gameplay mechanics. In other words if you enjoy Ratchet and Clank you will be playing this game for months or even years, literally.Overview In so many words this game is THE defining game in the Ratchet and Clank series of games and brings things to platforming games that brings a breath of fresh air for those wanting more action in their platforming games, and has enough replay value to keep you entertained for a long time.',\n",

       " {'deck': 'WTF / Byte Hell Review',\n",
       "  'description': '|| This review was written when the game was only available in Japan ||The internet\\xa0is often home to many cult crazes that are enthusiastically received by rabid gamers. Trivia Robot, Jonny Moseley, Button Mashing, anything Katamari, and any of Jeff\\'s hairstyles to name but a few. However, this latest one was the first to make me go out and part with my hard earned cash. After seeing some gameplay footage \"on the spot\", I immediately went to eBay to secure myself a copy of Byte Hell. Being a UK resident and speaking zilcho Japanese means importing from Japan has never been my thing. Including shipping and handling, it cost me £29.98 to get Byte Hell, a PSP game retails in this country at either £34.99 or £39.99, so it was less than full-price. Byte hell basically has you sent to the fiery pits of hell, but not to be prodded by pitch-forks, or tortured by fire, instead your torture will come in the form of menial and mundane tasks. These \"tasks\" are infact mini-games that carry feature simple 2-3 button gameplay, a lot of humour, and a lot of repetition. Watching the gameplay footage of the game, it was clear it was fairly text heavy. Speaking no Japanese, I had doubts as to how I\\'d be able to get my head around the game. To my surprise, upon opening the game, enclosed was an English translation of the instructions. Although this was about as well translated as your average Korean-made DVD player instructions, it certainly helped with the Wi-Fi aspects of the game, such as game sharing and item trading. (not that you\\'ll find anyone else with this game...ever.) The individual mini-games must be figured out on a game-by-game basis... but after you\\'ve figured out 4 or 5, you generally come around to the developer\\'s way of thinking (that is...insanity) and it becomes easier to figure out what you have to do. Byte Hell\\'s best characteristic however is it\\'s pickup and play gamestyle. I, like many people, use my PSP mainly for it\\'s media functions. Very rarely having the motivation to load up a game, to be faced with the usual huge loading times, and eye-squinting graphics. However, Byte Hell changes that. With super quick loading times and games that can last from 10 seconds to infinite (pen capping, anyone?) and with the constant contribution of money that can be used to buy more games, even the smallest game session rewards you. This really motivates you to boot up the game more, and when you do boot up the game, the addictive nature of the mini-games prevents you from putting it down. The games also have a habit of passing time quickly... perfect if your waiting for a bus, or on a long journey. (however, I wouldn\\'t recommend chopping logs for an entire long-haul flight from London to Dubai...) Byte Hell also features several \"tools.\" Whether these were intended as simple jokes from the developers, or they were deluded enough to think people would actually find them useful; is a matter for debate. However, Byte Hell is the kind of game you just store in your PSP, therefore it\\'s toolbox could prove handy. If you take your PSP everywhere for it\\'s MP3 functions, but just happen to keep Byte Hell inside, then the tools are always on you, so in a zany kinda way, the toolbox kind of makes sense. The tools range from horoscopes to the legendary \"Ramen Timer\" but some, such as the lottery number generator could perhaps be useful. All in all Byte Hell is a cult craze that just so happens to be backed by some good gameplay. If you find your PSP being used less and less for games, then Byte Hell may be the game that changes that. It remains to be seen if the repetitiveness will cause the game to become a bore, but there\\'s certainly a lot to unlock, and hell... when it\\'s all unlocked... you can kick back and eat some quality ramen!',\n",

       "  'description': 'SiN…the modern review.  Well the only reason I bought the original SiN is because I pre-purchased for SiN Episodes: Emergence for $20. With that you get SiN, SiN Multiplayer and Sin Episodes: Emergence. Also since I pre-purchased over STEAM I got it for $17. I would like to talk about this game even though I doubt anyone will read this review. One note that when I review this game I will be judging it based off of other games made in 1998 other than Half-Life.   This game starts you out as John A. Blade a hardcorps officer that is helping to take down Sintek. In the first level you will notice that you get to ride around in a helicopter and shoot down the enemy, that’s fun. The guns do some cool stuff, that’s fun. Shooting everything in your way and saving hostages or choosing to kill them also, that’s fun. What’s not fun is insane logic when trying to figure out puzzles. Stupid AI that can take a beating, that’s not fun. Not being able to see the game in some places because the lighting is bad, that’s not fun. Talking to bums randomly, that’s fun and cool. The menu for this game just sucks.   Gameplay I will say is solid with minor issues, its old school, run around and kill everything to progress a story that is actually interesting. Yes, the fact that you are pursuing a very busty woman who runs the company SiNtek is cool. Graphics at the time were ok, they weren’t Half-Life but they weren’t bad. Music in this game is something to want, with techno beats through the whole game you don’t even need to play the game. This review will jump around since this game is old and I’m only reviewing it because it’s the most recent game I bought. I’ll just say that the game is solid except for some AI problems, some bugs, the guns are big but, wimpy sounding, If you are in a need for a quick fix buy the game along with purchasing SiN Episodes: Emergence. I will have a full length review on May 13th just 4 days after it is released. Also I give this game an 8.1 just for its cost and the fact that it will give you a fix until SiN Episodes: Emergence comes out.',\n",

       "  'description': \"I have been anticipating Prey ever since it was first shown in it's new form a couple E3's ago. The demo was released a couple weeks before the game came out, and it just solidified my hype. Then the sad truth came out. The game is not as amazing as we all thought.  First off it's probably nice to talk about the good. Well the technology that has always been associated with the game works perfect. Portals, weird gravity etc all show up as promised. Without them the game would be very mediocre. Another feature in Prey is death. There basically is none. When you lose all of your health you play a short minigame where you shoot creatures to get your health back. In about 10 seconds your done and back right where you were. An interesting feature that makes the game a little too easy. The graphics are among the best on the PC and Xbox360 at this time, and the sound effects are hard hitting and fit well. The voice acting is good as well.  One aspect of the game that was reported on often was the main character Tommy. Who just happens to be Native American. That's just another innovation in the game. It's pretty rare to see a video game use Native Americans as main characters (despite the fact that its an alien invasion game). The story is nothing special. Tommy doesn't want to live on the reservation, but his girlfriend wants to stay. Out of nowhere aliens abduct Tommy, his girlfriend, and his grandfather. Tommy must set out to rescue them. Fairly straightforward, but it does have a few unique twists (that take their cue from some very good games) that some may not expect.  Despite the unique twists in the gameplay the feels like it's missing something. It could be because its very short, and very easy. The portals never really do anything really amazing beyond the first hour in the game. It really shows that this game could've used another 4 or 5 hours added on with some more unique puzzles. There isn't a ton of character interaction (Half-Life 2 any one?), so you don't really care for the character as much as you could. If what happens in this game involved the Half-Life 2 character it would've been far more effective (for example).  Another disappointing aspect is the multiplayer. It only allows for one player on screen and is extremely laggy with anymore than 5 players in one room. Precision can be very difficult even with only 2 people playing. There are few maps and only deathmatch modes. I don't want to dump on it anymore, but it would have been nice if they put time into developing a unique multiplayer that took advantage of the portal and gravity tech that they obviously worked a lot on.  Overall Prey is still a fun and unique game that will obviously spawn many similar games. For me it just goes to show how much Halo benefits from having a good multiplayer mode. Yes the game could've used some more time in the oven, but that shouldn't deter anyone from at least giving it a look.PROS+ Interesting and unique gameplay ideas+ Solid graphics+ Story has some unique ideasCONS- Portals not used to full potential- Gameplay becomes stale- Boring multiplayer\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Metal Gear Acid was the PSP\\'s launch title everyone had their eyes on- and many were thinking just what WAS Kojima thinking this time around? Overall, Metal Gear Acid is an enjoyable game that PSP owners won\\'t regret purchasing.Metal Gear Acid isn\\'t Metal Gear Solid. But it is Metal Gear. Let\\'s just look at our Metal Gear check list:Leone\\'s Metal Gear-Franchise Check-List™Focus on Stealth? Check.Over the top bosses? Check.Over the top plot? Check.METAL GEAR!? Check.As many people who were following the news about this game quickly found out though, it wasn\\'t the action game everyone thought it would be. Instead, Metal Gear Acid is a Turn Based Strategy game. \"Hm, well, it could work\" thinks Joe Anybody. But then everyone found out it was also a Collectible Card game. \"WHAT!?\" thinks Joe Anybody. It\\'s true, Metal Gear Acid is a Turn Based Collectible Card Strategy game. Or TBCCS. Go Kojima! Joking aside, I was hesitant like many others when I popped in this UMD along with my brand new PSP on launch, but after the obligatory long cutscenes, I grew to like the system. It worked, and that is all I asked for. It was different, to be sure, and there was a lot to figure out, but once you got it, it worked. And it worked well. That\\'s not to say this game is for everybody. It does take awhile to get used to everything, and learning the finer details of the system can be overwhelming at times, but it does add to the depth of the game. And for the completionists out there, there are two hundred and four cards to nab, so get going. One unfortunate fact is that this IS a collectible card game, and that entails the unrelenting storm of booster packs, and with no dedicated singles shop, collecting every card can be a long trial of resetting your PSP, or a lot of points spent getting countless duplicates.The story is told and broken up over missions that are revealed as you complete each one, and occasionally you have to backtrack with new equipment that you have obtained in order to further the story. Outside of the story though, you can repeat any mission for points and cards. Boss fights are exceptionally Metal Gear, large, bulking and often times bizare. Take my namesake for example: Leone is the leader of a mercenary group you encounter. He is a hulking man who can wield a PTRS1942 anti-tank rifle with one hand and use it to deflect bullets. Seriously, how many other franchises are there where you come to expect something like that?You\\'ll spend a lot of your time modifying, rebuilding, and adding to your deck to improve your efficiency in a mission. Once you\\'re in a mission, your deck is \"shuffled\" and you are dealt a hand of cards, any of which can be used during your turn. Cards range from movement (but all cards can act as a movement card, albeit not always wise to do so), COST reduction (COST is what governs the turn order- the higher your cost, the longer it\\'ll be until your next turn), weapons (anything from a katana to the RPG7 and Solar Gun), and character cards (with special abilities depending on who it is: IE Metal Gear REX will crush foes in a certain area, while Fortune will allow you to reflect bullets for a few turns). My main gripe is that sometimes you need a specific card to advance in a mission, so you\\'ll spend turns standing and discarding cards while you wait for it to come around.For a first generation PSP game, the visuals are tight and what you would come to expect from a Metal Gear game, and while there isn\\'t voice acting in most of the cutscenes (yup, text boxes are in), the music in game is nice, the cards have flashy sounds when you activate them, and character cards will generally have footage relating to that specific card when you activate it (All of which can be skipped if you\\'re getting sick of it) and everything else sounds as it should.If I could give this a 75%, I would because Metal Gear Ac!d definitely is not a game for everyone. I won\\'t beat around the bush, this is a \"Love or Hate\" kind of deal; you\\'ll either want it to get a 0 or a 5, so it is hard to assign a middle ground. But that doesn\\'t mean it is a bad game by any standard. It is a great game once you get into it and get the hang of things, and you will get a ton of playtime out of it, especially if you have a friend that has it as well because there is multiplayer which consists of mainly pitting your Snake and support character (AKA your deck), Teliko that you meet in the story against his (deck) in a duel to the death. Or something like that. ',\n",

       "  'description': 'What can I say about a game where it has a second title of “Oblivion?” Besides the fact that it is one of the best games of all time. I was a little bit skeptical when buying the game for one reason; I had played Morrowind at a friend’s house and never did get into it. Another note was I met almost all the recommended settings. The only thing I didn’t hit was the processor speed it suggested 3 GHz I have a 2.8 Dual Core. Then as I saw previews for it I decided I would buy it. Here is my official review of this game.  One thing I have to say is that installing the game went off without a single glitch, and it had one of the fastest install times I had seen even compared to the Call of Duty series. After installation the first thing I do is I of course boot the game up. The software told me I could run it on high settings. As I get into the game I notice some lag, so I toned down the settings a little, took off shadows, lighting except for bloom, and turn the textures to medium and that was it. As I do this I am thinking its going to look horrible now but no, not only does it not lag now it is still a gorgeous game. Also a note to some people I would turn all view distances as far as possible because that will get rid of lag.   Ok now to actually talk about graphics for this behemoth. This game will pull you into a beautiful age where trees are huge, deer run around, and water is crystal clear. I am serious about this. Lighting effects and shadows on the game looks even better, with the glistening of your sword, to the reflection of your hours on the pavement in the form of a dark shadow. All of it is surreal, and yes I shall beautiful. With lighting effects and shadows off everything still looks great. Secondly I would like to point out the musical score in this game is phenomenal and changes when you are in battle. Also weather changes in this game drastically, which adds some very nice atmospheres.  I would love to say more, but I’m sure you all would get it, I would of raved on how good the AI is, the combat, the Inventory as a panel, the worthiness of $50 as a price tag for the pc. The map of Cyrodil that comes with the collector’s edition and the regular edition. These entirely aside this game is great. If you have a decent pc go out and buy even if you can’t run it on all high settings. My only two complaints are that yes it does require a rather beastly machine and when the software tells you what settings you can run on, you may want to tone it down a little.',\n",

The primary \"Continuous Play\" mode offers a lot of granular control over the way your game plays: the size of the world, breadth of the islands, richness of resources, down to the purpose of your campaign: gaining immense wealth, developing the largest settlement, constructing the biggest castle, or even just gaining independence from England, plus a number of other choices.\\xa0 Set your conditions for victory, or have none at all: you decide how long the game lasts and whether or not you can \"win\".\\xa0   There are also Scenario and Playground modes for those that would like a more specific or simplistic approach to the gameplay.\\xa0\\xa0 The game offers 10 scenarios that increase in difficulty, providing various challenges from escaping a volcanic island to proving you worth to Ramirez, the infamous pirate captain, in a \"Baptism of Fire\" to earn the respect of the pirates.\\xa0 The playground mode offers a simple \"practice sandbox\" to explore different strategies of city development by allowing you to construct settlements on large islands at no cost or need for economic development.  The game also offers a lucrative multiplayer mode, employing Internet (GameSpy), LAN or direct connection options for up to 2 players (total), which can be very fun and rewarding--an atypical multiplayer \"sandbox\" experience if you can find a like-minded friend.  Continuous Mode seems to be the main focus of the game, offering epic-length experiences akin to \"4X\" games (eXpand, eXplore, eXploit and eXterminate), allowing for an open-ended experience.\\xa0 You will start the game with a single ship loaded with enough supplies to construct a coastal warehouse, forcing you to explore for the perfect starting island filled with just enough space and resources to give you the upper hand.\\xa0 Alternatively, you can choose to start with just a warehouse on a random island; the Queen of England will grant you a free trade ship once you have developed some of your people into \"Settlers\", the second tier of citizens (of five tiers).  As you develop your settlement, you’ll find the need to meet the increasing demands of your citizens as they acquire a taste for a better lifestyle, rewarding you in kind with greater tax income.\\xa0 Work the land to develop trade goods, and employ your ships to embark on trading routes to establish both good relations with other civilizations and gain greater wealth. 1701 A.D. is a highly overlooked game that can provide countless hours of entertainment—well worth the now bargain price given its November 2006 release.\\xa0 There’s a lot of content to enjoy and the player is given a lot of control over the way it plays, so if you’re a fan of the genre, chances are good that you can craft an experience to your liking.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Every now and then there comes a game that doesn\\'t revolutionize the gaming world but has enough in it that it is an instant hit. Call of duty 4 is such a game. Right from the onset on the game you will find yourself immersed in it. I had more fun in the first couple levels(The prologue) than I have ever had in a FPS before and that is saying a lot. The game makes you feel as though you are part of a team and what you are doing and experiencing is real.  You play the game through the eyes of an SAS member and a Marine Force Recon soldier. While you don\\'t learn a whole lot about them, the way the game is designed and the way the other characters interact with you makes you feel for these characters. This is achieved through a good Story line that has it\\'s share of surprises and then some. I wont ruin anything for anyone but I have to say that the set pieces in the story are some of the best. \"Walking\" through a city that had just been nuked is probably one of the best experiences that I have ever had in a game regardless of its genre. While the first half of the story is unpredictable and will literally have you grabbing the edge of your seat the game\\'s story line does become somewhat lackluster later on. However it still remains a visceral experience that will be enjoyed by many. The game still has a lot of sequences where you Run and gun in a manner of speaking but it also includes sections where you can get the real feel of an spec ops soldiers as you sneak around and shoot up people with your sniper rifle and your silenced rifle. My only complain would be that these parts are not too often and were much more enjoyable than the arcade style run and gun. However infinity ward has done an excellent job of throwing in multiple stuff in the game such as the AC-130 you get to control which was a lot of fun. There is also an arcade mode in the game and you can track your scores over XBL and compare them with your friends and people all over the world.  Online is probably the biggest part of COD4 and it rivals that of Halo3. Infinity ward has nailed the formula for success with COD4\\'s online mode which has everything from customizable/unlockable weapons to unlockable perks. It is easily one of the most deepest online modes on the planet. Also on a personal note it seems that there is a lot less of the immature kids on COD 4 compared to Halo 3 which makes the game that much more fun. The weapons react the way you would expect them to and you will feel as though you are a real soldier when you are playing this game. This is a must buy for anyone looking for a good game',\n",

       "  'description': 'Ok so when i first heard that Valve was going to go with an episodic model, so their games would be released sooner and would allow for a more TV model. Where their are cliffhangers and you can\\'t wait to play the next installment. Then after a while I started to think it was stupid. The length of the games was the main issue. If it was 5 hours and you would get the next installment soon... as in at most a month I would love the idea. The best part about shows like 24 and Lost is waiting to see whats going to happen. However, then I started to hear that Episode 2 and 3 would come out within 6 months each. Ugh I thought. This whole episodic thing is going to crash and burn, but after playing it I have eaten my own words. First off yes it took me around 4-5 hours to beat it. Yes my game crashed like hell many times because my PC hates Half-Life. I figured out the problem and fixed it so I\\'m not going to include that in my score.  Doing the game in a way where everything needs to have a point and there is no time to waste really helped this game out a lot. If it was slow paced in any way it would ruin it. And valve does not screw up in that department. Non stop action interwoven with great character moments. It\\'s so much fun to just watch the characters interact with the environment, each other, and sometimes even you. The animations are just amazing. Perfect lip sync and amazing voice acting really bring out the characters. Even more so than Half-Life 2 did. There are some really cool player controlled real time \"cutscenes\" that I won\\'t spoil, but be prepared to smile. Sure the game has all the same weapons from Half-Life 2, but really this is just the beginning in a trilogy of episodes. In the end the game does enough new things that it didn\\'t really matter to me. It of course ends a cliffhanger, though not in a huge story related manner. That aspect only comes in with the episode 2 teaser trailer.  Since this is based off of the Half-Life 2 engine almost entirely it does look a little dated when compared to games like Crysis. However Crysis isn\\'t even out yet. It\\'s pretty sad that no PC game has come along since Half-Life 2 and raised the bar any higher. There are some nice effects though added to the game. Not just the obvious stuff, but nice changes under the hood that you don\\'t really notice until you go back and play Half-Life 2.  Overall I think that this could turn out to be a very good little Trilogy. Where the sum of the parts could total to be longer and better than Half-Life 2 itself. If the teaser trailer for episode II is any indication the direction being taken is going to be a little different from Episode One which in the end should help with creating some new and fresh with each installment. Oh and there is the commentary track throughout the game. Very similar to the Riddick design, but sadly everyone is reading off of a piece of paper. Which makes the tracks much much shorter than Riddick and sound far to forced. I suppose they wanted to have a plan and give out useful information. But in the end the best part about Riddick was how the developers would just talk and say whatever came to mind about the subject. It was spontaneous, funny like a real commentary track should be. Yes you should prepare for what you are going to say, but don\\'t read from a script.  In the end the problems in the game really just didn\\'t matter to me. I having so much fun. The lack of vehicles and truly varied environments didn\\'t matter! The lack of anything really answered in the story didn\\'t matter either! In the end this is part of a bigger story, so at the moment i\\'m willing to let things go. I just hope it all ends up being worth it!',\n",

       " {'deck': 'dogsounds reviews: The Orange Box',\n",
       "  'description': 'So, having played Portal, I decided to turn my attention to the other constituents of Valve\\'s \"The Orange Box\": namely, Half-Life 2, Chapters 1 and 2 and Team Fortress.Firstly, let\\'s get this out of the way: I am not about to review Team Fortress fully as I have no interest in objective-based multiplayer. So I suspect I would find myself bored by it quickly, and this would not lead to a subjective review. All I can say is that I love the look and feeling of the game, and from the experiments I have carried out (on my own) on the maps, testing each character and the weapons and objectives, it seems to have a wonderfully dark humor to it. I also adore the characters - most notably the Slovak self-named \"Heavy Weapons Guy\" - and was impressed with the little \"Meet the...\" featurettes that are available on the web. You can see \"Meet The Heavy\" here: So I like the look and I like the off-the-wall humor. I fear I personally would not like the gametypes, but there are enough of you out there that would, so feel free to tell me what you thought.Right. On to the Half-Life contingent. Bear in mind that I played Half-Life 2 when it came out on the original Xbox, but I have played through the Orange Box version again, and base the review solely on this. For an overall review, I will treat all three instalments: Half-Life 2, Chapter One and Chapter Two as one single game, although Half-Life 2 was originally released for PC and Xbox way back when, and was added to the Xbox 360 backwards-compatibility list pretty sharpish. Chapters One and Two were released episodically for PC over Valve\\'s download service - Steam - as additional expansions, and further the story. However, lets get the chapter specific bits out of the way first. Half-Life 2 is essentially an identical port to the 360, in terms of gameplay, although the graphics have been updated to a subtle degree to get a bit more out of the system - there is more realistic lighting and some textures have been upgraded. Some character models - such as the Vortigaunts - have been given a level of polish and now look more \"realisitic\" and do not have the really crappy eyes that were so noticeable on the original Xbox version.Importantly, all the graphical glitches and frame-rate issues that plagued the Xbox version when played on an Xbox, and then the extra ones that apeared when played on the 360 as a backwards-compatible title, have been dealt with. The original Xbox release really pushed the old Xbox hardware, and sometimes it showed. But this new 360 version, for the most part, looks smooth, runs smooth and plays well. The frame rate does drop a little here and there, but not enough to diminish the experience. Sadly, Valve have not removed the endless loading screens that appear every 500 yards and stop the action dead in its tracks. Surely this should not even exist anymore? Come on.It is important to note though that this is not a game that can visually compete hands-down with current-gen games at the top of the league such as Call Of Duty 4, Halo 3 or BioShock. This game is a few years old, and still has low-poly models and some very nasty textures. But it still holds its own, and for the most part looks good.You can also notice the difference in visual qualiity in the later chapters, Chapter Two looking the best and much better than Half-Life 2 in many respects. But, in all chapters, there is still a gap between the best it has to offer and the best offered by current-gen games. This can be forgiven though, given the timespan of these games\\' original releases.For the overall review, I think I can safely break it down (\"it\" being all three instalments as one) into a small number of aspects to consider: story, gameplay, voice acting and audio. Let\\'s go.StoryEver since the original Half-Life, this franchise has excelled in the domain of the deep, engaging and thought-provoking storyline. The story in the original Half-Life was interesting enough, but Valve have created an even deeper, richer plot in Half-Life 2. Twenty years after the original game, the protagonist, physicist Gordon Freeman, is brought out of what appears to be some sort of nether-world stasis by the mysterious G-Man to carry out his next appointed task. Since Gordon\\'s resonance cascade at the Black Mesa facility in Half-Life, a portal link has opened up between Earth and the mysterious planet Xen and has brought us to the attention of a galactic evil empire: The Combine. Able to get to earth through the portal, the Combine were able to assault and begin enslavement of the Human race, defeating their feeble attempts at defence in the Seven Hours War. Since their defeat in this war, Humans have lived a miserable, 1984-esque existence, under the auspices of The Combine, who control their every move. The Combine\\'s ultimate goal is to absorb Humanity into their realm by supressing the ability to breed, restricting their freedoms and genetically altering humans to suit their needs. The Combine Overwatch - the military force of the Combine made of genetically-altered Humans - act as the police and surpressing force on the ground, and a \"supression field\" removes the ability to breed, giving the Humans a stark choice: give in to the Combine and acceed to their will, or die out. Add to this that both the Combine AND Humanity are also fighting against creatures that have come through the portal from Xen, and the Combine have harnessed some of these for their own purposes - such as the famous headcrabs - and Earth is not a dandy place to be!As Gordon Freeman, you start the game arriving in City 17, a large populace of subjugated humans run by the Combine forces, and governed by a Human puppet dicator - Dr. Breen. Dr.Breen was the head of Black Mesa, and now is lord of all he surveys over City 17, acting at the behest of the Combine and using policitical spin and propaganda to convince Humanity to give up its feeble resistance and follow the rule of the Combine - whom her refers to only as \"Our Benefactors\" - citing that they will allow us to transcend or feeble human existence and offer us our true destiny, remove the shackles of insitnctual behaviour and travel amongst the stars.Your task within the game is to hook up with and assist the resistance movement, to try and defeat the Combine attempts at subjugation, remove the supression field, and remove Breen from power. The resistance movement is struggling, and hope and faith are dwindling. Your prescence is seen as the motivational kick the resistance movement needs, and the rallying cry. But the Combine are also aware of the threat you pose.As far as stories and plots go, this is just the surface. There is an incredible level of depth, and what Valve have also done to enhance this is build it into the atmosphere and feel of the game and its settings. As you travel around City 17, for example, ever-present is the eerie and cold voice of the Overwatch - a female voice that seems to emanate from everywhere and issues commands and information to not only the Combine Overwatch troops and Civil Protection, but also to the populace in general. You have to hear the voice of the Overwatch really to get the feeling, but Ellen McLain (who also provided the voices of GLaDOS and the adorable turrets in portal) offers a wonderful, clinical English accent, and the dialog is officious and overbearing, almost medical. She often comments to the Gordon directly, calling him \"individual\" and saying that the \"anti-civil activity\" he has carried out has led to his \"citizen status\" being \"revoked\" (evetually you are renamed \"Anticitizen One\"). The Overwatch also directs citizens to report any anti-civil activity, and that failure to do so will result in restriction of rations or privileges. Combine forces are often directed in almost medical terminology, almost as if you are a virus and they white blood cells, with phrases such as \"Isolate; cauterize, sterliize\". It\\'s really hard to explain the Overwatch voice, but it gives the ambience a real 1984/Brazil feel to it, and works perfectly.The sense of opression and subjugation in the story is enhanced tenfold by the ambience and environment, and is utterly engaging.GameplayWell, I hate to say this to all you Half-Life devotees out there, but for me, this game is not what I would call fun, or engaging.Sadly, despite the fantastic story and plot, and the marvellous settings and ambience, the gameplay lets it all down. Thre seem to be only three different types of action: fight the Combine, fight the headcrabs and headcrab zombies, or fight the creatures from Xen (such as Antlions). And all these are interspersed with inane puzzles and uninteresting vehicle sections that go on for too long. Wash. Repeat. Rinse.Boring weapon mechanics make fighting the combine an unintersting chore. Vehicle sections which show potential end up as nothing more than a quick way to get to the next tedious fighting section, and they last just too long (the dune buggy section on Half-Life 2 just goes on and on and on), and with the addition of not the most fantastic vehicle control scheme, it becomes a pain.Fighting Combine is usually a case of \"stay a long way away and use your pistol\", and up close the AI is not that fantastic. The Combine generally stand there and let you take them out. For example, there is a section in the Nova Prospekt level where, on first play, you will feel overwhelmed and struggle to survive, until you realise that you can simply jam yourself into a pokey little corner and safely stand there with your shotgun, blasting each enemy as he walks up and faces you - as they ALL will. You will be alive, there will be no challenge, and there will be a huge pile of dead dudes in one spot. This is generally how Combine combat unfolds.In the ubiquitous headcrab zombie sections, you will find yourself growing more and more bored fighting off the shambling zombies who all apparently all shop at the same clothing store. Even the fun of the Gravity Gun and using ripsaw blades as weapons do not alleviate the tedium. The whole \"We Don\\'t Go To Ravenholm\" level is just awful, and like the vehicle sections, goes on for ever.And the Xen creatures? Antlions are horse-sized insects that sense vibrations in the floor and pop out of loose ground to attack you, at speed. A single shotgun blast will take them out, and there is no fun to be had doing so. The whole sequence in Half-Life 2 where you have lost the dune buggy and have to traverse the beach using objects and the gravity gun to make safe walkways and stay off the sand had me wanting to throw my controller against the wall. And don\\'t get me started on the garage sections in Chapter One or the underground hive sections in Chapter Two.So pretty bad huh? Well, wait, it gets worse. Permeating almost all of the levels are the damn puzzles. Puzzles are not a bad thing, and Half-Life is known for them. They were fine in the original Half-Life - get past these trip mines, figure out how to get from here to here, that sort of thing. Which was fine, and new and shiny at the time. But from Half-Life 2 onwards, they seem contrived, pointless and appear as nothing more than an excuse to show off the Havok Physics engine. Oh look, another inconceivably unlikely see-saw puzzle! Gimme a break. They are endless, and never really seem to fit. At one point in Chapter Two, even your Vortigaunt ally, when faced with a puzzle, leaves it to you, saying in effect (I am paraphrasing here) \"Oooh look, here\\'s a ridiculous puzzle, I\\'ll leave that to you then, as that is what the Freeman is known for.\" I am not averse to pulling a lever here or pressing a button there, but so many of these puzzles seem so silly when you see them over and over again that they start to get annoying. We know you have a funky physics engine. Now get over it, and give me some gameplay back.The sad thing is that there are so many things that make the gameplay uninteresting that it makes the game something very bad: it makes it not fun, and boring. When shooting is boring, and AI is dumb, and puzzles are pointless, and more often than not you are frustrated by contrivances and unclear map design, you simply want to give up. And in the end, I did. I have not finished Chapter Two, and I might not ever. I am debating whether to use a cheat to get past the hive section I am on now, which is, frankly, boring me\\xa0shtless and frustrating as hell (run out, die, run out, die, run out, die ad nauseam).Voice Acting / AudioFor the main characters, voice acting is fantastic. With great voice talent such as Robert Culp for Dr. Breen, Valve have done a marvellous job.Sadly, with minor characters, the result is FAIL. There seem to be two voice actors to represent all the male, non-main story characters (the resistance fighters). And, incidentally, only about four different male faces and one female. Which means that the black dude speaks with the same voice as the white dude, and often two dudes having a conversation will have the same voice, and look the same. This just sucks. For the amount of effort and immersion that has ben put into the other characters and audio, to see an endless stream of NPC\\'s with a total of two voices is just bloody awful, and destroys the immersion completely. Not to mention the limited number of phrases they actually have.Audio, at least, is excellent throughout. I have mentioned the Combine Overwatch, but generally through all three instalments, audio is top-notch, engaging, and enthralling. From the ambient sounds of City 17, the \"whoompwhaaaa\" of the thumpers, distant sounds of Combine activity and even the garbled radio-speak of the Overwatch forces and Civil Protection, it is all wonderful. I cannot fault it.So, in conclusion...as it is late and I need to sleep.I feel and understand the passion that Half-Life garners, and this is in no small part to the premise and deep, enthralling plot and well-crafted ambience. But, I can\\'t help feel that although this pulls me in more than most other games out there, the gameplay itself then slaps me back out. With so many long, drawn-out and tedious sections, and with such little satisfying play to be had, I really wonder how the developers at Valve enjoyed this? If I had been a tester for Valve, being forced to play most of these levels would have caused me to walk out.Jaime Griesemier at Bungie is famous for saying that a good game taps into the \"30 seconds of fun\" ethic, and repeats it over and over.Sadly, all Valve seem to have tapped into is 30 seconds of \"Christ, how much longer?\"Don\\'t get me wrong - for the sheer amount of stuff you get in The Orange Box, it\\'s a fantastic deal. And although the Half-Life contingent may be one of the deepest yet most tedious games out there, Portal alone makes this compilation worth the purchase. And if you have never played Half-Life, you should give it a go.  Tastes differ, it might just be your bag.',\n",

       "  'description': \"The first thing you notice when playing Daxter is the graphics. They are simply amazing. If it wasn't for Tekken this would be by far the best looking game on the PSP. The environments are large, the cutscenes are beautiful, and the framerate stays fairly consistent. While the world isn't as big as Jak II and 3 for a PSP game about a little fuzzy guy not half the size of the regular people it's big enough.  Gameplay in Daxter consists of the familiar platforming and vehicular levels from previous Jak games. Also returning are the context sensitive minigames (some being parodies of popular films). To add to the familiar Ready At Dawn has given Daxter his own set of abilities. Since Daxter is a exterminator you are given a bug spray jetpack of sorts. Most of the combat revolves around you using the spray to knock an enemy out then using your fists or body to destroy them. It's not something amazing or new, but it is a nice change from the prior Jak games. Progression however, plays out very much like Jak II and 3 did. You have an overworld where you can ride a scooter to each mission that comes up. Cutscenes divide up each mission like they always have, and the quality of them is right up there with the PS2 games. Voice acting is amazing as always. The story in these scenes is obviously not as fleshed out as the rest (the game takes place between Jak 1 and 2), but it serves its purpose.  The one obvious bad aspect in the game is that it's pretty short. The previous Jak games have never been really long (average around 10 hours), but they did have quite a bit of things to collect extras to unlock. Daxter will take you around 5-6 hours to complete and its extras are very simple to get. The length issue is fairly big since this is a portable game that needs some replay value. There is a 2 player bug combat game, but the chances of finding someone else with a copy of the game and a PSP are slim.  So if you are a fan of the Jak series, or just looking for a good PSP game then Daxter should be one of your first stops.  PROS + Amazing graphics + Nice looking cutscenes with great voice acting + Large world that stays true to the PS2 games + It's actually fun to collect things (I have no idea why)  CONS - Some minor framerate problems - Very short - Weak multiplayer - Stripped down story\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Final Fantasy XI is the first, and currently only, chapter in the Final Fantasy series to be an MMORPG.\\xa0 As such, the criticism of making a numbered entry in the series go such a radical direction is very high, but you discover as you play, that this title is deserving of it\\'s place in the franchise.  The game comes as part of Square Enix\\'s online service, PlayOnline, so with FFXI comes the PlayOnline Viewer, the game launcher/patcher program that\\'s a bit clunky, and it\\'s presence has been called into question by the player base from the onset.  Once you get past the Viewer, you create a character to place into the games virtual world known as Vana\\'diel. A world that has seen it\\'s far share of war, strife, and fragile alliances.\\xa0 The character customization is is not as limited as some other MMOs. You have your choice of 8 races, 8 facetypes for each, 2 hair colors, and 3 sizes from each of those.\\xa0 You also choose your starting job out of 6 Final Fantasy standard classes: Warrior, Monk, White Mage, Black Mage, Red Mage or Thief), and you choose your home nation from the three available choices.  After a brief introductory cut scene, you are placed into the game world, and the high barrier of entry becomes evident.\\xa0 Unlike other MMOs, there are no specific quest giver NPCs, and there are no \"!\" flags above NPCs related to any quests you are currently undertaking. This makes performing the many quests available in the areas a test of trial, error, and patience. And the rewards for many quests can seem very underwhelming.  Something you will notice quickly is the game looks very dated, and for good reason. FFXI is a 6 1/2 year old PS2 game ported to the PC, and the game engine shows it\\'s age when compared to other MMOs like Age of Conan. If you adjust your game settings through registry editing, you can get your game looking pretty good, but having to take such extreme steps shows the age of the game engine. Players have asked for a refresh of the game to cater to the better PCs available today, but Square Enix has said that they wish to keep all three versions of the game as close as possible to one another, so the game stays true to it\\'s lowest end, the PlayStation 2 version.  Battles in Vana\\'diel are done in a similar vein to the original Everquest. You select your target, select the \"Attack\" command, and you begin to auto attack.\\xa0 You do have choices available while battling, such as casting offensive or defensive magic, or using job specific abilities to help swing the tide of battle, and these help add a sense of interactivity to battles other than being an auto attack fest.\\xa0 Battles are the main way of collecting experience points in Final Fantasy XI, and you will learn after level 10 that battles will become much more difficult on your own. This is where you are introduce yourself to the party system, where you and up to 5 other players can fight as a group against tougher monsters together to gain higher EXP quicker than you would if you are on your own.\\xa0 There are only two viable job classes in which you could play solo and gain experience at a decent pace, those being Beastmaster and Puppetmaster.\\xa0 In realizing this, you can see how the developers very much put the emphasis on community and working together to advance.\\xa0 This could be seen as a positive, as you are encouraged to work together as a team, and can also make friendships with people would would not have met otherwise. But, this can also be an issue as, at this point, many of the current 500,000+ players of FFXI currently have higher level characters, so finding groups pre-level 50 can be test of your patience, and can be aggravating.  As you progress, you can begin taking part in missions for your nation. This is the beginning of where FFXI shines above many of the MMOs available, as the story lines in each nation, and the expansion packs, are truly magnificent. The characters are memorable and likable, and the stories told are engaging and true to the Final Fantasy scope of being epic in nature.  Also in the game, you will see many staples of the Final Fantasy series, such as Chocobo\\'s, Moogles, Cid and his airships, Cactuar\\'s, Avatars (Ifrit, Shiva, etc.), and much more.  So in closing, Final Fantasy XI is obviously not a title for everyone. The high barrier of entry for the game, makes it quite difficult for new players to get a foothold into the deep world of Vana\\'diel, and the older game engine can make it difficult to enjoy the surroundings, but if you can make it through the tough beginnings, you are in for a Final Fantasy type adventure, that you can finally share with friends from around the world.',\n",

I am glad to see a game not take itself seriously and just have fun, because as a player it made it that much more enjoyable to pick up the controller. The overall presentation is a mix of artsy and retro which works out very well. The wii remote is incorporated nicely as the motion controls are used sparingly so that you still get motion action without ruining the control scheme.

The only problem the non gamer might have with this is the price.

       "  'description': \"Kingdom Hearts II starts off very promising. From the amazing opening music video style intro to the long as hell character introductions and back story (Took me about 4 hours) the game doesn't falter too much. The voice acting is good new characters aren't annoying or dull. Thats just the beginning though. Then you start to get into the real game. The Disney stuff starts to pick up and things start to dive. Unlike the first game where the Disney aspects helped the game. In KHII Disney pulls the game back. The animations and voice work (for the most part) are amazing. There is no denying that. However, they try far to hard to sell a silly half-hearted message in each world you visit. If each world was a full on 1 hour movie it would work out ok. However they have less than 20 minutes of characters moments, so in the end you just don't care what anyone has to say. All this time you are hoping for the Sora story to come back into focus. What's really sad is that Sora's story is also handled poorly. From terrible jokes to awkward pauses the drama that is trying to get through just doesn't work. It's as if the game trying to be cute in some way. It's possible that something was lost in translation. After all Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children had the same problems.  Now onto the gameplay. Like the first game KH has always been an almost mindless button masher. However with the sequel they have added new battle options like Limits, Drives and context sensitive sequences similar to God of War and Resident Evil 4 into combat. While all it is is pressing triangle over and over I was still able to find it as a worthwhile addition. Another aspect improved has been the camera system. In a no-brainer move you can control the camera with the right analog stick (thank god!). Sadly when compared with the first game the levels are far too linear. Most worlds are just battlegrounds. You go from one loading screen to another encountering cutscenes after cutscene (I love cutscenes normally) battling enemies one after the other until you are done. Then onto the next world. There is basically zero exploration. Which for some I suppose could be a good thing. I will say that the game seems more focused as a result.  In what might be a surprise considering all the negative above I actually had a good amount of fun. Even though I felt like I was going through something familiar I didn't ever want to stop. I wanted to know what happened next. Despite the way I feel about the Disney stuff I enjoyed the Pooh Bear section (now he's actually cute), and it was fun to see black & white Mickey, Tron, and Pirates. It's just too bad that the cutscenes were for the most part boring. Give me some of that disney charm and I will love them. While aesthetically pleasing worked for the first game it just doesn't cut it here. If SquareEnix wants to please me (and it seems many fans too) Kingdom Hearts 3 is going to need to change things up a bit. In what seems fitting to say a cutscene can only go on so long without a heart before it becomes nothing.  PROS + Love the intro video and music + Amazing graphics and animations + A fairly lengthy game + Good choices in unique Disney worlds  CONS - Disney stuff just isn't working this time around - Story is pretty full of itself - A little too linear - Plenty of awkward cutscenes\",\n",

       "  'description': 'This game was one of the most hyped and anticipated games of 2007, it was promoted as a game where a wide open setting and an emotional roller coaster of a story were the main driving force . It came damn close to accomplishing both. From the moment you start the game you will be in awe of the graphics and the amount of interaction that takes place. Characters are beautifully modeled and the graphics rival that of any other game out there. Then again it is to be expected of a game that is running on the unreal3 engine. The audio in the game is exemplary, especially the voice acting. The audio complements the graphics very well as characters give very good performances and the weapon effects are good too. The opening cut scene puts the basic story in place and the developers take an unique approach when you \"make\" your character that is very refreshing.  The first mission is considered to be a tutorial of sorts but you can immediately see that Bioware put in considerable time and effort into the story. By the end of the first mission the game will have you saying \"hell no he did not do that/\" This in itself is a feat that has only been accomplished by few games; games in which the first level sets the bar for the rest of the game. Mass effect for the most part meets and or exceeds the bar that was set. My only complaint about the story was that if you have seen the trailers and the ad\\'s they give away some key plot elements. Still though its fun to be playing the game and get to a certain point and remember the ad and go \"This is going to happen now\". Just like every other RPG, ME also has a number of side quests, although the number of side quests might not exactly be mind boggling, they all for the most part have different plots and lots of different characters to interact and kill. Also, bioware has gone ahead and included unchartered worlds for you to explore. However, this is where things start to break down, most of the side quests take place on these uncharted worlds and most of the building and the caves you will fight in are the same models. In fact I think they only have about 4 kinds of building and caves. Over a period of time this gets incredibly annoying. Also, unlike the main plot which keeps you guessing and wanting more, the side quests dont really get you involved. The main reason for doing these side quests comes down to credits and leveling up, both of which can easily be achieved. This brings me to my next point; you will accumulate a lot of money by the end of the game and you will frankly not have much to spend on. Most of the weapons and ammo are already available from fallen enemies. This transitions to one of the worst aspects of mass effect, that is the inventory system. You automatically pick up weapons/ammo/grenades/mods from fallen enemies and there is no clear way of managing them. They are just clumped together in your inventory menu and if you reach 150 items you will be forced to convert the excess into omnigel, while this doesn\\'t seem bad consider that you do not get to chose what you convert to omni gel. Everything you pick up must be converted before you can move on and they cannot be dropped either. It seems like bioware really did not think this through.  Another problem is while the graphics are breathtaking to say the least, you will clearly see a lot of little quirks. Some times if you walk into an area you can see that the textures take a little while to load. However, this really isn\\'t much of an issue and you will hardly notice it. Another problem is that the MAKO driving part isn\\'t really that fun as I had helluva time controlling it. However, this is a personal opinion and must be taken with a grain of salt as you might like it.  The game isn\\'t exactly long considering other games(oblivion), clocking in at a little over 20 hours but it does offer lots of replayability. Also, the game offers up a tremendous amount of \"knowledge\"; knowledge in the sense that there are detailed manuals explaining every species and every technology(this info is in the codecs). So, Bioware has really tried to make this universe as believable as possible. With the upcoming downloadable content ME is going to offer up even more excitement. Overall it is a very solid game that will keep you entertained for hours.',\n",

       "  'description': 'The gameplay modes are modest at best. The obligatory Grand Prix, Versus, and Time Attack modes all make their standard appearances but are joined by the newfangled Story Mode this time around. Story mode basically puts the player into the cockpit of the Blue Falcon, piloted by none other than Captain Falcon himself. The \"story\" unfolds in a series of racing challenges that reveal the motivation behind this balls-to-the-wall racing competition, although it\\'s not any more engaging than you might expect. Apparantly Captain Falcon is some kind of good guy trying to thwart the plans of some bad guys who will stop at nothing to smite Falcon and unleash some manner of diabolical plot by racing in the F-Zero Grand Prix. Yawn. However, despite the forgivable lack of depth in the story (really, who wants to dwell on a complex storyline while speed-hovering at over 2000 KPH anyway?), gamers will find that the levels become downright challenging by the second mission, and all but impossible by the third. Truth be told, managing to complete the story is definately possible, although you probably won\\'t think so once you hit the Grand Prix challenge level.  The devilish challenge isn\\'t only limited to the Story mode though, so don\\'t think for a second you\\'ve got a bye. Predictably, in Grand Prix mode, tracks are separated into cups, are played in the same order each time, and will be more or less challenging based on the difficulty class you choose to play on. Whether you get third, second, first, or worse at the end of each cup is determined by how many points you have by that time, which are divied up among racers based on their place in each race. Better rank equals more points. Simple. Fortunately after only a few laps in the Novice class most gamers will find solid domination over the touchy controls and will be speeding by opponents with authority in no time, making themselves ready to move on to the more seriously competetive class levels -- Standard, Expert, and the unlockable Master classes.  Controlling your F-Zero craft is comparable to controlling a speeding bullet, only you can turn it. In fact, not only can you turn this bullet, but you can turn it very well. Before each race, you\\'re given the option to calibrate your craft in favor of faster acceleration or higher top speed. By adjusting a single line on a graph, you either increase or decrease your acceleration which inversely adjusts your top speed. Your turning capabilities are proportional to your accelerating status -- higher top speeds cost you some turning radius. Since you\\'re given a crude map of the course you\\'ll be racing prior to engine start, you can strategize whether you need mad top speed for straightaways, or rapid acceleration to offset unforgiving sharp turn sequences. As per tthe norm, the A button makes you go and the left analog stick controls your basic steering functions. Slam it all the way to the left or right for the most extreme turns or feather it for some fine-tuned maneuvering. F-Zero GX also includes the ability to use the shoulder buttons to sharpen turns to their relative sides, and the ability to powerslide through hairpin turns by depressing both of them at once. Powersliding will be much easier to do if your machine is calibrated towards acceleration over top speed, and will award you with a slight increase in speed for so long as you can hold the \\'slide. GX introduces offensive tactics into the franchise, affording you the option to either damage a handful of opponents by pressing the Z button along with directional input, sending you momentarily into a crazed spin, or by pressing right/left plus X to slam an opponent on your side. Your steering will be docked a bit in the area of accuracy for your troubles, but time it right and you can effectively eliminate the competition by sending them off course. Be on the lookout though, because the competition is out to eliminate you too, so don\\'t be surprised if you see these tactics being used against you as well. I think there\\'s a brake button too, but who cares? All the customization, finesse, and pinpoint accuracy come together to make for some strategic methodology to your game.  In the Grand Prix mode, the only way to end a race other than winning is by depleting your machine\\'s shield unto your explosive demise or by choosing to restart the level due to unacceptable personal performance. The amount of times you can restart is limited, further adding to the steep challenge served up. More often than not you\\'ll boost yourself to death rather than simply choose to restart a race. After the first lap, each racer\\'s boosts are activated, and by pressing the Y button you can warp speed yourself to ungodly velocities. The boost effect can be used for as often as you have power left in your shield (indicated by an on-screen display). Balancing between boosting to keep up with the competition and maintaining a safety net for steering errors is usually what makes the difference between sweet success and fiery failure in this game. It\\'s very good that your shield can be replenished, often completely, simply by cruising over strips of, I don\\'t know, colorful shield-replenishing road material found in long strips about the courses. Don\\'t ask me, it\\'s the future.  Time Attack and Versus modes are no more than you\\'d expect from any racer to date. Time Attack mode pits you against the clock to vie for the best overall time on a given track. Stats for max speed and best lap are automatically recorded as well. Versus mode falls short of greatness simply because the maximum amount of racers is limited to an underwhelming total of four. That\\'s it -- you and three friends, tops. The frenetic feel of Grand Prix mode is almost completely diminished unless you\\'re playing friends of comparable skill level. Even then, you\\'d likely have more fun just swapping the controller back and forth going through the Grand Prix and Story modes together.  There is also an option to build a custom craft by buying an ensemble of parts from the parts store available at the beginning of the game. The parts are bought with tickets earned by completing challenges in Grand Prix and Story modes. When you beat a given challenge, a predetermined set of machine parts will become available for purchase. You can decide which body, cockpit, and booster you want for your craft but that\\'s it for the hard tangibles. Any combination of colors can be selected for your craft, as well as a selection of ready-made decals. You can further customize your machine with your very own decals if you want to make some with the game\\'s included decal editor depending on your level of interest. Unfortunately, I\\'ve made several cars that look really, really cool, but I\\'ve yet to craft one that is competetive in the Standard or Expert modes. In fact, even most of the unlockable machines piloted by rival racers are pretty much unmanagable on the track. Even still, the customization process itself is pretty fun, as futuristic hovercraft aren\\'t exactly run-of-the-mill automobiles to most of us. If you don\\'t care to build your own machine from scratch, you can choose any one of the other machines from the other racers you\\'ve purchased with your tickets as a starting point, although cosmetic changes are the extent of that option. Finally, by playing F-Zero AX at the arcades with your memory card inserted into the machine will make new machines and pilots available as well as letting you race with your own custom machine at the arcade, but the apparent extinction of arcades greatly affects the likelihood that you\\'ll ever get to enjoy this nifty feature even once, let alone enough times to unlock everything.  GX runs like a lightning bolt and the frame rate never appears to skip a beat. If it did, you probably wouldn\\'t notice anyway. The graphics are usually abstract, but are mostly beautiful, often hypnotic, and always endearing to the futuristic theme. The fact that each racer has his/her own appearance, and every craft on the track is unique in appearance only adds to the quality of the graphics. Track designs look like they came from the mind of insane scientists which is great because, while intimidating with loops, twists, half-pipes, hundred-foot drop offs, and upside-down portions of track they\\'re well-crafted and loads of fun to race. The only graphical messiness to be seen is at the end of a victorious circuit during your \"interview\" with some obscure media personality. The characters don\\'t look bad, but they\\'re not altogether brilliant either. Brightly colored and animated, they are nice, but still don\\'t match the visual awesomeness found in the core gameplay screens.  Sound basically serves its purpose well too. All the machines\\' engines have an identical high-pitched whistle to them, with an explosive blast accenting takeoff from the starting line. Crashing into walls produces a grating sound that will really drive you to regain control of your steering, and the sudden whoosh from a booster on the road sounds nice as well. The small amount of voice acting in the game is surprisingly well done, even if the dialogue is laughable. Fast paced techno beats predictably comprise the game\\'s soundtrack, and are usually successful in building up excitement, but are too often repetetive. The frenzy of the gameplay usually subdues an otherwise mediocre musical score, so there\\'s no reason to bemoan it too severely.',\n",

Some of it works really well, and some of it not so well, but what we wind up with still remains an intense, blazingly fast and perfectly controlling racer, one that you shouldn't miss.The biggest change introduced in Burnout Paradise is the move to an open world, the streets of Paradise City (cue Guns 'N' Roses title track). The entire city is open at the start of the game, with the idea being that you can do whatever you want, whenever you want. Not all of the events are present at the start, mind you, and you'll have to put in a lot of time to unlock the game's roughly 75 cars, but you're never limited in the options before you. There are bits of good and bad to this. The good is that the city design is great, offering up plenty of varying spots for you to race in and tons of hidden areas to find. There is no shortage of tucked away passages, underground runs and all sorts of cool spots to hit. You'll find jumps littered everywhere, including small ramps with kickers on the side to send you into a barrel roll, which are great for the Stunt runs (which we'll come back to in a bit). The main downtown area of Paradise City is very reminiscent of the downtown tracks in the last couple games, while the western section of the city harkens back to the long, winding, countryside courses of past games as well. A couple of highways will put you dead in the middle of traffic and give you plenty of road to get up to speed on. Overall a great game.   \",\n",

       "  'description': 'Battlefield: Bad Company looked like your average shooter when it was first announced but attention was quickly increased when D.I.C.E. said that the environments in Bad Company where 90% destructible, and after numerous delays and a month of fragging in a demo, Bad Company is finally here.  Battlefield: Bad Company is a first time for the Battlefield series in many ways, A) It’s the first Battlefield game that isn’t a spin-off of the PC version of the franchise, B) Battlefield Bad Company is the first Battlefield game with a fleshed out campaign, and C) It features destruction like we have never seen and revolutionizes the way we play shooters. You start out the game as Preston Marlow, a troop who was transferred to B-Company nicknamed Bad-Company due to the high mortality rate of its soldiers. You join a squad with Sweetwater, Haggard, and Sarge. All of whom you will instantly attach yourselves to as they have very distinctive personalities. There are three difficulties to choose from including Easy, , and Hard. My first problem with the game is the achievements don’t stack so if you beat the game on Hard, you have to re-beat the game on  to get all the achievements for level completion. But this is easily over-looked as you are going to want to play the campaign over again to find all the collectables and gold in the levels. One thing with the story that might throw people off is the fact that the story and characters are humorous, even some of the big plot twists done in the flavor of humor which is honestly a good thing. I’m a little sick of the entire “Humanities last hope, blah, blah, blah.” story setting. Much like Halo 3’s single-player, intense firefights are broken up between driving sessions which are done very well. One other thing to be noted here is this game contains 0% frustration as when you die, it reloads you from your last checkpoint, but all the enemies you killed remain dead so it really helps keep the game moving and taking some of the trial an error part out of the game. Unlike Call of Duty 4, Gears of War, and Halo 3; Bad Company doesn’t use the rechargeable health system. Instead you get an “Auto-Injector” which restores your health instantly to 100% but it needs to recharge so it does add a little bit of strategy to the health about carefully planning on when to use it, however it does recharge rather quickly and sometimes you feel as if you constantly need to use it. Some of the enemy A.I. seems intelligent while some seem incredibly stupid however this is very minor as for what they lack in brain power they make up for shear numbers and firepower. The single player should take you about 10-15 hours depending on the difficulty and at the very least offers a good way to get introduced to the multiplayer however, if you can get passed the fact that this isn’t meant to have an ultra serious setting and story, you’re going to find a great experience offline. Next inline is the multiplayer in which the series just shines and this is no exception. There currently is only one game mode “Gold Rush” which is Search and Destroy on steroids. The attackers start out at a base and have ticket respawn meter so the team can only respawn so many times before they run out and the Defenders win. Defenders on the other hand start out at a different base and have two gold crates to defend. If attackers blow up the crates, they take the base and the defenders are forced to fall back and every time they do, it gets easier and easier to defend the crates. Defenders can spawn an infinite number of times. This new game type focuses on two bases at once which keeps the action moving forward and fast pace that it some times this game is a borderline twitch shooter. There are eight maps to play all excellently designed, with numerous vehicles that are placed in all the right places. One of the greatest things about the multiplayer is the balance of the weapons. Things like grenade spamming, dolphin diving, spawn killing are a thing of the past in this game (with the exception of the occasional spawn kill) splash damage from rocket launchers and grenades have been reduced to prevent abuse and players can no longer go prone, and there is no one weapon to rule them all. For instance take the M4A16 and the M16A3 if two players ten feet apart from each other stood perfectly still and each player aimed at the chest and started firing at the same time either bother players would die, or one would walk away on the verge of death. There are five classes to choose from Assault, Demolition, Recon, Specialist, and Support. All have very distinctive features and take experience to master. To unlock more weapons you have to rank up and there are 25 ranks total. Another cool aspect of the game is when you knife someone; you take their dog tag and start a collection of all the ones you’ve taken. Dog tags with images on them also represent trophies which you get for performing certain things like “In a round: six kills with the shotgun” ect. Spawning is the same as it always been except in Gold Rush you can only spawn in two places 1) your base (the safest with all the vehicles) or 2) with your squad (quickest way to the action, unsafe). You are randomly set into a squad with three other people and unfortunately they’re the only people you can talk to which puts a bit of a hamper on the game as Battlefield is largely a team based game so not being able to communicate when you need health or repairs complicates thing, but to help out icons are placed on your map that represent a person who needs health or a person a support person and the same thing is done with repairs. Almost forgot to mention you can take photos, but it doesn’t work the best as its ingame so catching that weird death position via theater mode in Halo 3 isn’t going to happen but it still is a nice feature. The destruction does a nice job of thinking that wall is crumbling into pieces at you blow it out with your grenade launcher. By the end of the game the maps never look the same as walls and buildings are just destroyed. This makes it even harder, or in some cases easier to defend the gold crates. While Bad Company isn’t a realistic game by any means the destruction sure helps you feel as if you were in a warzone. Couple that with some of the best sound effects I’ve ever heard in this game (it’s a crime not to play this game in 5.1 surround sound, it will blow your ear drums out.) and the graphics are great, but they do have the infamous “movie grain” effect from Mass Effect except there isn’t an option to turn it off so if your not playing this game in High Definition, textures are going look especially bad. The frame rate should be noted as it holds up amazing for a game with walls and trees and everything else blowing up on large maps every other second with twenty-four players in a match (sorry I forgot to mention that earlier). In the end Bad Company delivers a shooter experience like no other and you will play this game well up until November 7, which lets face, just about every other game is going to be empty that day but once Xbox Live slowly de-saturates from Gears of War you will still be playing this, and Bad Company if more maps come in the form of free DLC will last until D.I.C.E. decides to make another one.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Titan Quest begins with a familiar formula and progressively introduces a couple of interesting methods of playing the same adventure hack & slash in a way that is comfortable but interesting.\\xa0 If you\\'ve played entries in the Diablo series, you will immediately feel at home in Titan Quest.  This is not a bad thing, as Titan Quest does try to introduce some welcome game mechanics, such as the Mastery system, which allows you to travel up to two of eight different paths, creating 28 possible character \"class\" combinations.  You begin the game with a rather blank and boring character; you simply name a male or female character model--you will find no appearance customization options, and you will not choose your class during creation. How you set your character apart from everyone else will be determined by the choices you make while spending your skill points in the Mastery system as you progress, and how you choose to strengthen the 3.2 attribute scores that comprise your character\\'s strengths and weaknesses. These scores are the 3 primary, Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and the 2 secondary Health and Mana.  The game varies in difficulty, within context of the available difficulty modes, from 1-hit hack & slash kills, to gruesome boss fights that will force you to run and regroup.\\xa0 Much like Diablo 2, you can introduce your character to increased difficulty modes to offer greater challenge and reward on subsequent times through the campaign.  Making your way through Titan Quest can go as slowly or as quickly as you\\'d like: you can set the pace. If you like to explore every corner of the world, there are secondary quests and non-essential lore in place for you. Conversely, if you like to fly straight from objective to objective, following the main story, the path is often clear, even despite the droves of monsters blocking it.\\xa0 While additional side quests and lore may satisfy some, it ultimately won\\'t offer enough depth for fans of deep storyline RPGs such as Baldur\\'s Gate or Planescape: Torment.  The multiplayer is seamless with up to 6 players--much like Diablo, the difficulty scales with each additional person. There are group-specific skills that allow you to bestow buffs, auras, or enchantments upon your friends and allies. The only notable thing missing from multiplayer is any form of player vs. player (PvP) combat, short of a special mode that must be engaged using a command line switch when the game is started--requiring each player to do the same--but is mostly unsupported and simply not very interesting.  Another notable feature missing from Titan Quest that made Diablo so interesting is the terrain/environment randomization, which Titan Quest lacks. Re-playability may become a little stale as you progress through the same areas time after time, but the game makes up for it by offering three difficulty modes that are only available by completing the previous--the drive here is finding those \"ultra rare--rarer than rare\" legendary (purple) items.  The bottom line: if you enjoyed games like Diablo, Sacred--maybe even Divine Divinity--and you\\'re not tired of the genre, you will most undoubtedly enjoy a few times through Titan Quest to whet your appetite until the release of Diablo 3.',\n",

       " {'deck': 'dogsounds reviews: Call Of Duty 3',\n",
       "  'description': 'Originally written shortly after game launch.M1 Garand. Mention this weapon to any afficionado of WWII shooters, and in the eyes of most you will see a misty longing.For me, it is my favourite video-game weapon of all time, and in Call of Duty 3, I found the best recreation of it. Ever. End of. The sound, the 8-round clip, the fact that it totally pwns the bolt-action Kar98k in close-quarters combat. There is no more to say. And this is just one of the many things that Call of Duty 3 does just right.There are so many WWII games out there that it would be reasonable to assume that it has all been done, and there is nothing left to see here, move on. And that would be understandable. When Medal of Honor: Allied Assault was released, it was hailed as the most intense, realistic recreation of WWII combat that you could ever get. And in many ways, since those early days when players gasped in awe and sweated like nervous boyfriends in a lingerie department, nothing has come close to that effect. The Omaha beach landing sequence in that game was so unlike anything we had played before, it almost seemed wrong to use the word \"game\" or \"played\", as we were following in the footseps of real soldiers who gave their lives on those shores (see my blog \"Why do you play\" for more on this). And that game set a very high benchmark. If future games wanted to create the realism or grit, tension and terror of combat, they would have to work pretty damn hard. And, really, despite gameplay innovations and graphical enhancements since those days, nothing really ever has. Sure, there have been really great WWII shooters - Wolfenstein, Frontline, and more - and really poor ones. The closest we ever got was perhjaps Brothers in Arms - but even then, the emphasis was so heavy on the tactical side of battle that the emotion was never really present. But without waving a pointy finger in any particular direction, none has ever come close to imbuing the feeling of shock and respect that that beach landing sequence did.And, this may surprise you, neither does Call of Duty 3. it get close, but what it does do, very well, is go some way to showing the chaos of battle. One-man army is not the order of the day here, and as with the earlier incarnations of the Call of Duty franchise, the emphasis is on numbers - many combatants, all fighting and struggling by your side or against you. You are never really by yourself, although you can wander away from the pack and forge your own path - albeit temporarily. As is the tradition with the fanchise, the single player campaign is split into sections that allow you to play as different nationalities - a wonderful touch. You play as British, American Polish and Candian soldiers. Each different protagonist takes a path toward the same objective - the closing of the Falaise Gap to route entrenched German troops during the Normandy Breakout campaign. Unlike other Call of Duty games, though, the layout of the chapters is somewhat mixed up, so you don\\'t simply play a chapter as a Brit, a chapter as a Pole, and so on. They are nicely interleaved, with some corssover. At one point, you play a Canadian radio man working with Polish tankers defending their ground against a German counter-attack. it all fits together remarkably well, although the jumping around does leave you a little detached from the characters you play. The locales within the campaign vary, although they are all set within the rural French landscape. From farmhouses, open fields, fuel depots and the battered streets of French towns, all the settings are beautifully rendered and really do have a certain realism that screams \"next gen\". When Halo was first released back in 2001, many reviewers were heard to utter the phrase \"Look at the grass. OMG, look. At. The. Grass.\" Well, the same can be said here. Not only is grass rendered blade-by-blade, and animated, it is interactive. Walk over a patch of long grass, and you see flattened leaves in your wake. This is an incredibly nice touch, and is made even better when you suddenly realise that there is flattened grass just ahead of you, where you haven\\'t been yet. It has been crushed by the German troops hiding just around the corner. This has to be the first time grass has been useful as a tactical aid in a videogame. Overall, graphical presentation can only be described as awesome, and a step ahead of Call of Duty 2 - which was pretty damn impressive in its own right.Another nice touch, on the gameplay side, is the introduction of what can only be described as \"mini-games\". Instead of being prompted to press \"X\" to carry out an action, such as planting a charge on a Flak 88, now you are given a number of button and stick controls .One button plants the charge, then rotation of the thumbstick screws the detonator into the charge. Not terribly complicated, almost unneccessary, but it immerses you just that little extra bit. These do not happen all that often, however.The campaign is nicely varied, with missions ranging from simpl assault or defence to assisting the French Resistance rescue of comrades held captive by the Germans. There is nothing terribly innovative about the mission structures, but they fill the role admirably, and you will have a blast playing through the campaign. Added to this better vehicle control than in previous incarnations - in one instance, you man the guns in an SAS Willy\\'s jeep - you have got some cracking fun to be had. In another, you control the Jeep itself, and though it is no Warthog ride, the unique control scheme is simple and straightforward. There is even an achievement to be had for \"catching air\" (taking a big jump in a vehicle). When playing as the Polish tanker, the ubiquitous tank driving sections make a return, with (thankfully) a slightly more logical and simplifed control scheme than before, although they are still as unwelcome and tiresome.If you have played Call of Duty 3, you will not really find anything truly innovative or new in the game, but this is not neceesarily a bad point. Call of Duty 2 offered a fantastic campaign, and its sequel simply betters the formula with a few nice touches and much improved visuals. A little more of what you like don\\'t do no harm.As always, the sound in Call of Duty 3 is incredible. The sounds of carnage and war, the shouts of the combatants and the the environmental sounds of distant fighting all combine to make an incredibly stirring, compelling and loud aural backdrop. In surround, it is unbelieveable. Voice acting is excellent throughout, although the Axis voice actors seem to be the same as those on Call of Duty 2 (and one chap is even clearly recogniseable as one of the voice artists from Medal of Honor: Frontline!) , and their combat dialog is a little limited. You will hear the same phrases repeating throughout the campaign. A little more depth here would have added a little extra sparkle. There is a fair amount of context-sensitive speech - it is cool to hear a German soldier shout \"Amerikanischer Scharfschütze!\" when you take one of his comrades out with a headshot from a scoped Springfield, or \"Achtung! Maschinengewehr!\" as you spray entrenched enemies with a support weapon. But they lose their edge after a while, and more often than not they are lost in the cacophony. But that is a minor point. There are a few niggles to the gameplay. The touted feature before launch was the hand to hand combat feature - we saw the protagonist rounding a corner and being forced into close up combat with a German, both holding onto the German\\'s Kar98 riflle lengthways and fighting for control - a classic \"war film\" moment. The player is propmpted to press the triggers as fast as possible to simulate pushing the Germnan away before dispatching him with a a swift flick of the rifle butt. The first time you see this, it is awesome, and those players who have never seen or heard about it will be thrilled and amazed. You can tell how the struggle is going simply by the German\\'s face - his facial expressions are more panicked if you start to win, whereas if you are losing, he gets close to your face with a snarling sneer. The sequence itself is a heart-stopping moment, and incredible. Unfortunately, this only happens about five times in the whole campaign, and although you never actually expect it when it happens on first playthrough, the process itself dulls from the second time. It would have been nice so see a little more varied close up fighting - knife combat, for example, or unarmed combat akin to the fighting in Condemned: Criminal origins or Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay. Such features would not be out of place in a close-quarters setting, and would bring an extra dimesnion to the genre - face to face struggle, seeing the eyes of your victim. Sounds gruesome, but war is a horrible thing, and as with Medal of Honor, doing it in the right way can educate and excite at the same time. AI is generally good, although your comrades can sometimes get annoyingly stuck in a doorway that you need to go through. Animations are smooth, but, you know, since seeing the bonus footage animation reels on Medal of Honor: Frontline, I have never forgotten the solder skidding to a halt behind a corner, taking cover and popping a few shots off. I have always looked for those touches in games since then, and you very rarely get it. There are a few in Call of Duty 3, but much of the time the Axis troops will stay in place and shoot, or maybe run around a little bit, apart from in some setpiece charges.Where the campaign is good, the multiplayer is excellent. Although there are known issues around the way the multiplayer works - lengthy waits for ranked matches, games dropping out or freezing, and other technical quirks, I won\\'t focus on those. The gamplay is compelling and will keep you interested for a long time.There are a number of game modes, from Battle and Team Beattle (standard deathmatch) to variations on CTF and more. The multiplayer matches are class-oriented - you must select your role from the options available: Rifleman, Light Asault, Heavy Assault, Medic, Scout, Support and Anti-Armor. Each has different characteristics (defined by their weapons sets) and is able to perform a key role within a match - and the roles do crossover, allowing greater team flexibility.For example, if you need to take an enemy tank out, the Anti-Armor player is equipped with a Panzershreck or Bazooka (dependent on whether they are playing as Allies or Axis) and can do the job easily. However, Scouts and any classes equipped with hand grenades can also take out a tank - by mantling the back of it, which lets you plop a grenade right inside the cupola. Kaboom! Also, Heavy Assault classes are equipped with sticky grenades, which will adhere to vehcles (or personnel) and do the same job.Games are not played for kills alone - points are earned too, and it is not always the team with the highest kills that win a match. Each class has a special ability - Medics can revive fallen comrades, Scouts can call airstrikes, Support troops can drop ammunition for team members - and each time you use the abilty you earn points.Vehicles also play a big part in many of the maps. You can choose to man a Panzer or Sherman, an armed Horch or GM truck , or a motorbike and sidecar. All these vehicles can carry passengers - the tank, an extra gunner, the trucks, gunner and passenger, and the bike, a sidecar occupant. These often prove very useful and as in the campaign, control is intuitive and easy. Once gripe is that the truck gunner can easily kill his driver whilst shooting to the front of the vehicle, if team damage is on. This is a bit of a pain, since most drivers will drive you towards the enemy, and usually punish you for teamkilling. The maps themselves are as good looking as the campaign settings, and include woodland, a mountain prisoner of war camp, a fuel plant, a dam and a small French village. Each map lends itself to different tactics and gametypes, and are all designed to comfotably allow the maximum number of players - 24.The multiplayer is pretty similar to Call of Duty 2. Some maps allow more strategic, less fragfest play, and thankfully, unlike other games such as Halo 2 and Gears of War, annoying kiddies seem to be absent (for now). So, how did Treyarch do? All in all, very, very well. They stayed true to the formula, but added stunning visuals, great sound, and both a strong campaign and multiplayer element. There are niggles, as there are with any game, and perhaps some of the pre-release hype was not quite lived up to. These things aside though, Call of Duty 3 offers solid gameplay and a good level of replay value - especially if you ramp up the diffculty settings. And you will play online for a long time. All in all, an excellent game, and definitely a must-have for FPS or WWII game addicts.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Nintendo's epic 3D fighter series arrives on Wii as the best iteration yet. It's true -- there are a few minor quibbles to be made about the sometimes-repetitive single-player mode, unexplored third party character additions, lacking online communication options, or the largely familiar content inherent to sequels. But the moment you gather together with friends for a multiplayer match only to find, several minutes later, that you still haven't blinked, you'll have taken your first step into the digital drug that is Super Smash Bros. Brawl, and there's really no better way to describe it. The title's robust and balanced multiplayer offerings are completely engrossing and wholly entertaining from beginning to end, and this time around you can take those bouts to the online arena for similarly satisfying results. Masahiro Sakurai and his team at Sora have drowned the fighter in high-caliber presentational extras, from a superb soundtrack to gorgeous full-motion cut-scenes. These, coupled with all of the characters and stages to see and master, the many unlockable trophies and stickers, the stage builder, the screenshot and replay tools, and so much more, combine for an exceptionally deep experience overrun with replay value.  You will play the game to death when you get it. But unlike so many single-player hits, Metroid and Mario included, you will still be playing and consequently loving Brawl in the months and years to come. It is one of the great multiplayer titles of the generation and simply not to be missed.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'This game is like any FPS game. It is simple, to the point and nothing else really. You either love it or you don\\'t. Since this is a WW2 based game, many gamers who like this genre (since WWII is a genre in itself) is a must pick. Although this game is based of the Source Engine, it has it\\'s own problems, but good as well. Lets start with the ever popular \"scope-zoom effect\", when you hear about this you think, \"Hey, great it will be like every other FPS\".   Unfortunately, it isn\\'t \"all that and a bag of potato chips\", whenever you \"scope\" you are enticed with the wonderful animation of a man, bringing his weapon up and waiting to still bring it up, and still waiting, and it\\'s finally there. That is one main issue, that Valve seems to omit, from ever patching up, as they think it is not a big deal. Well, you\\'re wrong Valve, it is a problem, especially when your in a big firefight, and have a rifle, for example, a M1 Garand, and you want to scope in to blast away at the guy who is running across to reinforce his teammates, but you can\\'t because it is like you have arthritis. And as you wait for your animation to finish, he makes it and you get shot by the machine gunner or many other men, that don\\'t need to zoom in to kill you. Another problem with the game is the recoil. Whenever you try to shoot a Sub-Machine Gun or the BAR/MP 45 you get a massive recoil, of which you can barely keep straight. I had a hard time alone trying to push my mouse down while firing. And, yes I know it is trying to be authentic, but come on this is ridiculous, I don\\'t want to be firing burst shots every time I see an opposing player, I want to pump him full of lead. Sure recoiling is nice but Valve over does it, I mean firing full auto is completely pointless unless you are laying down, even while crouching it is pointless to fire; sure I want to be able to fire 10 bullets in a row, but not this way with my gun after 5 bullets staring at the sky, I\\'m pretty sure that soldiers in WWII could keep their gun straight after firing 10 rounds.   On a good note, the graphics are stunning, very realistic. As you fire you see a nice smoke cloud come up you can see and hear the bullets whizz by your head as your run for cover. As well, you can if you choose to run and gun, but it is best if you try to go slow, usually going out running into the open will get a sniper bullet in your head or your body looking like swiss cheese from the machine gunner over the hill or around the corner, so cover is your friend. There is some, not a lot, of strategy in how you advance, going out in the open as I said before to capture a flag will get you sniped or riddled full of bullets and you will ultimately be turned into swiss cheese.   I would recommend this game if you are a World War 2 shooter fan, and loved the originals such as Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, or any other WWII shooter such as the CoD franchise. This game although has many bugs and flaws, in the end turns out to be quite a good little shooter, although it is nothing more than multiplayer based game and does not offer you any type of single player. And after all the multiplayer will keep you busy for a quite a while.\\xa0 I give it a 4/5 stars. *EDITOR NOTE* - This review was written a couple of years ago, so some of the stuff I have written may not be up to par as my other reviews. Thanks ;D',\n",

       "  'description': 'BioShock is an amazing game that will not disappoint.If there was one game that really made me go \"Wow.\" it was BioShock. Once you\\'ve got this game installed and running, prepare for an amazing trip under the sea into this genre defining game. Now, would you kindly follow me into the rest of this review?Start to finish, BioShock has some of the best storytelling out there. The game starts you off in the middle of a plane crash, and even though you seemingly crashed in the middle of the ocean, an enormous spire is just a few yards away from where you land, and immediately you are greeted by a golden bust of Andrew Ryan, one of the game\\'s main antagonists and a banner declaring \"No Gods or Kings. Only Man.\" The art direction of this game is top notch. The world is so masterfully crafted that it will pull you in and won\\'t let you go until it is all over. And even though the game takes place in Rapture, a city utopia-turned-dystopia, the short breaks for ads whenever you obtain a new plasmid or the charm of the vending machines: their jingles echoing through the halls of the city under the sea that is Rapture.BioShock is a First Person Shooter with Role-Playing elements. You will collect Plasmids throughout your exploration of Rapture which are either special abilities like shooting lightning or telekinesis, all of which have their own unique look when you have them active, or passive abilities, like gaining health whenever you hit something with your wrench, or being able to resist damage. The system isn\\'t all that deep- it is mainly mix and match to your liking, so you won\\'t be bogged down or overwhelmed by the system. On the flipside, there are quite a few weapons in the game, all of which can be upgraded at the correct vending machine and have three different ammo types to pick from. And even the weapons illustrate the attention to detail, some of which look as though they were clearly built from the limited supplies the citizens of Rapture had. You\\'ll be able to get everything from a Magnum, to a Chemical Launcher (IE, Flamethrower) and much more. There is another \"weapon\" you will pick up, the camera, which allows you to photograph your enemies. Each photograph is rated and then raises your research against that particular foe, increasing your effectiveness against them or unlocking new plasmids for you to use.Going back to the visuals and sounds, Rapture looks and feels like a city that has gone to Hell. There are fragments of the world that once had been amongst the ruins, like a banner saying \"Happy New Year 1959!\" or the masks the various splicers, the insane inhabitants of Rapture that stalk the hallways, and some of the most powerful scenes for setting the mood and environment of the city come from the splicers themselves. In one early scene, you can notice the shadow of a splicer over a baby carriage singing a lullaby, a shadow of her former life, and it isn\\'t until after you dispatch the splicer that you realize there is nothing in the carriage itself. At the same time, Rapture is falling apart mechanically. Many times you are restoring systems or just in the wrong place at the wrong time, like when a tunnel partially shatters, and ocean water starts flooding in. Everything about the environment just keeps you in and makes everything just seem so alive.One complaint is that while the game touts multiple endings, they are two extremes and it is too easy to fall into one of the endings with only one action governing which you get. Throughout the game, morality steps in when you are confronted by the ever-present Big Daddies who are escorting ADAM (the \"currency\" used to buy plasmids) harvesters, the Little Sisters. Upon killing the Big Daddy, you are presented with the choice of either Harvesting all the ADAM the Little Sister has, or releasing her from her servitude to Rapture (yielding less ADAM upfront), returning her to her child-like innocence. In the end, the main bearing this choice has is on the ending: harvest at least one Little Sister and it is the \"bad\" ending for you, but if you don\\'t touch any of them and let them all go free, you get the \"good\" ending. Other than that, the main difference is if you choose the \"good\" path, the Little Sisters will reward you with gifts, effectively making up for the ADAM you don\\'t get by harvesting them and yielding a few extra plasmids as well. We can only hope BioShock 2 has a more fluid morality and ending system.If you like shooters or a good story, get BioShock. You won\\'t go wrong owning this game. It is quite possibly one of the best games released in recent years, and my only gripes are minimal. There is the deal where you can only activate your copy three times apparently, but that has yet to affect me, and I believe you can contact THQ to free up activations. So buyers beware, you may need an internet connection to activate this game prior to playing.',\n",

       "  'description': 'If I were to make a list of great things in this world…other than the obvious…Perez Hilton, milk chocolate, and Cody from Step by Step…Star Wars, legos, and video games would definitely be included on that list. Each one of those three things by themselves are amazing…but somewhere in this crazy world of ours some genius of a man said one day, “you know what would be the number 1 most uber awesomist thing in the entire history of the world to do?” To which his less inspired friend said “cure cancer, somehow end all war and suffering?” “No, that’s boring” laughed the genius man at his uncool buddy, “create a video game unlike none before it, a video game of epic proportions, a video game using legos from a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away….” And thus, Lego Star Wars: The Video Game, was born.Being a huge Star Wars fans since I first saw the trilogy played on TV when I was probably around 10 years old, I had to endure a great deal of despair when the new trilogy was released into theaters and was forced to watch all things I loved about the franchise flushed down the toilet by jar jar binks and hayden christensen….. But, the world works in mysterious and wonderful ways, and just when I thought all hope was lost, a little lego video game came along that restored my faith in humankind and love of all things Star Wars.All the classic villains and heroes have been transformed into lovable little lego people. Actually, pretty much everything from the movies has been constructed into lego blocks…vehicles, tables, walls, spaceships, flower pots, those adorable yet strangely creepy in a Gremlin-esque type of way ewoks, you name it…it’s now a lego. And the best part is that everything shatters into traditional lego components when hit with a blaster gun, lightsaber, or the force. The whole game pretty much revolves around manipulating the lego pieces around you as your characters move through the boards. Something blocking the way? Just blast it apart or use the force to move the blocks. Big hole in your path? Reform that wall over there into a bridge. Want revenge on those annoying little Jawas? Use the force-choke to break them into tiny lego pieces, steal their wallets, maybe buy some dinner and 3000 dollars worth of crack with their credit cards, and then go home to tend your piñata garden and continue to wait for that damn chippopotomas to come inside a (I spent a good hour and a half of my life making my garden 60% water for you dude, why do you effin have to tease me by arrogantly walking around the periph and never coming in to enjoy my garden awesomeness?!)…O wait, that’s a different game. Now you may be thinking…legos? What am I, six? Don’t let the idea of a video game based on a child’s toy deceive you, this game feels like Star Wars through and through. Depending on what of the two games you are playing (one game is based on the original trilogy, the other on the new trilogy) you either start in mos eisley cantina as R2D2 and threepio, or in dexters diner as young obi won and qui-gon jinn . Without spending the better part of my night explaining to you the whole gameplay, pretty much what you do is play through 6 important and memorable parts of each of the 6 episodes, collecting more characters, ships, and abilities to use along the way. For example, in the movies, luke skywalker is not introduced until Episode VI and thus you cannot use him in the game until you reach the specific level in that episode that corresponds to the part of the movie where he is introduced. And obbbbvvviously only jedis and some siths can use the force. Cmon, how retarded would that be to see Jar Jar running around using the force to make flowers grow and laughing annoyingly about how he ruined episode I…god I hate him.  Once you complete the game on story mode you can go back and play all the boards again with any character, even switching characters within each board at will. I’ll tell you, nothings sweeter than watching princess leia and darth maul kicking ass and taking names in the clone wars (fyi, this is extra cool because those characters were never alive at the same time period nor fought in the clone wars, duuuhhh). You can also go back and work on the extra missions, like collecting what are called mini kits which build new ships and vehicles, working for jabba the hut as a bounty hunter, and unlocking secret new rooms that for some reason usually involve stormtroppers, speedos, and hot tubs….no lie. Another cool aspect about this game…you can’t lose. Literally, there is no game over. If you die you simply just break into lego bits, loose some lego money, and regenerate. So pretty much you can play for hours and hours and never have to worry about starting over due to accidentally falling out of the window of the millennium falcon after a rowdy game of “guess what, we’re related!” Even if your name is Sucky Suckface McSucksalot from Suckstawaga, there is no way you can really loose at this game. The two player mode can be a small bit annoying due to the fact that there are no split screens so both players have to both have the same idea on what direction you want to go and what you want to do (to note, don’t ever play this game with TommyB or you will want to punch yourself in the eye with frustration). But whenever the second player wants to drop out and go smoke that crack he bought earlier, the game doesn’t skip a beat; you can continue on playing like there’s no tomorrow. What’s more is that there are hilarious little lego movie clips between game play of the lego characters parodying various key parts of all the movies.Sadly I have played almost twice through both of the games and even the recently released Complete Saga edition (all 6 episodes in one game). Don’t fret though, in May or June Lego Indiana Jones will be released and sometime possibly next year we get Lego Batman. Neither of which will be nearly as wonderfully amazing as the Star Wars games, but, I’m pretty sure making anything into cartoon lego characters automatically puts it on the list of coolest games ever. Now I can only dream for Lego Lord of the Rings, or Lego Back to the Future…. And those of you who have never seen a Star Wars movie….I don’t even know how you can look at yourself in the mirror without doubling over in a sobbing fit of regret over how you wasted your life…you sicken me. There’s nothing for you here. Just leave. These are not the droids you are looking for….Alli S.found at bizzlebros.wordpress.com',\n",

       "  'description': 'Gears of War is one of the latest shooters on the 360 and you play as Marcus Fenix, an ex soldier who was sent to prison because he refused orders when earth was getting attacked; to save his dad! Only to find out his dad already died. 14 years and earth is in war with the locust, a group of monsters previously referred to the boogey man. Dom, a delta squad soldier who breaks into prison and frees Fenix. With the help of Fenix they set to stop the war on earth. The gameplay in gears of war is basically take cover, shoot, frag them together and melee them when they charge at you. This feels fucking sweet!! The main focus is covering, everywhere there\\'s somewhere you can take cover and kill people. You just go near the object, wall, fort etc and take cover. Shoot, cover shoot. It\\'s the greatest experience in gaming ever. After a few hours you\\'ll star covering when you\\'re playing football and then when they get a point they\\'ll go to you: WTF? That\\'s how it is. You can sprint in the game by holding down A. Also if you press L then you can aim. You can blind shoot too. The health system in Gears of War is similar to Halo 2, you recover after a period of time. Basically a Massive Gear piece will come to the screen first as a fade then when it\\'s becoming clearer you\\'re in danger! Simply cover and after a few seconds will heal. Brilliant! Beats looking for health packs for an hour! The sound in Gears of War sounds fucking amazing! You can hear them screaming for their lives as you kill them and the music is OMG SRYSLY?! Yeah that good. It also alerts you if you have enemies to kill making the game suspense and helping. You have many guns in the game from the sniper gun to the chainsawattachedrifle. The chainsaw gun in the game is an A-K 47 with a chainsaw on the top of it. The chainsaw acts as a melee weapon. And trust me it\\'s the best thing ever; all the blood goes onto the screen! You\\'ll need time to be a master it. You also get this arrow gun which when you shoot someone they explode, regardless of who they are, unless they\\'re a boss. It can carry a few ammo at a time, same with the rocket launcher. The sniping in this game is so easy that you\\'d thing you\\'re a pro when you first use it. No more online snipers you can be a newbie and be a \"sniper\" it\\'s that easy. The pistol is good for shooting mini monsters and close enemies. The graphics in the game a **** awesome!! They look real, they\\'re the best ever. You\\'d be amazed at the graphics and gore levels. You do get to drive a vehicle and it\\'s crap! One of the worst missions ever. It\\'s slow and you can only have one person doing everything. When you shoot something they all die. There are two bosses in this game and yes you guessed it one of them is the giant spider, I\\'m not telling which one though. This said Gears of War is a short game, maybe a little longer than Halo 2 but still. It only has 5 acts. But you\\'ll play this more and more and more!!!',\n",

       "  'description': \" With its solid story line good and the excellent game play will make you feel as though you have stepped into your characters shoes this game is a must buy for anyone looking for a solid FPS. The game's scope is huge and in certain set pieces you can see hundreds of enemies and allies battle it out in huge detailed environments. It also offers tonnes of weaponry and grenades and the action will keep you on your toes. The A.I. especially in the harder difficulties is a lot of fun to play it and will push your skills to the maximum. RFOM strikes a delicate balance between challenging and impossible that very few games nail. In fact you can argue that the A.I. enemy on harder difficulties in RFOM is even better than the likes of COD4 and Halo3. The graphics are not going to blow away anybody but everything is modeled very well and the characters look alive and real.  RFOM's multilayer is a great asset as it will have you coming back long after you have finished with the single player. The sheer number of people will amaze you and there are no visible glitches or lag even with all these people playing. RFOM is a solid experience overall that everyone should enjoy. \",\n",

       "  'description': 'Originally written just after launchThere\\'s probably very little to write in this review that hasn\\'t already been said a million times before. There have been a lot of promises made about the \\'next generation\\' of gaming, and in a lot of cases, across all platforms, these have yet to materialize. But in Epic\\'s outstanding \"Gears of War\", we see the first real taste of what \\'next-gen\\' really means. Now, it is important to note here that the glimpse of \\'next-gen\\' afforded by this game really only relates to visuals. It is not inconceivable that this game could have been released on the last-gen Xbox, with the only major difference being the graphics and perhaps some of the size of the maps reduced. In terms of gameplay, nothing much offered by this game would have been impossible. Games like BLACK showed just how much of the Xbox\\'s potential lay untapped for so much of it\\'s five-year lifespan.But that is not to detract from the game\\'s worth. Aside from what you look at, the gameplay is such that you find yourself drawn in completely, and there is very little within the game that you can actually point at and say \"that sucks\". So, to the game. Much has been said of the game\\'s story - or lack of. Although the story and characterisation in the game are not of the same depth and quality of something like, say, Halo, we are not talking irrelevant uncoordinated nonsense such as you would find in Lost Planet. What there is fits together fairly well and serves the purpose of the game nicely. However, although on first playthrough there seems little story apparent, the more you play it, the more you see little details that suggest a more considered and thoughtful plot. Admittedly, there is not that much revealed in-game - for example, Imulsion and its importance are not discussed greatly in the game context - but if you look hard enough around the game and the web, you can find it.The game takes place on the planet Sera, a world colonised by humans. Life on Sera was pretty good, and judging by the scenery you see in-game, peaceful, democratic and artistic. This all changed with the discovery of Imulsion, a natural substance that cold be harnessed as a remarkably efficient fuel in such a way that all the planet\\'s energy needs would be met. Sadly, those territories that had access to the natural reserves of Imusion were viewed jealously by those that did not, and conflict inevitably ensued. This conflict continued - by way of an allegory of modern-day oil-fuelled confrontations - until Emergence Day.On that fateful day, the Locust Horde, a subterranean population of aggressive, warrior-like \"ugly alien dudes\" gathered under every major city on Sera, surfaced, and laid waste to anything they could find. Traditionally seen as myth or Boogeyman, the Horde were more powerful than had ever been previously assumed. It is assumed that the Horde are angered at the humans\\' mining of Imulsion and encroachment into their domain (although their true motivations are never explained). Previously warring factions came together as the Coalition of Ordered Governments, and now faced with little option and overwhelmed by a seemingly superior enemy, the COG have little choice but to cut their losses and instigate a \\'scorched earth\\' policy - destroy their own cities and territories with weapons of mass destruction and orbital beam weapons, to prevent the Horde from capturing them. The survivors of this policy gathered in the one remaining safe harbor - Jacinto Plateau - an area of granite impenetrable to the Locust. However, now the Locust are upon the Plateau, and nowhere is safe any longer.You start the game in Jacinto Maximum Security Penitentiary, and you are Marcus Fenix, A Gear (soldier of the COG) jailed for 40 years for dereliction of duty because you abandoned your post to save your father. Things are going badly now, and the COG has deemed that with numbers dwindling, all able bodied souls - jailed or not - should take up arms against the Horde. You are busted out of jail by your comrade in arms Dominic Santiago, and here the adventure begins.Now, I feel I should discuss the gameplay first here. Like I suggested earlier, nothing in the gameplay is specifically new or \\'next-gen\\'. Simply, you run through the levels moving from objective to objective, taking out alien dudes along the way. But what makes this game stand out and so enjoyable is the way the gameplay is implemented. Rather than a simple, tried and tested run-and-gun approach, Gears makes you use cover - all the time. Anything from concrete blocks, to cars and buildings can be used, and the mechanic is simple, intuitive and effective. Now, it is nothing new - games like kill.switch and Rainbow Six have used cover, but in Gears I feel you see the most effective use of a cover system yet. Had this been an FPS, it would not have worked, but as the game is played frm a third-person perspective, it works perfectly. And it takes all of ten seconds to learn, which is good, because if you don\\'t use it, you are toast. Every time.And the selection of weapons adds to the \\'work for your money\\' ethic of the gameplay. Although they are nicely varied, if I am honest, there are only a small handful of weapons that you really need. The default Lancer assault rifle is usually your start weapon, and in most cases takes care of most enemies. And it also has the added bonus of having a chainsaw bayonet - a chainsaw! One of the most satisying things about Gears is the chainsaw attack - approach an unsupecting enemy and fire that sucker up. As your blade cuts through the poor unfortunate, blood and gore fly every which way - and even onto the camera, leaving blood spatters across your screen. It is one of the most satisying ways to take out an enemy I have ever come across, and because there is an inherent risk in doing it - you open yourself up to fire or melee attacks from the enemy - you feel a certain sense of achievement when you do it successfully.Other weapons include the Locust equivalent of the Lancer, which does not have a chainsaw attachment, but does have a little more stopping power. However, like Halo 2\\'s Battle Rifle, it fires in three-round bursts, which can be a pain when you are simply trying to put as much lead in an enemy in as short a time as possible. There is also a human Sniper Rifle, which is a bolt-action weapon, but offers one-shot kills. Grenades are interesting - rather than the standard fare, these are bolo grenades - the grenade is on the end of a chain, so rather than simply throwing them you have to wind up and hurl them like a slingshot. However, although you are given a handy aiming reticle to see exactly where they should land, more often than not the camera angle is such that you can\\'t tell where this will be - so although they are useful, they are not perfect, and often there is a fair bit of luck involved in using them successfully. There are other weapons in the game, such as the Boomshot rocket launcher used by Locust Boomers, or the Torque Bow used by the Theron Guards - a sort of crossbow- energy-exploding-projectile-weapon - and a standard pistol. But as with most games you\\'ll tend to find which work best for you and stick to those. I have to admit that despite everyone raving about the Torque Bow, I have never got the hang of it, and avoid it. I would much rather have the sniper, truth be told.The one truly unique aspect present in Gears, and related to weapons, is the Active Reload on all weapons. In an interesting twist, Epic thought it would be an idea to take the usually simple act of reloading and make it into a mini-game in its own right. Basically, below every weapon on the HUD is a small bar, in the middle of which is a white hotspot. Simply put, when you hit the right bumper to reload, a line whizzes across it. If you hit the bumper again at exactly the right time and get the bar in the hotspot, you are rewarded with a quicker reload and a little more stopping power for a short time. Stop the line just outside the hotspot in the gray area, and you simply get a quicker reload. Miss the hotspot and the outer gray area altogether, and your weapon jams - giving you a longer reload, and usually eliciting profanities from Marcus. It sounds fiddly, but once you have done it a few times it becomes instinctive, and fun, and it even garners achievement points if you are particularly proficient. Enemy AI is great, and one thing to realise is that the Locust are just as keyed up about the cover system as you are. They will use it, and they will also take advantage of destructible objects that you may be hiding behind - by trying to destroy them. They will also flank you, given half the chance, whilst you are enagaged fighting others. You will fight against a number of different Locust troops, all big, ugly and hard as nails. The enemies are nicely balanced, stepping up in diffculty levels, from the basic grunts to the tougher Theron Guards, all the way to the awesome and totally pant-wettingly sweat-inducing Beserker - a blind, female behemoth who tracks you by sound, and whose method of attack is simply running into you like a Mack truck and smearing you across whatever surface is nearest - as well as taking out most of the scenery at the same time. She is that hard.The AI of your teammates is also impressive for the most part, and banter amongst them is often funny and satisfying. The team all counterpoint each other, and\\xa0bitch equally, like an old married couple - if a couple involved five people. You play as Delta Squad, which includes Fenix, Dominic, Baird and Carmine. You also pick up a member of Alpha Squad - Augustus \"The Cole Train\" Cole. One can only assume that Carmine is not quite the hard man of the team, as he keeps his helmet firmly on, whilst everyone else is obviously crazy enough to run around with heads fully exposed. The team dynamic is very good, and although the script could have used a little extra depth and complexity, it serves its purpose well, and keeps you entertained.Missions within the game are nicely varied, although there is only so much variation to be had given the basic \\'shoot ugly subterranean alien dudes\\' premise. At its heart Gears is an action game, not a thinker, so there should be no expectations of complex logistics or missions here.A fantastic touch is added about a third of the way in as night begins to fall, and you get to deal with the complex little buggers that are the Krill. These flying devils (lifted straight out of Pitch Black, it has to be said) will add an extra dimension to your gameplay. They shun the light, and are creatures of the dark, atttacking anything stupid enough to enter the shadows swiftly and mercilessly, like flying pihranas. As you progress through the streets at night you are forced to plan your movements according to where the light and dark areas are, and often you are required to improvise light sources to open up a path that would otherwise be a pretty certain journey to join the choir invisble. On paper, this sounds like an idea that would definitely turn off the fun-tap, but in practice Epic have incorporated it perfectly.Audio is excellent. From weapons fire to voice talent, from ambient environmental sounds to the ever-present screeching of the Krill during the night-time chapters, everything works together to give a satisfying aural backdrop. My only one quibble would be the seeming lack of any helicopter noise when the level Campus Grinder starts - you hear bullets whizzing off the metal plate, but the helicopter itself makes no noise. Oops!Thankfully, Epic chose a \"less is more\" approach to the soundtrack, and you have to give them credit for this. What music their is is good, solid stuff, and fits very well with the bravado and action-hero machismo of the protagonists.Now, finally, I turn to the visuals. Do I really need to say anything? Epic have given us what is most likely the best-looking game on the 360 to date, and although they will no doubt be surpassed by future games as the lifecycle of the console moves along, they certainly set a very high bar for which other developers must now surely aim.Lighting and colors are incredible. The default color scheme has a washed out, Band of Brothers feel to it. Epic obviously realised that not all gamers would appreciate this, and that some would want some kick-ass colors to show off their new console and big-ass hi-def screens, so they included options to change the coloration to more intense levels. The design of the surface levels suggest perfectly the destruction and desolation left behind on Sera, but also, in a subtle way, they also create a feel for Sera that is very interesting - one of a lost, great civilisation of artists and thinkers. These are not just futuristic city streets laid to waste. In fact, there is almost nothing here that wold be out of place in eighteenth century Paris or Vienna. Instead we see great stone buildings, museums, galleries, conservatories. It is like looking at the ruins of ancient Greece or Rome, some lost city of noble thinkers and artisans. It is very effectively carried out, and a line on the rear of the game box further reinforces this: \"Cties crumbling, Man\\'s greatest works fallen\". A very odd statement to make, unless you think that designers had a very specific Utopia in mind for Sera, which I think they have created, marvellously.Characters are brilliantly executed. The Gears are big, thick dudes, with huge armor, thick necks, and suitably gruff expressions on their faces. Locust models are lumpy, alien, grubby and altogether repusive and look like they smell real bad. Everyone, human and Locust, is big. And, rather bizarrely, sometimes characters have a strangely pleasing ambient inner glow about them, as if we are looking at some tiny creature in an electron microscope. Wierd, but nice.Cutscenes are brilliantly executed - take the cutscene where we first see General Raam - the composition and camerawork is perfect. There are a couple of areas that detract form the awesome images though, albeit minor. Epic have fallen foul of a familiar trick on the Xbox 360 that I have seen in other games such as Rainbow Six Vegas: when you are in the dark, it seems that instead of just being in the dark, they merely drop the color palette down to a \\'Windows Safe Mode\\' effect, where only a few dark tones can be seen. I can\\'t help thinking that this is a bit of a cheap, unsatisfying trick, given the amount of bang you get for your buck in other lighting conditions. Also, sometimes you can see that some grubby or matt textures are achieved by overlaying a transparent grainy map image on the object. Next time you get chance, go and look close up at the nose of a dead Seeder, and shift your view slightly over the leather-like armour on its head. You\\'ll see the texture map move independent of the actual creature\\'s head. Whilst this makes surfaces look fantastic from a distance, close up it is a bit dissapointing. Similarly, next time you are on the approach to the Imulsion mine, study closely the shimmering rainfall on pipes and silos. Here they seem to have used an \\'Amiga palette cycle\\' effect - again, great from a distance, but a bit poor close up. FInally, although the effort expended on the Gears and Locust characters is fantastic, I can\\'t help thinking that other characters in the game look a little poorly textured, often with low-res, blurry clothing and badly-animated body movements. Still, these are but small niggles, and do not detract from the gameplay.Now, this is the difficult bit. Multiplayer. I have tried it once, and I know some people think it rocks, but I can only say this - my experience? It sucked.I am used to Halo or Call of Duty. So after joining three games and defaulting to spectator mode right from the start, or starting a game, dying within 20 seconds and having to sit the rest of the game out in spectator mode? Not my bag. So I am afraid that is all I can offer on multiplayer.However...there is the option of online co-op play. And I have to say, this is the best example of online co-op I have ever seen. Ever. End of. I seriously, seriously hope that most of the major developers out there take note and start implementing online co-op as a STANDARD in their games. There is nothing so cool as playing co-op with a friend but keeping the whole screen to yourself (and with my 37\" LCD, that just rocks :) ) Drop-in, drop-out is seamless. One minute, Dominic Santiago is next to you. The next, it is your friend and you are chatting over Xbox live whilst you play. And the fact that on harder difficulty setting, co-op is kind of a must means that by the simple addition of online co-op, Epic have added a whole new level of replayabilty to the game, because it enables you to do stuff that, for most folks, would not be achievable. In most games, co-op just allows you to share an experience that you could do by yourself, but in Gears, completion of some tasks has the need for co-op built in. So, in conclusion, Gears Of War may only have two real, neat innovations - online co-op and Active Reload. And these aren\\'t particularly next-gen. But when you take the package as a whole, with the awesome audio, graphics, gameeplay and immersion, you are given as a whole something that you could not have hoped to experience on the last generation of consoles.And given that Xbox 360 games that we play in four, five years time will make games like Gears of War look like half-assed, easy rides for the systems\\' triple cores, you know what? I can\\'t wait. Bring it!',\n",

       "  'description': \"NBA 2K7 is a basketball game that came out a little after the other versions. It’s your typical basketball game; it has seasons and off season, mini games, licensed teams and perfects them. In the seasons you choose a team and you play through you can have your own developing team which your team will get better and better. It gets boring after a few months, that saying maybe about 20 hours, but that's the season mode which shows that you'll be entertained for a long time if you play by your self.  There is the basic season, if you can't be asked you can just select a team and play other teams. I may have put it to sound boring but its good fun too, not as challenging since you can just go and select a team like Miami Heat. That will keep you entertained too. To shoot in the game you use the analogue stick and just simply shoot. It's easier to slam dunk. You use the same button to steal the ball. You can do skills in the game by pressing R but remember not to do it for long. There is a new mode called street; which is OMG sweat. The graphics in the street mode will look HD even if you have a standard TV, because they focused the graphics on the players so it's easier. NBA is a graphically good game and the music is great fun. With other people you'll be entertained for a long time if not then you have to be a basketball fan to play it for long. I recommend you buy this on the other platforms; it's cheaper.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Shadow of The Colossus comes from the makers of ICO. It's said to be the next ICO but people think that its dark story is different from ICO. You play a heartbroken warrior, who takes a princess to the temple. The warrior asks the gods to bring back the princess. They tell him that he can, only is he could defeat the 16 colossi that rule the land. With his loyal steed, the warrior goes off to a journey to bring back his love and defeat the 16 mystical beasts.  The bosses in The Shadow of the Colossus are the biggest bosses ever in a video game. The only way to defeat them is to climb up onto their bodies and try to find their weak points. Usually people think that it would be a beat 'em up, surprisingly it isn’t! You have to climb onto the beast, it's like a puzzle. Once you've found their weak point, a few stabs and they're dead. The creators also said that some of the bosses may be mechanical or beast, but they want you to decide (They did this to stimulate your brain, In My Opinion that's kind of retarded).  The creators wanted to create a beautiful and visual world so that the players would be happy while playing the game. The world is massive and makes the world graphically superb. Somehow they managed to create a large world with excellent graphics. However there's a twist! The world is so big that you can get lost easily and there are LAG problems because of the graphics. You have your horse to ride around the area and there aren't people in the game so it does get lonely. The gameplay is okay but it's different. They changed the controls around. They made it unfamiliar to people who play these types of games which was a wrong move. They've also decided to add a grip meter, so when you climbing a colossi you could fall off if the meter runs out, another annoying move. You have three weapons your fist, sword and arrow that you change with the right d-pad. The sound is amazing. Overall Shadow of the Colossi is an amazing and beautiful game which is accepted from the makers of Ico.\",\n",

       "  'description': ' 25 years ago Mario was released. And for the past 25 years it has been the biggest gaming franchise ever! The game that sold millions was the original. Now he’s back. This time it’s the game that sold millions, updated. The New Super Mario is the first one but it’s updated, but could this Mario beat the original Mario?  Mario is the most recognised character in gaming history. He’s appeared in over hundred games; many of these games are best sellers from Super Mario to Mario 64. Mario first appeared in Donkey Kong, where he had to save a princess from the King Kong spoof Donkey Kong. Then he appeared in an arcade spoof-off Super Mario Bros. When the SNES came into our homes Super Mario was there, alone it sold 40 million copies and back then they were expensive. This means it’s the best selling game off all time. There was a problem all the new gamers couldn’t play it. So they re-created it onto the DS…  They still have the same cheats in the original and off course they’ve got the two player co-op which works pretty well. To add affect they made the characters look 3D, but it’s a side scrolling 2D game, so it’s 2.5D game. Basically Bowser’s son kidnaps Princess Peach, and takes her through seven worlds. You have to go through and defeat him once in the seven worlds; half way through you meet him. He runs off to a castle that’s always at the end of the world and in that castle Bowser is there, and you have to defeat him once in seven worlds. So 14 times you have to defeat the Bowser family. Sounds easy but the game is long and fun, also with all the extra bonuses you’ll be hooked.  The gameplay for the game is fast. It has the same  that the original has. It actually feels like you’re playing Mario 64, that sort off hype. It does get pretty annoying when you dash through the whole game. The thing that made Super Mario from being perfect was the enemy system. If you were in your normal form and you touch an enemy you’ll die which does get troublesome if you’re trying to get to the other side of the level. This is backed up by the half system. If you go half way through the game there’s a flag, so if you die and have enough lives to go back you’ll be there.   There is the original mushroom and the flower. Mushroom increasing your size and flower giving you fire power. First it’s the mushroom then the flower. If you get hit while you’ve got the flower you go to mushroom stage and if you get hit while you got the mushroom you’re in your normal stage. There are underwater levels as well. The music and sound for this game is perfect and it will keep you entertained for hours. If you’ve seen the screen shots then you’d have seen a giant Mario. This is the yellow mushroom; it automatically makes you big and indestructible. Over all New Super Mario Bros is probably the game of June and had sold 100 thousand copies in its first day.   ',\n",

First of all, I think the game was made way to challenging, and it could've had much simpler controls, and it could have had much more areas. Sure, there was plenty of levels in each area, but the areas were pretty small, and there wasn't much to discover in any of the areas. Now, this game is not bad. Trust me. It's quite good, it just needs work. Personally, I think you can get your money's worth out of just playing in the courtyard in front of the castle. Also, if we didn't have this game, we probably wouldn't have Galaxy, for if you study the gameplay of Mario 64 and Galaxy, the gameplay is very\\xa0similar. The story is pretty good, and the graphics are fine. The early areas in the game also have fairly exciting gameplay. Overall, Super Mario 64 is a great game, but no more than you can expect from a Mario game on the 64.\",\n",

There are many things wrong with this game; however there are many things good with this game. It's like a movie, a James Bond movie.   This game is in third person. I wanted a first person Bond game. You've got to do a series of missions, some are repeated again and again, some are bothering, and some are fun. At least they kept the driving the same. The driving is as good as ever, it doesn't mean it's good. It's troublesome to take a turn in the game, which you need to do.   They've added more stealth to the game, because it's third person. You can crouch down; go along the wall, the works. They didn't forget that handy gun that you can climb walls with. It's easier to climb down, just jump off. When you're trying to change weapons, it's really annoying. When you go to change it, the game goes in slow motion, which is annoying.   When you shoot someone on the head they don't die! You've got to shoot 50 weapons at once, they've should off changed this. The camera angles get in your way, and it's a slow game; you can't sprint. Pierce Bronson’s voice makes it feel like a bond game. This game, rather than the other, feels like a bond game. It's nothing compared to Goldeneye, then again, no shooting game is. Oh yeah, the multiplayer kicks ass!! \",\n",

You arrive at your destination, you're broke you need a house when suddenly a man gives you an offer. You can have a small house, and pay him back 18,000 bells when you have the money. That's all dandy, but then there's another alternative, you don't ever have to pay him back, you can live in your small house or pay him back and make your house bigger. Anyway you're here.  There are loads of thing you can do. From fossil collecting for the local museum or fish and give those to Tom nook for some cash, either way you have a few things to do. To move you use the stylus. In fact you don't need the top screen at all, only for Star-gazing or when there's something up there to shoot. So you only need your lucky stylus pen.   Animal Crossing is online, which is amazing. You can go to other people's houses and explore around. You can write down your mate's friend code and go to their town. To let people in you open your gates but be warned, strangers and lurkers can come in and chop down you trees, and you wouldn't want that would you?  You can play Animal Crossing for 6 hours a day or only 5 mins a day, but it will never lose its magic. It's quite easy and worth playing. It will take 10 mins to catch onto the controls.

But who knew that the DS' Metroid Prime (its Special shooter) would have Online Play! This Metroid game famous for: The best handheld shooter ever, one of the best games on the DS, its cut scene graphics are nearly 'real like', good controls and so on...   You take the role as Samus: a sexy, Bounty Hunter, who's a number one hunter. You've got to defeat each Bounty on each planet. But be careful, other Bounty Hunters might be after the same bounty! And you might have to fight them. You land on one planet and you've got to go and get the boss key. In each stage there's a mini boss, usually a Bounty. You've got to kill them to get their jewels. Sounds Evil but it's satisfying.   The controls are easy (Once you've gotten used to them). There's a Dual Mode and a Stylus mode. The Stylus mode is where you use the touch screen to turn around, morph into a ball and jump. And Dual is where you don't use the Touch screen, at all! There is right hand and left hand (Those with the demo should know). Right hand Stylus is where you move with the directions and use the touch screen to turn around and stuff. Right hand Dual mode is where you move with the D-Pad and turn around with the controls. Left Hand Stylus is where you move with the Controls and use the touch screen you turn. Left Hand Stylus is where you move with the controls and rotate with the D-Pad. So the controls are for everyone!  You've got a boss in each Planet. All of the bosses feel the same, like you're repeating the game. After each boss you've got to escape from the planet immediately (in a time limit) going to all the places that you've been through. You've got to do this all the time, yes all the time! It does get tedious and annoying. Sometimes there are Hunters trying to fight you! You've got to kill them to proceed out of the planet. Then you've got to go to you're ship. Jump on top and walk towards the door. It's hard, but it's satisfying. You can't save the game in the spot; you've got to go to your ship, which is all the way in the beginning. So you can only save after a planet. This really sucks if you're on the go.  The best part of the game is the online play! This makes the game stand out from the other Metroid games. If you're online you've got seven modes to play from. Bounty, Death Match, Survival, Defender, Prime Hunter, Capture the Flag and Onslaught. In Bounty you've got to find Octoliths and return them into the goal. And prevent others to do the same. Death match is where you've got to have the most kills to win. Survival is where you fight three other hunters and you've got three lives. Defender is when you've got to occupy a central ring and prevent others from going in. Prime Hunter is when there's a Prime Hunter and you've got to kill them to be a Prime Hunter. Be the Prime Hunter 'till the end of the match to win! Capture the Flag is where you've got to capture the other team's Octolith, it doesn't use flags. Onslaught is where you've got nodes and you've got to claim them. Make a line to the enemies Power Core and destroy it! Online you've got a variety of weapons and you can do Headshots, this is amazing. This game's a winner! You must buy this whoever you are...\",\n",

       "  'description': \"N+ is a suprisingly fun game thats easy to love and easy to hate becuase of its ocasionally frustrating difficultyGraphicsN+ features nice, simple graphics and everything is very easy to recognize. You will rarely ever die from confusion of where you are in single player thanks to the way that you character's black body stands out against the grey and white background.GameplayThe gameplay of N+ is similiar to a 2D platformer, your goal is to reach a switch that opens a door, and then get to that door so you can exit. As simple as this sounds, it can get extremely complicated, due to obstacles that try to prevent you from living. There are drones that shoots homing rockets, laser beams, rail guns,\\xa0land\\xa0mines on the ground,\\xa0and enemies that try to touch you to make you blow up, and when you die, the result is just plain hilarious. Your body will explode into several different parts. These parts will then blast away from where you died, and if they hit any other\\xa0enemy or mine, they get blasted into the air again, and you get to watch more hilarious carnage. However if you manage to make it past one of these\\xa0levels, you will procede to the next one until you've completed an episode, or five levels. At the time of writing, there are 50 singleplayer episodes in the game\\xa0which is plenty to keep you busy for many many hours, but packs of around 200 levels are being promised as free DLC for the future.Co-opN+ has some frickin awesome co-op. Recently i was at a rock band party with some friends, and we started looking through my hard drive. We found N+ and decided to give co-op a go. This was at 10pm, and 8 hours later, at 6am we had beaten all ten co-op episodes. To put it simply, the co-op of N+ is briliantly addictive. SoundThe sound, like the graphics, wont wow you, but it gets the job done with some pretty catchy tunesOverallIts a great purchase for only $10. With 250 single player levels, 50 coop levels, and fun gameplay, you cant go wrong, but people that arent very good at 2D platformers should try the demo first to see if they can handle this games occasional frustrating difficulty.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Grand Theft Auto \\xa0is back with its latest installment. You return to a new Liberty CIty as Niko Bellic, a russian who has come to America to start anew. When he arrives in the \"land of oppurtunity\" he is greeted by his cousin Roman Bellic who has offered to let him stay and work for him to earn some cash. Niko, hoping to settle down and find a girl, soon finds out that his past in Russia has followed him to America. He soon is betrayed by a group of people he thinks is his friends. The person who betrays him turn out to be a Russian who is friends with the person Niko had been trying to escape from. The gameplay in GTA IV is very good. You can hold the left-trigger half way down for free zoom or hold it all the way down for lock-on. You can carry as many weapons as you can find. There is anything from a sub-machine gun, shotguns, to sniper rifles. Each weapon is good for certain tasks such as being in a massive gun fight or for stealth.The AI in the game is much improved. Civilians will fight back if you steal their car and they react to if you pull out a gun and shoot it. The enviroments are wonderful. The city is huge and has no load times during the game. You can go from building to building with no loading. The graphics are beautiful for such a large area to cover and it has almost no framerate issues. SOmetimes I notice minor slow down but nothing to interupt your gameplay.Don\\'t get me wrong the game is not perfect by any means. Sometimes I have trouble getting in to games online. I will enter a deathmatch and I will be kicked out for no reason. \\xa0Also I will sometimes notice my people I am escorting or teamed with stop shooting or stand still for a second as if frozen.The little details is what makes this game amazing. You can go into your apartment and turn on your TV. There are several different stations that have new shows on pretty often. Also going to a comedy club is hilarious. The jokes are funny, and you can sit there and watch several shows of comedy or hang at the strip club for hours. The thing about this game is it provides hardcore and casual gamers with several things to do.Also it is nice to be able to feel a connection with a character for once. You can almost feel sorry for Niko because he deals with problems in life a lot of people face. Maybe not to the extent of feeling like killing someone, and actually doing it, but you really can connect with him.The game is not perfect by any means, but if you don\\'t own this game and can\\'t decide what to get next then I strongly suggest looking at this game.',\n",

       "  'description': \" Kingdom Hearts 2 is the sequel to Kingdom hearts one, which was one of the best Square Enix game. One year after Kingdom Hearts one; Sora, Donald and Goofy awake from a deep sleep after the events of chains of memories. Now awake, they embark in one final adventure to find the king, and Riku. You travel through Disney Worlds and original, hoping to find them however you stumble across and organization called: Organization 13; a bunch of nobodies who want one thing; to be somebodies. A nobody is a creature that is born when ever a heartless is defeated. You first play as Roxas; a boy living in Twilight Town who keeps having dreams and flashbacks about Sora's adventure in Kingdom Heart 1. You then encounter nobodies and have a keyblade. Why does Roxas have flashbacks, why did a keyblade choose him and why are there people in hoodies chasing him? I won't spoil it, or tell you what happens you'll have to find out yourself.  The gameplay has improved. You now can control who Donald and Goofy fight, so that it's easy for you. They decided to make the game user friendly, rather than before. The AI has improved; making the game more challenging. You now have a drive from, meter. Drive form is when you combine either Donald or Goofy into yourself and you end up with astonishing results. You become faster and even have two keyblades, with Goofy meaning your strong as hell. With Donald you become extremely slippery, smooth and fast. You also are able to shoot with your Keyblade at far enemies. Also if you join them together you get master form; I won't spoil that for you. You get these at different stages of the game. Using this drains your drive meter. You also have levels for your drive form and when you ascend you get more abilities.  You still have magic and all off that. You can now equip yourself with abilities; these could be from having a strong block or even increasing a magic spell. You also have an AP meter, which allows you to use up to a certain number of abilities. You also now have a limit meter. When you're in a tight spot or with a party member you can use a limit command and you do a combo move with the certain party member. If you got to abilities you can use this as a reaction command. A reaction command is when you can press triangle and you do a reaction. For example, you're facing a nobody and you press the reaction command; you then go behind them and attack. You can summon like before but this time it wastes you drive gauge.  The graphics haven't improved greatly from the first Kingdom Hearts and at times look outdated. However special cut scenes look marvelous. The sound is at its best. After playing you'll go out humming the music which makes you experience the game more and more. The Disney characters and worlds in the game have improved. There are more worlds from cartoon to real. Also if you enter a world you become adapted to that world via appearance or costume e.g. In the Lion King World you become a lion and in Halloween Town you wear a scary costume. There are many worlds from Pirates of the Caribbean to Mulan's world. It's a game filled with many cameos. One of the major cameos is Auron but I'm not going to go into that. Over all Kingdom Hearts 2 is a game that will keep you occupied, happy and is worth your money. \",\n",

       "  'description': 'BF: BC is a military first person shooter in the battlefield franchise. This is the first battlefield game to have a meaningful story campaign. In past battlefield games the real meat of the game was the multi-player component.  The story of BF: BC follows Bad Company, a group of misfit convicts that don’t get sentenced jail time and instead get placed in the army. The crew completes their missions as they are told to by their superiors. After fighting their way up a hill they discover that they are fighting mercenaries hired by a legionnaire who loves gold. This sets off the Three Kings style quest for gold.  The story is actually really good. It’s a humorous take on war told through cut scenes viewed through your characters eyes. The fact that you usually only fight with three other soldiers allows to connect with them easily. The story keeps you entertained all the way through the game until a final battle with the legionnaire which ends the game abruptly. By the end of the game you realize that the game isn’t all that long.  The gameplay is usually the standard FPS type gameplay broken up with a few vehicle segments. All the vehicles you see in the game are fully drivable. An interesting new design choice that makes the game pretty easy is that when you die you respawn with no penalty back in the world. All the enemies you killed and objectives you completed before dyeing stay the way they are.    A back of box feature that the game includes is almost fully destroyable environments. Basically if you cause an explosion on or next to a wall or a tree or something it gets blown up. The reason I say *almost* destroyable is because while you can blow holes in walls the foundation and certain parts of the building stay invulnerable and trees can only break at a certain point. In single-player this would feel like more of a feature and not a gimmick if the AI were to use their own holes to get to you. However, in multi-player this is used more effectively  The multi-player is extremely fun. It offers the same leveling up system from Call of Duty 4 and the same team oriented, class based, competitive gameplay from past Battlefield. The game offers several different maps with good variety in landscape but they generally play the same. This was supposed to be the first single-player centric although being a Battlefield game the real meat of the game is the multi-player.  The game comes with only one gametype on the disc. It’s a fun gametype called goldrush in which one team must defend crates of gold while the other team must destroy them. It offers for some good strategy but from my experience the attacking team usually seems to win more often. It’s a real bummer that the game only comes with one gametype but developer Dice says that they will patch in more for free.  Battlefield: Bad Company offers a good but below average length single-player campaign and a fun multi-player component that will keep me coming back for more.',\n",

       "  'description': 'GTA IV has been the most anticipated game ever over the last few years. Mass amount of hype was generated over the course of 2 years after a series of trailers and information was drip fed to fans and press everywhere. And after playing the game for more than 20 hours, let’s see whether it’s been worth the wait.  First of all, let me please apologize for taking\\xa0some time\\xa0to review the game, I just couldn’t bring myself around to stop playing the game in order to review it - it’s simply that good! Anyway, onto the review. Back in April 07′, Rockstar announced they were heading in a totally new direction for Grand Theft Auto; realism and after spending time with the game, it’s clear to see why. But let’s begin with the story and setting of the game. Players control the character Niko Bellic, an Eastern European immigrant who fled his war-torn country to come to America’s Liberty City after his dreamy cousin Roman\\xa0promised fortune, women, cars and a good life. Little did Niko know what a\\xa0lyer Roman was;\\xa0in an attempt to get Niko to help him with his debts with high-rolling gangsters. Unlike previous GTA’s, this is no rags to riches story, but something much more realistic in this day and age, it is more of a rags to better rags scenario. Niko is easily the best character Rockstar has created, he is the most deepest and realistic to date and they did a brilliant job at making players feel for him - as if you actually want him to succeed in his struggle against the big guys. A new addition to the story are choices. At various points in the game, players will need to make decisions which will genuinely affect the outcome of the game, and the choices are actually pretty difficult to make, so that just shows how well Rockstar implemented them. GTA IV essentially plays like a top quality hollywood action film. The single player aspect will take most gamers around 25-35 hours to complete but for those who wish to get that 100% achievement,\\xa0will find themselves looking at around 60-80 hours to fully do the task set by Rockstar. So this means that even after completing the game, there are endless amount of stuff to do; steal nice cars, race, tour around in an helicopter, rob a bank, play darts, get a private dance at a strip club, go on a killing spree or just cruise about listening to the awesome soundtrack. The list could easily go on. Let’s take a look at one of the most important aspects of the game; the city itself. GTA IV is not the first time we’ve\\xa0visited Liberty City, but it’s the first next-gen GTA which gave Rockstar a chance to make something special out of it. Although Liberty City is not as ‘big’ as the previous San Andreas map, it’s 1000% more packed with attention and detail. Rockstar must have spent ages perfecting detail to it, each street is carefully named and contains tons of little bits which make it so real. You’ll see\\xa0pedestrians walking by talking to people on their mobile phones, people carrying shopping or reading newspapers and teenagers or street corners hanging around in a gang of them. I can honestly say that Liberty City is as realistic and\\xa0breathing as you can get in a game to date. Another thing Rockstar updated thanks to the new next-gen hardware is the graphics. Past GTA’s were more cartoony than life-like but this time, Rockstar decided to change… and wow! The graphics are brilliant - not the very best around but seeing as though it’s an entire city, you could say it is a masterpiece. Skyscrapers reflecting off the murky water, expensive cars with blood stains over them, bridges lit up in the background - simply breathtaking.\\xa0Character models are also more realistic this time around. But it should be mentioned that there are occasional texture pop ups and a few rare frame rate issues every now and again, but it doesn’t stop you loving the game one bit!\\xa0The sound & music is also top quality too, sounds of cars and guns sound great and the busting streets sound\\xa0almost realistic, with surround sound it \\xa0would sound bloody jaw-dropping. GTA IV also features a really cool soundtrack and as usual, Rockstar did a fantastic job at picking songs for each radio station, there is so much selection. You’ve got Electro/Dance, Jazz, Classic Rock, Funk, Punk and even talk shows - there’s something for everybody.\\xa0A personal favourite is driving\\xa0through the\\xa0Star Junction listening to Queen’s One Vision is class! Now onto the next major aspect of the game, multiplayer - which is so fleshed out it could easily be sold as a separate game. Rockstar managed to pull of a whopping 16 player online feature with 15 different game modes. Yeah, there’s standard deathmatch and races but whats special is the more unique modes such as Cops N Crooks, GTA Race and Mafiya Work. I’m not gonna go through each one as that would take quite some time but just know that the mulitplayer part is so fun, I reckon it will be very popular after people start moving from the single player part. Oh, and there is also free roam for up to 16 players. Awesome! So has the wait been worth it? I can honestly say that yes, it has. The jump from San Andreas to IV is just as big as GTA 2 to III, if not bigger. Rockstar managed to not only talk the talk but walk the walk, a feat that most developers now are plagued by. So what’s next for Grand Theft Auto? No one knows just yet, but whatever Rockstar does, you can be sure it will nothing short of legendary.',\n",

       "  'description': 'When Rockstar Games announced that Bully was being remade for the Xbox 360 and Nintendo Wii back in July 07′, I was\\xa0extremely excited at the thought of a ‘next-gen’ version of one of my favourite PS2 games. I wondered what new\\xa0content Rockstar would put into it and the thought of multiplayer also was a pleasant thought [Though, I was hoping for online multiplayer but never-mind]. So is this ‘Scholarship Edition’ worth buying? Let’s find out!  When I first started playing\\xa0Bully: SE,\\xa0what stood out the most was\\xa0just how dated the graphics look now, back in 2006 on the PlayStation 2, they graphics were fine; actually, they were pretty good. It had a certain ‘look’ to it. But now, it seems that compared to the new heavy-weights such as Call of Duty 4, Assassins Creed and Devil May Cry 4, it looks mediocre. Yes, Rockstar have updated the graphics with prettier textures and better shadows, but it still doesn’t stop it from looking like a PS2 game none the less. Cut-scenes are probably the worst looking part of the game, the characters still have a rectangular look to them, and facial animation look dated too. But all this doesn’t stop Bully: SE from being a good game, because it is actually a brilliant game. Bully: Scholarship Edition excels at gameplay; a great story, great setting and a huge range of fun and diverse missions, and to top it off, loads of side-missions and stuff to do around the school and town of Bullsworth, which keeps bringing you back for more. The basic story is; Jimmy Hopkins, a 15 year old rebel who is dropped off at the worst school in the country by his mother and newly wedded step-father as they bugger off on their honey moon. Your left to fend off bullies, misfits, teachers and more, who are all out to give young Jimmy a hard time. Some people may think the game only takes place in the school, but not only do you have the entire school you explore, but also the grounds, and later in the game; an entire town with it’s very own beach and carnival to visit! It’s pretty big. But not only is it big, but there’s loads to do as well. Apart from the main story missions, there’s also classes to complete [Same as PS2 plus an additional 3], tons of side-missions which earn you stuff such as money ect, races to compete in, places to visit [i.e. carnival] and even just messing about is great fun too. Missions are varied which will mean you never get bored - trust me, some missions are so fun, you may wann replay them. Missions range from sneaking into the girls dorm and taking pictures to using your slingshot to attack Jocks from a tree. Rockstar definitely did well with this. The Scholarship Edition now features extra missions too, so that’s a bonus. Bully [Canis Canem Edit] was a brilliant game on the PS2 and this re-vamped edition is no different. But just know, don’t expect a game with the same polish and flair\\xa0as top Xbox 360 games, as you won’t be getting it. If you never played the original, then I would definitely recommend this, especially with 8 new missions, new classes [Maths, Biology, Music]updated graphics, a new multiplayer mode [Not online though] and don’t forget achievements. If you have played the original then it is up to you; I mean, Bully: Scholarship Edition is only $49.99 [£30] but if you own/owned the first one, is it worth paying that much for a few new missions and updated graphics? Personally, I have had both, and I don’t regret it.',\n",

So maybe it just didn\\'t live up to the hype but I think it\\'s just as bad as I think it is.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 First off the combat system is far to easy and boring, you can get through every fight in the game by simply taking cover and using the lock on feature to pick all enemies off, with no need to aim at all, fights get extremely repetitive. The biotic and tech abilities are either overpowered or underpowered and like the fights get repetitive. The story is only just so so and isn\\'t as well done as it could have been. The things that admittedly does live up to the expectations is the conversation system which is very nice the FIRST time through, and the main characters are very nicely designed with good back story especially Wrex he\\'s my boy. All the classes are stale and really unoriginal the first three are just pure classes for each category and the other three are just a few of the possible takes on combining them, custom class support of some kind could have solved that but no.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 That\\'s just the main stuff the \"planet exploration\" don\\'t get boring they are boring each explorable planet is just a randomly colored square with a mine or mineral deposit here or there oohh fun let\\'s go find them. The side quests are nothing to really speak of, some are fun, but most are stupid and useless. The ending and final boss fight which I won\\'t spoil for anyone was disappointing and neither were worth the sixty dollars I payed. The achievements are stale and not fun at all and require three play throughs to get them all I could not possibly get through that without ripping my eyes out because of boredom.Overall this game is a rent at the most, don\\'t pay money for this game it\\'s not a complete peace of hot steamy garbage but it doesn\\'t live up to it\\'s potential, it\\'s horridly bad points outweigh it\\'s few fun parts, and it\\'s a huge disappointment.

Everything you promised...except that last little tidbit.Gears of War certainly looks stellar. Seriously, this game is beautiful. The devestated cities of planet Sera are gorgeous, despite their ruinous state; the game does indeed run quite smoothly; and although you didn't mention it, Cliffy boy, the sound is outstanding (shooting fools in surround sound: badassery); but, the action...

You just don't want me to have fun, do you Cliff?OK, OK, you got me. I did have a little bit of fun, on occasion--mostly when I wasn't dying. The problem, Clifford sir, is this: I died a lot.

       " {'deck': 'Haunting Ground (PS2) - Review by Kim Fidler',\n",
       "  'description': \"Have you ever seen a news story on TV that made you ask yourself why anyone would do such a thing? Haunting Ground, Capcom's latest horror offering for the PlayStation 2, is exactly the same type of thing - a voyeuristic adventure that begs to be played, even if it can at times feel quite unsettling. It is not unlike a car crash that is gawked at by onlookers and rubberneck traffic as they pass by, hoping to catch a glimpse of something they know they should not have seen.  Haunting Ground puts players in the role of Fiona Belli, a stunning young blonde that has found herself in a very strange situation; being naked (except for a strategically placed bed sheet), in a cage, and in some fat guy's blood splattered basement. Sound strange? Well, it only gets more and more disturbing as she gets out of her confinement and begins to explore her surroundings. In almost every conceivable way, Fiona is a stark contrast to the type of lead, female or otherwise, that usually headlines games. She is fragile, weak, and doesn't have an abundance of options going for her in terms of defending herself. In other words, she is easy pickings in the demented world she's been thrust into. That's where Hewie comes in. Hewie and Fiona meet very early in the game, and almost immediately he is cast in the role of her protector. Instead of being another gun-toting, fast-talking, military sort of character most players are accustomed to having around to fend off the forces of evil, Hewie is instead a simple dog - merely a companion that will help Fiona solve puzzles, reach certain places that only a dog could reach, and do his best to slow down any of Fiona's pursuers. It's a fresh approach and definitely one of the defining traits of Haunting Ground. Rounding out the cast are the antagonists of Haunting Ground. Daniella is a gothic hottie who has taken a rather disturbing interest in the enjoyment in pain that she cannot feel. Riccardo is the mysterious keeper of the house that does a good job of being... well, mysterious. And then there is Debilitas - quite possibly one of the most original and disturbing creations in survival horror to date. All of these characters play their roles perfectly, while maintaining their own separate identities. Without spoiling much in terms of story, suffice it to say that getting to know each of these personalities makes up a great deal of the enjoyment to be had in this game. One of the first things to be noticed about Haunting Ground that makes it different from other titles in the genre is the absence of 'filler' enemies. Gone are hundreds of nameless zombies, werewolves, and other clich� monsters players have become accustomed to killing in waves. Instead Haunting Ground employs the use of fewer, more fleshed out characters, giving players a better understanding into how they live and why they act the way they do. It provides the player a look into the creepy lair of Haunting Ground that houses the personification of sins everyone tries to hide, and brings them to life in the shape of Fiona's adversaries. Haunting Ground's gameplay does not follow the standard formula adopted by most other survival horror titles. Instead it relies on the basic mechanics utilized by less conventional titles such as the Fatal Frame and Clock Tower series. By relying on the main character's fragility, Capcom has created over 130 rooms that will challenge both the player's reflexes and brain. In some cases Fiona will be trying to figure out a puzzle barring her advancement only to be interrupted by someone who is out to kill her. Unfortunately she has to abandon her current task and run away as she is unable to fight off her assailant. Instead of giving her an arsenal of bazookas, assault rifles, and grenades, Capcom has stripped Fiona down to the basics of kicks, shoves, and mixtures that can be thrown. If caught in a situation without Hewie, or a hiding spot, Fiona is essentially a sitting duck. Reduced to running around for her life, this is where one of the most interesting features of Haunting Ground comes into play. The panic meter is never visible but a player can easily tell when Fiona is close to going out of her mind. As she gets more stressed, the screen will begin to distort, the sound will begin to get more and more grating, and Fiona will become harder to control as she stubbles about in her efforts to get away. The nice part of the feature is how it evolves over time. At first Fiona will be running just fine, only to tire down to a jog. As she slows down, the pursuer will gain ground on her until the panic meter reaches the point of pure adrenaline, oftentimes making the player (on some level at least) share in her need to escape. Hewie is what makes the gameplay in Haunting Ground both fun and frustrating at the same time. While Hewie is a great character when he is retrieving keys or pushing boxes, he is unfortunately one of the most difficult to control companions in videogame history. Thankfully, as time goes on, and as he is praised for his accomplishments, Hewie eventfully becomes a bit easier to handle. The player never actually gets to physically control Hewie, but they can use the power of suggestion to get him to do what they want. By utilizing the right analogue controls, a player can give Hewie commands such as follow, sit and, in battle situations, the command to attack. In exploration sequences, the possibility exists to have Hewie explore the area, and occasionally he will turn up some great items to help Fiona out. Mastering Hewie's control scheme makes the game infinitely easier, and many times more enjoyable for the gamer; plus it can lead to the opening up of some great secrets. The graphical style of Haunting Ground is nothing that has not been seen before, however the game does show how far the developers have come in terms of creating expressive, more well-rounded characters. Every personality in the game reacts to situations, and it is actually possible see and read the emotional responses in their faces. It goes a long way in being able to connect to Fiona as a character when a player is able to see the fear in her face whenever she encounters someone who wants to kill her. The other characters are modeled and animated in ways that would be expected of the type of personality they employ. Debilitas' mind of a 5 year old somehow translates over flawlessly in his huge mutant body by the way he moves, giggles, and stalks Fiona. Daniella moves in a cold, stiff manner that not only fits her demeanor, but it actually makes her a very creepy adversary in the way she follows Fiona around, devoid of any emotion. Aurally, Haunting Ground delivers in the all the right areas without reinventing or brining anything totally new to the genre. The voice acting is surprisingly very well done, and the characters' tone is always right on target. What really stands out about the audio in Haunting Ground is how each pursuer is accompanied by original theme music. Debilitas has the tortured score to accompany his personality, while Daniella's industrial theme is both strange, and appealing, just like Daniella herself. The sound is very well done, and it's nice to see the genre make such strides in recent years. Overall, Haunting Ground is a great game for fans of survival horror titles. It does what it sets out to do very well, without truly breaking any new or significant ground. The gameplay itself is very much in line with what has come to be expected of the genre. Similarly, the story, while appropriate, is tired at time, but even when it stumbles it never comes off as being in any way inappropriate or detracting from the overall experience. Haunting Ground is disturbing, demented, and very fun to play for those looking for something genuinely startling. Anyone wanting a game to keep busy with for a dozen hours on a dark night should give Haunting Ground a try.\",\n",

       "  'description': ' Two words to describe the game Crackdown would be *mindless fun*, there is little thinking involved in this game because the game play is revolved around you monkey jumping buildings and blowing the hell out of anyone who gets in your way, whether it be friend or foe. In that aspect Crackdown does a good job providing you with a good mixture of weapons that will keep you entertained. The basic pretense of the game is that you are a super agent who is charged with ridding the city of gang infestation. There are three different kinds of gangs(although they pretty much act the same way and do the same stuff) and there are 21 different bosses to find and kill. You are kind of an RPG agent in the sense that you have 5 major skills that evolve as you \"exercise\"/use them more them more. For example, one of your 5 \"core\" skills as they are called is firearms. So, the more you use your firearms, the better your auto aim gets and in general your accuracy improves. Likewise you have other skills like strength, which when you max out will enable you to pick up trucks and use them to crush enemies. While these elements of the game are entertaining, you will probably spend a lot of time jumping from rooftop to rooftop in search of agility orbs that improve your athleticism, enabling you to do some pretty wacky stuff(check out You-tube for some of the videos if you are interested). While leveling up these skills will keep you interested for some time, the game gets pretty repetitive and you will end up losing interest doing the same stuff over and over again. The game has some what of a main story line but it is really just an excuse to blow up some more stuff. With that said the game is definitely more fun if you have someone else along for the ride, especially if it is a buddy of yours and you are playing co-op. Nothing is more funny than knocking him/her/it off the top of a skyscraper when he/she//it just spent 5 minutes climbing it up. The game also looks very good, as the city is very well modeled and the especially the agency cars look very detailed and are very fun to drive.......... and crash. Over all Crackdown is a good game that has an effective game play mechanism but the lack of different sceneries doom the game. If you are looking for a game that is very accessible and somewhat of a stop-gap until the game you want comes out, then this is your game. ',\n",

       "  'description': 'Fair. What\\'s a fair score for a game that is rich with story and character development with breathtaking visuals to boot but fails in technical performance and repetitive environments? A game that leaves you speechless by the end but trying to drive around to complete missions and actually get to the end is a frustrating chore? A game where every choice you make will have an impact on how that mission, and possibly future missions, plays out but auto-saves are so poorly placed that failing a battle will have you talking through the same dialog over and over?  Before I go any further, let\\'s get one thing straight. I loved Mass Effect. Certainly one of the best games I\\'ve played in a long time. It could possibly go on my \"ever\" list. Despite all its technological shortcomings, 35 hours later I can\\'t wait to start all over again with a completely different character. It\\'s story isn\\'t original and is something of a hodgepodge of Halo, Star Wars, the Matrix, Contact, you name it. Some may call it predictable. But it works. And the characters make it work on a personal and emotional level as well.  Unfortunately, the game is riddled with problems that ruin the game for many. So let\\'s get those problems out of the way first.  Biggest issue? Definitely texture pop in (up?). The graphics in Mass Effect are gorgeous and understandably it takes time to load them – especially in open world environments where the system is trying to buffer data around your location before you get there. While a few games have been successful at this in the past it seems developers haven\\'t quite got the handle of it yet on the new consoles. So the biggest visual drawback is lots of texture pop in. Mostly only after loads but it can really occur anywhere. I even had it happening during cut-scene conversations which I think is inexcusable. That\\'s just bad programming and resource management.  Random loading. While you\\'re playing, Mass Effect is trying to load content into its buffer before you get there. Unfortunately, the buffer can\\'t always keep up, even when you\\'re not moving quickly. While it\\'s not nearly as bad as Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, it happens and anytime you\\'re walking around freely, only to be interrupted by a frozen screen trying to load content, it breaks the mood and takes you out of the environment. An interesting side-note: All the slow-moving elevators that people complain of are actually cleverly disguised loading screens.  Inventory management. This one has come up a lot. It was even discussed with the people at Bioware in a 1up.com article who said they didn\\'t think it was a problem. And no, it\\'s not huge. Inventory management is certainly doable. The problem is that there is no way to sort your items. So like Oblivion, you\\'re stuck scrolling through long lists of items. This is so easy to fix. Why can\\'t developers get this sort of thing right? And how do these poor management systems get approved to begin with?  Poorly placed auto-saves. Part of the problem here is that they\\'re inconsistent. On some missions they\\'ll be at the perfect spot – right after long dialog and right before the battle. In others, even if you save manually (which you can at any time as long as you\\'re not in combat) you\\'re forced to go through long sections of dialog before the difficult boss battle. Fail the battle and you restart from your last save (however far back that was) only to have to go through the entire dialog again... and again, and again. Very irritating.  Terrain variety and the Mako. Driving the Mako around in and of itself isn\\'t so bad. Sure, trying to back up or get turned around can be frustrating but I can deal with that. Mostly though it\\'s the terrain that you\\'re constantly bouncing wildly over that\\'s the issue. Why is it that every planet you land on has very little flat ground and instead has super steep cliffs that take ages to crawl up? Although it is nigh impossible to flip the damn thing. I did however manage to do it: on flat ground nonetheless. Which sucks because there\\'s no way to right the thing.  Terribly written love saga. For such a wonderful story this inclusion sucks. Seriously, who wrote this part? The same people that wrote Star Wars: Episode 2?! \"Hi, we just met. We\\'re suddenly awkwardly in love. Let\\'s do it. No, we have to wait.\" I\\'m all for a little love story but it could have been handled much better. For how quickly things start, the mood just wasn\\'t there.  Mission environment variety. It\\'s not really that the missions are repetitive. In any game you\\'re pretty much going to be doing the same thing over and over. The missions here even do a pretty good job at distinguishing themselves. But every moon base and cavern is exactly the same. You can walk into each one and know exactly which rooms the enemy will be in – also because there\\'s only four rooms. It\\'s for this reason that non-story missions begin to feel tedious. Enter a system. Pick the one planet you can land on. Bounce around wildly for 10 minutes. Reach objective, maybe encounter outside base defenses. Enter base. Enter hall. Enter main quarters. Defeat bad guys. Explore other two rooms and wrap up mission criteria if necessary. Blah.  Short. At 35 hours?! Yes. Truth is, if you skip all the side quests Mass Effect only has about 6 \"chapters.\" Each chapter may take you a couple hours to play through but it\\'s a little disheartening when you look at your mission list and can see 3 objectives that, once completed, will lead right to the last mission. More story development and searching the galaxy would have been excellent.  Crates. Yup, just like any RPG you have your standard crates full of weapons and health packs. Ok, cliché but no big deal. Except you have to play some little \"Simon\" mini game for nearly every one. Fine, but is that really necessary?  Unrelated dialog options. Admittedly, this isn\\'t a big deal and most RPGs of this nature are guilty of it but, to me, I feel it affects the mood of the game. The scenario is some kind of heated situation when suddenly you\\'re presented addition dialog options to inquire the person on a more personal level. It\\'s not the response you\\'d make naturally. And that response is present in your options. But you know that if you want to get more info and experience you\\'ll have to take that awkward dialog detour. So it\\'s a matter of do you stick to the feel of the situation or do you play the points game? I wish developers would come up with better solutions for these types of situations.  Still with me? Good. Because if you can overlook all of Mass Effect\\'s little inadequacies you\\'ll be immersed in an imaginative world full of unique and memorable characters with a great story to boot. Which is what this game is all about. If you can lose yourself in the story, then just like a good book, it\\'ll be hard to put down.  While it\\'s unfortunate that the revolutionary dialog system (the one that let you interrupt NPCs while they were talking) got dropped from the final build, you\\'re still left with several dialog options that will affect the outcome of that meeting and may impact future missions. Increase your Charm or Renegade attributes (I went Renegade which was a blast) and you\\'ll open more options that can dramatically change the course of a conversation or even avoid a conflict altogether. It\\'s through these options that you\\'ll face some tough choices – the outcome of several which will lead to some amazing \"holy ****!\" moments. The ability to make choices with a real impact as well as the number of different character c1asses you can create and teammates you can play with really adds some worthwhile replay value. It\\'ll be the same story of course, but it certainly won\\'t play out the same way twice.  Example: In one side quest I found myself confronting a soldier holding a scientist hostage at gun point. Well, no, not hostage. He was about to kill him. The scientist was meek and non-threatening so my initial reaction was to simply take down the man with the gun. I am a Renegade after all. But rather than hastely kill him, I chose to ask some questions and it turned out that the situation was related to an earlier mission and the scientist was part of a group that I had dispatched of earlier - so technically, I was on the same side as the would be killer. With this info I now had four options: kill the soldier; try to convince the soldier to \"stand down;\" let the soldier kill the scientist; or kill the scientist myself. I won\\'t spoil the ending but my version was definitely a \"holy ****!\" moment. I\\'m eager to find out how that, as well as many other missions play out when I make different choices.  And yes, that little irrelevant side mission was superbly detailed with unique actors for each part - or well unique enough. Which brings up the point again that the story and the visuals are really the hallmark of this title. If you\\'re willing to immerse yourself in this universe, the cut-scenes will be a joy and will carry you through to the end. And really, any time you\\'re talking with another non-player character it\\'ll be easy to get wrapped up in it. While the lip sync is far from perfect, it\\'s good enough to be believable. Add in the excellent voice acting, lighting, modeling and textures and you\\'re left left with truly cinematic scenes that are engaging and fun to watch as well as play through.  But the story is only half of it. This is an \"RPG-shooter\" after all. Even with some squad based tactical elements. This too I\\'ve heard complaints about. For me I thought it worked well. Your teammates may not be the smartest but I never once found myself at a disadvantage or killed because of their actions. That\\'s not to say that you or they won\\'t die. It\\'s not uncommon for them to die but it isn\\'t the norm either. Plus, you\\'ll eventually get a handy little ability to resurrect fallen teammates during battle so it\\'s not really an issue. Unless of course, \"dead\" teammates returning to \"life\" ruins the feel of the game for you. The key to combat in Mass Effect is using your team\\'s powers to your full advantage. Everyone has something to offer and in difficult boss battles it\\'s worthwhile to make use of those abilities.  Except for some frustrating boss battles, the combat is straight-forward and relatively easy - especially as your hero(ine) levels up and acquires more powerful weapons. Playing as a Vanguard, I found the Pistol/Shotgun combination to be quite effective - the shotgun taking down lesser foes with just a single shot on the Normal difficulty level (from just about any range). A nice feature of Mass Effect I feel is the leveling system itself. On normal your team will level up by themselves. As you increase the difficulty, enemies will level up as well to match you. Personally, I\\'ve never cared for enemies leveling up. I think it defeats the point of leveling in the first place. (If we\\'re going to remain on even ground, why go higher?) This seems to be a really good compromise however, allowing the player to adapt the game to their preference of play. On the whole, my teammates did a fair job of protecting themselves: they\\'d take cover and use shield power-ups when necessary while I managed their attack biotics and special abilities.  Mass Effect\\'s version of \"magic\" or \"the force\" is biotics. A special case that grants the wielder the ability to physically manipulate others around them. This includes things like pushing groups of charging enemies away with an invisible burst of energy or suspending them helplessly in the air, to disabling enemy shields or causing their own weapons to explode and damage them. While it\\'s doable to play through the whole game just shooting your way, I found it much more enjoyable when I employed my own biotic abilities in conjunction with those of my teammates to easily bring down difficult foes. There\\'s just a very satisfying sense of power when you can have one teammate disable the shields of a Geth Colossus while you lift it helplessly into the air with another going fully automatic on it with an assault rifle, then finishing it off with a shotgun blast of exploding bullets.  Despite side missions taking place in similar locations giving them a somewhat repetitive and tedious feel, they are enjoyable. The real meat of the game though is within the main storyline. Some of the side quests feel a bit tacked on as if Bioware was just trying to fill out the game and make it longer. While the story is very well developed as it is, I wish Bioware would have spent more time creating a longer story that involved more missions and more exploration and detective work.  When all is said and done, I think Bioware put out a remarkable product and I can\\'t wait for the sequels. While the ending of Mass Effect sets you up for the next chapter, it ends well with a fairly solid conclusion, albeit a bit cheesy. There\\'s still questions left unanswered of course. Mass Effect is intended to be a trilogy however and one that I\\'m quite looking forward to completing. And with any luck, Bioware will be able to complete all 3 for the 360 before the next-gen consoles.  While there are many technical problems, I never found them to be so distracting or insurmountable that they detracted from the enjoyment of the game. Driving the Mako got laborious and repeating scenes of dialog over and over after dying in battle was frustrating these were minor instances and once overcome they were quickly forgotten. Even the constant texture pop in after loads weren\\'t enough to disrupt my pure enjoyment of this story.  Whether or not Mass Effect is a must buy depends on your personal taste and own buying habits. Personally, I quite often regret outright buying games without trying them beforehand. Mass Effect is not one of those. I enjoy it immensely now and it\\'s the kind of game that I\\'ll be able to go back to a year later and enjoy all over again without feeling like I\\'ve \"been there, done that.\"',\n",

       "  'description': 'Crysis has been one of the most controversial games in history. It is a game that amazes with its spectacular visuals, frustrates with its heavy system requirements, and entertains with its gameplay. Many games do not get more than a few sentences regarding their graphics, however, Crysis is a completely different story. Crysis is perhaps the most technically stunning game in history. That is a pretty bold claim, but I think that Crysis defenitely delivers. The attention to detail here is amazing. Everything from small particles flying in the air,\\xa0 to rainbows forming when the sun reflects off the water in the right angle, serve to demonstrate how serious Crytek was about bringing this game to a whole new level of realism. There will be times when you will just want to sit back and enjoy the view. It may sound like an exaggeration, but I am dead serious.All of this visual wonder, however, comes at a heavy price. The system requirements of this game are very demanding. It needs to be said that even with an ultra high end rig, you will still experience lag on Crysis. As of now, it is impossible to completely max out Crysis at 1680x1050 or higher at very high with AAx16, and stay above the 60 frame per second mark. It is just an overwhelmingly demanding game. Your game will lag. Do as you may, it will occasionally dip to the low 20\\'s or low teens. On average, most gamers get anywhere from 20 to 30 FPS on high. This is certainly true for me. Although those numbers may seem low, the game remains playable. If you would like an even bigger performance increase, the settings can be set to a mixture of medium and high. This will allow you to retain some of the eye candy, and still get good performance.The gameplay in Crysis is quite different from many other FPS. Although you have your standard array of weapons, such as your machine guns, pistol, sniper rifle, shotgun, etc., what really sets this game apart is its use the \"nano suit\" and physics.The nano suit is just that. It grants the player special abilities such as stealth, strength, speed, and armor. These abilities allow you to tackle a situation in different ways. You can sneak around, taking out soldiers when no one is looking, zoom past all the action, fight your way through Rambo style, or a mixture of all of these. It is a fun addition that adds an extra layer of depth to this game.The other thing that sets this game apart from other FPS is its use of physics. Physics play a big role in this game. The problem lies in figuiring out how to use them. So many games exclude any real physics that we have never really learned how to use them. When I first played through this game, I played it like many other games, just shooting all my enemies. This led me a decent gameplay experience. However, what I soon realized was that I was playing the game wrong. I was playing it like I would play Call of Duty or Medal of Honor; I was not using the physics. As I tried to change this, I began to learn of neat little tricks I could do that made the game much more satisfying. For example, I realized that I could knock down buildings to kill my opponents instead of shooting them, or I could run them over, or I could throw them off cliffs. These new ways to defeat my opponents proved to be much more interesting and satisfying than just shooting them.Overall, Crysis is a great game. It will amaze you in many ways. The graphics, physics, and gameplay all combine together to create a deeply compelling experience. Do yourself a favor, and go buy this game today.',\n",

       " {'deck': 'REVIEW - Metal Gear Solid 4',\n",
       "  'description': 'http://patricknguyen.wordpress.com/2008/06/14/review-metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots/Metal Gear. Two words that make hearts jump. Two words that have become synonymous with ’stealth action’ and ‘cinematic storytelling.’ With its latest installment, it has set a precedent for the latter, no doubt. But what about gameplay? Does it support the weight of one of the grandest narratives in gaming history? First things first, and I feel the need to say this: MGS4 closes every loose end the series has ever let loose. Everyone who has played previous Metal Gear games will find the utmost satisfaction from every explanation Kojima has to give. When he said that this will be the very last in Snake’s saga, he does not lie. With the help of cutscenes, Kojima tells one of the best stories ever conceived. The series has shown the rise and fall of a hero, and no doubt will it be an emotional journey for anyone playing. The game shows so much character, meaning and emotion that it’s hard not to get attached to Snake and his never ending will to save the world. This time, though, it’s different. After playing this game, I did not first think about how they could expand on the story in MGS5. I did not even think about a sequel. This is because the story is tied up so nicely it leaves nothing more to be desired. One thing is for certain: Snake’s journey is over. On the gameplay mechanics side of it all, things are still hanging in great. Most of the elements which have bogged down the too-traditional gameplay in the past games have been refined. The camera, which was greatly modified in MGS3: Subsistence, is perfected in MGS4. The camouflage mechanic again makes its return from MGS3, but instead of having to change it manually each time you reach a different terrain type, it is fully automatic. The OctoCamo, as the game calls it, transforms its camo pattern to whatever Snake is touching while he is either pressed up against a wall or laying on the floor. This not only leaves the player without having to fiddle with the camo frequently, but it is also a cool effect. The gunplay has also been tweaked (read: Westernized/modernized) to provide better aim and an overall better feel.  Not only does the game refine all these gameplay elements, it adds a few new and interesting ones. For instance, MGS4 marks the introduction of the Threat Ring, which indicates the direction of enemies nearby with the use of a semi-transparent ring around Snake when he is crouching or lying down. This provides for easier recognition of enemy whereabouts and helps to prevent Snake getting seen by enemies he himself cannot see. Also introduced is the Solid Eye, which is a combination of binoculars, night vision goggles and an motion detector, which provides a general map of the enemies in the area. This lets the player find the enemies easier, and other uses as the game goes on. Also, after progressing through a bit of the story, you unlock the ability to buy weapons, ammo, and upgrades directly from your start menu. The upgrades range from silencers to laser sights to grips. While this may be too easy for some people, because generally you should be rich all the time, I would argue that it can mean more stealth play, as you can buy silencers whenever your current one breaks. While these new mechanics do add to the game, others do not, such as the Stress and Psyche meters. These meters usually never impact your play, unless you’re in the odd situation where you run out of Psyche and cannot aim (happened to me once). Basically, it seems Psyche is only there for comedic effects during the narrative sequences. Metal Gear Solid 4 features superb levels and environments. Each act, the environment changes significantly. This can be interpreted as disorienting or refreshing. The first three acts are arguably the best in terms of gameplay. They do feature the “tackle the situation in multiple ways” approach Konami has been boasting about the game, and it’s a very enjoyable experience. The last 2 acts, however, are very linear and feature mostly cutscenes. They’re more story-centric, and the actual game takes a back seat. The cutscenes, though, are amazingly well done and arguably have the highest production values of any game. Kojima is the king of video game cutscene direction. There are things in the game, camera shots and whatnot, that cannot be reproduced in a movie. One such example is the chase scene in the game. The scene is the most well directed chase scene ever made, period.  Also, the game has superb boss battles. The Beauty and the Beasts are a group of beautiful women who have been transformed by war, and are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. This provides for some very interesting and innovative battles. These boss battles make the player think in different ways, and the back story for these women also provide for good little side stories. This game is fantastic, to say the least. Any Metal Gear fan should buy it. It will be an amazing experience, especially if you own a decent surround sound system, as audio design is excellent in this game. Even if you didn’t like this game, you should give it a try, especially if what threw you off was its controls, which are greatly improved in this latest installment. If what threw you off was the convoluted story and length of cutscenes, this will just make you dislike the game even more. Sure, the game features top-notch gameplay, but it’s also cutscenes around a third of the time. If you enjoy the story though, this game will be a dream come true, and you’ll be happy to put down the controller to watch the epic narrative unfold in front of you. This game is a work of years of hard work and love, and it culminates the two-decade long story of Solid Snake. This was his final mission. And it was amazing.  Rest in peace, Snake. Here lies a true patriot.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Bioshock.The title of a game truly stands up for itself. You will be \"Shocked\" about how amazing this game truly is. Not only is it an FPS , but it is much, much more.I\\'m not going to ruin the story here for you, most of you probaly already know what the basic storyline is about. I\\'m going to discuss what actually makes this game unique from any other in it\\'s genre.Bioshock is a First Person Shooter, but also has RPG elements. Once you start to play the game you will see that you make choices that will effect the rest of the game. For instance, if you want to harvest, instead of saving a \"little sister\", you will benefit from it more in the short run, but in the long run you may not. Little sisters give you \"ADAM\" which is used to upgrade your character (more health, more mana, etc.)This game is single player only, but with a game as great as this, there is no need for online play.You have a large selection of weapons and \"plasmids\" which is like magic. Weapons include pistol, wrench, grenade thrower, shotgun, and much more. Plasmids include telekinisis, shock, freeze, incinerate, and much more.You can also hack robots or cameras so they are for your use. There is a short mini-game when you hack robots which kind of gets old after a while. You can also \"create\" special things like unique bullets, or buy medkits, or bullets from little stations places around the game.When you die, you are automatically taken to the nearest vita chamber. It makes your health go to the halfway point. Some people may not like this, but i myself find it helpful.Overall this is one of the best games out right now, if not the best, for the xbox 360, and i highly recommend it. It is one of the must-have titles and lived up to its hype. You will not be dissapointed. Note - This review was first written by me, Poker360, at gamespot.',\n",

       "  'description': \"I first heard of Bioshock at X06 and It has peaked my interest ever since. Every gamer should do himself a favour and experience Bioshock. The game is a breath of fresh air amidst all the similar games out there. The emphasis on BioShock is awesome storytelling combined with amazing gameplay. This is the first TRUE next-gen experience because it pushes the envelope in every way!  Gameplay: The gameplay is the best thing in BioShock. You basically choose how you want to defeat your enemies. You can use the traditional shotgun or freeze them with Ice then destroy them. Plasmids adds an amazing element to the game. The only issues I have with the gameplay is that it stutters some times, it's not really a problem but it's very annoying.  Graphics: The graphics are the best on the 360. The artstyle looks retro and futuristic at the same time. The colors are very vibrant and diverse not like your average FPS, then again Bioshock isn't your average FPS. With the help of UE3, Bioshock easily has the best graphics so far this gen. Irrational hired special programmers just for the water effects, and man do they look amazing.  Sound: The sound is the best part in Rapture. You hear all the leaks, footsteps, voices and everything else in between. If you have a Surround Sound system then you will be fully immersed in Bioshock, it will feel like you are there facing off against a Big Daddy. Irrational hit the nail on the head in the sound department.  Story: Usually we don't expect FPS games to have an intriuging story but guess what....Bioshock did and went past that. The story is easily the best part in the game. The story might be a little complicated if you don't pick up the audio diaries but that is okay. There are HUGE plot twists in Bioshock that will have you on the edge of your seat!  Characters: The characters in the game are nothing you have seen before. The Hunter and Gatherer mechanic is used to perfection with the Big Daddies and Little Sisters. You will meet alot of interesting characters during your stay at Rapture  Conclusion: If you own a 360 this is a must buy. Gamers, I can't stress this enough, You NEED to purchase/rent Bioshock. Ken Levine and everyone at Irrational (now 2K Boston) has delivered again with this masterpiece. I hope you enjoyed reading my review.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Remember Space Invaders? It was great wasn’t it? Shooting white-coloured aliens as they come closer and closer at accelerating speeds. Over and over. It was great, wasn’t it? Yeah, 30 years ago. But the year is 2008, people, and we deserve a new transformation of Space Invaders. One that will bring in young gamers but will trigger the nostolgia of old gamers. The new one is part of the 30th Anniversary for Space Invaders, and is a perfect addition to the aging series. Think of this game as the ‘Pac-Man Championship Edition‘ of Space Invaders. It invigorates the style and gameplay while also keeping the core elements intact. You still slide from side to side and you still shoot invaders that are coming towards you. But now, they can reflect shots back at you, become almost impossibly thin, become gigantic, or even split up into many invaders after they take a shot. Its not only the invaders that get special powers, however. The player also gets a whole bunch of power-ups. These include a big laser beam that engulfs everything it touches, a gun that shoots multiple lasers, one that shoots giant bombs, and another that gives you a temporary shield. There are also these sequences in which you have specific tasks, such as shoot down X number of invaders in this time span, and if you complete them you will get special bonuses, such as extended power-ups. All these new things, coupled with good ol’ Space Invaders, means for a fresh new game that you’ll enjoy for years to come.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Infinity Ward’s Call of Duty 4 does not do anything revolutionary, or that much different than other first person shooters, but it has instead perfects the formula. In single player you play as both an SAS operative Soap MacTavish, U.S. Marine Paul Jackson, and Lieutenant Price. The plot is delivered well through mission briefings, and a first person perspective. This with the plot twists make for a very enjoyable experience. The game’s missions aren’t only shooting your way to your objective. There is also some variety as you play as AC-130 gunner, and a Lieutenant Price as a sniper sneaking your behind enemy lines. The settings also have variety to them, with many great locals, from , , , and also an Airliner. Every moment of the game is intense, and exciting, but comes at a cost of a very short campaign roughly 4-6 hours to complete. But even though the single player is short, you will want to play it over again in the various difficulty levels, and you can also play arcade mode that scores you when you are playing single player.  Even if you don’t play the single player, the multiplayer will keep you occupied for a long time. It is one of the best and deepest multiplayer games I can remember. The game is fitted with a levelling/ranking system, and customizable characters via perks, and gun attachments. You customize your guns colour, and what attachment goes for it, as you level up. Also perks is an interesting addition to the game, as it changes the game play quite a bit. You can have 3 perks, from 3 categories. Some cool perks include last stand, which allows you to use the pistol and try to get some extra kills after you are down. Others include double tap which increases rate of fire for your weapons, bandolier which gives you more ammo for your weapon. You also get rewarded for killing streaks, 3 kills gets you an UAV, 5 kills gets you an air strike, and 7 kills in a row gets you a helicopter. Even with all these additions made to the Call of Duty formula everything feels balanced, and extremely fun. The game can have up to 18 players, and there are 16 maps in the game, with 4 more as downloadable content. There are also many game modes from your traditional deathmatch, and team deathmatch, to headquarters which is like a king of the hill, where the team holding the HQ doesn’t respawn, to Search and Destroy the offensive team must plant a bomb in the bomb site, while the defenders must stop them. All game modes will appeal to everyone from the team player, to the lone wolf.\\xa0   The graphics are great, and are very realistic, and also runs very smoothly. The sound is top notch from the explosions, gun sounds, to the music. The single player is short, sweet, and immersive, while the multiplayer is deep, and rewarding. If you aren’t a shooter fan Call of Duty 4 won’t change your mind about the genre, but if you are a shooter fan this is one of the best shooters that has ever been made and perfected.  ',\n",

       " {'deck': 'Dark Sector almost hits the mark',\n",
       "  'description': 'Dark Sector is a game that manages to pluck a chord with fans of the Gears of War style third-person shooter with that familiar over-right-shoulder camera viewpoint. Unfortunately, being a clone often means that doing something new is out of the question. Dark Sector manages to take an old style, bring new game-play to it, but fails to do much more than that.  Immediately after putting the game in, one will notice the breathtaking graphics of what you can only assume is the latest build of the Unreal Engine. The prologue takes place entirely in black and white, just like an old film. Adding context to the feeling of it being non-color is the fact the series of events takes place in an alternate reality Russia in the 1980\\'s. During a deep-sea excavation a mysterious, yet highly infectious plague has come back with the naval team and has infected most of what we would consider the Soviet Union.  Since the game struggles so hard to be the new Gears of War, you\\'ll find that all the cover mechanics work pretty much the same, just less elegantly. Instead of being able to run directly into cover you have to stop and hit up on the analog stick + A, this just slows things down and can cost you a life or two when playing on the harder difficulties. The other controls are borrowed from other places and there\\'s no real issue with any single one of them apart from the cover system.  The new idea that Dark Sector uses to set itself apart from the (now) highly over-mentioned Gears of War is a weapon called \"The Glaive.\" This is a cross between a boomerang and a knife. Curved into a circle this highly destructive weapon can cut limbs off of enemies as well as retrieve distant items and power-ups. After a while your character gains the ability to control the Glaive in mid-flight. This can be useful for hitting specific points on a boss creature or decapitating an enemy for a quick kill. Unfortunately, in the night levels, the overuse of blur effects makes hitting a target near impossible.  The worst part about Dark Sector\\'s controls is that apart from the Glaive, there is no tutorial telling you which buttons do what, so for the first part of the game if you didn\\'t know better, you wouldn\\'t know there was even a cover system in place. This can be highly annoying once you realize you have to test every button and figure it out. This isn\\'t to say there aren\\'t sequences later on when you acquire new powers, there is just nothing upfront in the first level like you would expect to find in a Gears of War or similar title.  For the moments you can\\'t hit targets with the Glaive, there are guns in Dark Sector that you can use. These are armed with a device called \"governors\" which will destroy the weapon within around 30 seconds after you pick them up. This is because at some point during the game you become infected and the device prevents the use of weapons by infected people. You can buy guns without governors in the black market (for a price of course) but most of the time if this happens you\\'ll be trying to melee the enemies. Due to the inclusion of a finishing system you can pull off brutal kills in short cinematics after you damage an enemy a certain amount. The bad part is that it is never quite clear how much damage is required until an enemy turns red indicating you can do a finisher. Most of the time you\\'ll simply kill off the attacker in your attempts.  However, usually when these annoyances occur you\\'ll be overwhelmed by a sense of immersion and anticipation because the graphics carry this title a long way. Unreal Engine 3\\'s latest update contains some of the best visuals ever seen on consoles. It doesn\\'t make the same leap as the original Gears of War did, but it certainly makes vast and noticeable differences right from the first level. Color correction and particle effects are all highly elegant and realistic. During the game you can add elements to your Glaive by running it through fire or an open electrical field to get the desired effect. In fact, some of the fun of Dark Sector is taking these new elements like ice and fire and using it on enemies and the environment just to see how it looks and affects other things around it.  The game\\'s real flaw isn\\'t where it copies from or where it tries to go. It\\'s the complete lack of a story coupled with waves of enemies over and over again in every level. Mainly the waves of enemies are controlled and not completely ridiculous, but the lack of story really gets in the way, and when new characters are introduced it is almost never clear who they are, why they are important, and where they belong in the back-story. In fact, the story is so lacking, that if there was one the game would\\'ve enjoyed a ton more success and been a really interesting place to explore.  Overall Dark Sector isn\\'t a bad game, but if you\\'re looking for a really new experience or an interesting story you won\\'t find it here. Instead of being a blatant copy, this title manages to introduce a lot of new elements that, if you\\'re a fan of third-person shooters and you don\\'t mind a bit of repetition, is definitely worth a look at the very least.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Devil May Cry is a longstanding franchise that traditionally has been a Playstation exclusive is now out on the Xbox 360 to great surprise and joy of the user base. Finally, a great hack and slash game for a new group of people to try, but is it worth your 60 bucks?  The first thing to keep in mind is that Devil May Cry 4 is not just a hack and slash game but also an action-adventure game set in a fictional world. Unlike the previous games though, DMC4 may be considered a departure from the series for multiple reasons, the foremost being that you only play as Dante for less than half the game. The game introduces a new character as well who is the main focus of the story and the first half of the adventure, and since Dante is also motivated by his actions, that would make him almost more important of a character in the grand scheme of things.  Nero, the new character, is not a religious man. He and one of singers at his church, Kyrie, have a little something going on. So naturally the game starts off with Nero being late and Kyrie looking for him while singing her piece during mass. Kind of typical; that being said, Kyrie is also the sister of Credo, a member of \"The Order\" a nefarious organization that you\\'ll learn about over the course of the game, so I won\\'t give too much away here about it.   If you\\'re a hardcore Devil May Cry fan and you\\'re immediately disappointed by the lack of Dante in the game you won\\'t be upset for long. Less than halfway through the opening cut-scene Dante drops in on a church session that Nero and Kyrie are attending for seemingly no other reason than to assassinate the pastor leading the mass, Sanctus. Thus, the events set off by him turn the cogs of destruction and mayhem that lead the course of the newest iteration of the franchise.  The playing style from experience players will have to be slightly refined to match Nero, as he\\'s the character you\\'ll play for most of the game. While not too dissimilar from Dante, there are a couple key differences that make him a unique character. Both Nero and Dante have gigantic disproportional swords, but Nero has a sword with a handle that resembles a motorcycle allowing you to rev it up to make the blade get red-hot to increase the damage with doing a move combo. This allows you to do some really damaging moves if you time your button hits right. Nero also has an arm called the \"Devil Bringer,\" it looks and acts like a demonic arm should. When doing combos with it you\\'ll pull off some extremely damaging combos that you can even pull off in boss fights. Imagine picking the boss up and throwing him across the stage!  Other than those two differences though, the Devil May Cry formula hasn\\'t really undergone very many changes and retains the same basic puzzle structures and fighting moves you\\'ve come to expect, and that\\'s not all a bad thing either. While the game has a variety of environments you\\'ll traverse, it\\'s worth saying that this game looks amazing. From the first cut-scene you watch up until the last one, you\\'ll be oohing and ahhing at the gorgeous videos and the extreme attention to detail that is still rare in gaming today.   The loading times are minimal taking only a couple seconds to load each area. However, the areas are small and sometimes you\\'ll be wishing they took a couple more seconds to load a bit of a bigger area since you\\'ll be hitting a load every few minutes it seems like. However since there is no actual loading screen and it seems fairly instant, the only legitimate annoyance would be the noise it makes when you enter and exit an area. Talk about annoying!  The other annoying trend is also a major complaint with the entire game. Once you get exactly halfway through the game (which takes only about 5 hours) you\\'re forced to switch to Dante. This wouldn\\'t be so bad if you didn\\'t have to unlearn the \"Devil Bringer\" mechanic and retrain your mind without any kind of intro to the character (which would have been nice for newbies to the series like myself). However at this point, you have to backtrack through the entire game, fight every boss over again, and return to your starting point to finish the game. This both is annoying and obvious filler which they don\\'t even bother to cover up.   While you\\'re backtracking though, Dante acquires the most powerful moves and equipment for your face-off with \"The Savior\" (again spoilers I won\\'t mention). Some of the equipment includes Pandora\\'s box, which is basically a super-weapon that you can pull out at will. Dante can transform Pandora\\'s box into about 2-6 of the 666 possible combinations.  Clocking in at just 10 hours of game play for the average player who\\'s never touched a Devil May Cry game before, it\\'s the best hack and slash adventure game you can buy right now for $6 an hour. It\\'s not going to change your mind if you hate the genre, and it\\'s certainly not going to be the most innovative title you\\'ve ever played. But while the replay and the achievements might not be that fun or worthwhile, you\\'ll want to at least give this game a rental because of its phenomenal story and genuinely interesting characters.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Top spin 3 is a game which requires the player to know the controls for the game to become enjoyable.  Lets start with the graphics, the player models are great and really detailed so they look like tennis players such as Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Andy Roddick to name a few.  The animations for each character are well done as each tennis player has their own style at which they swing to hit the ball with.  Another thing great about this game exhaustion system.  As a match  progress or the player is running back and forth their heart rate will increase showing a sign of exhaustion.  Another sign of exhaustion is that the players shirt will begin to drench in sweat and their faces will pinken. Next is the gameplay as I said at the start to fully enjoy the game the controls need to be know,  otherwise the ball will pass you left, right and centre.  This is why it is important to use the top spin tennis centre to learn the basis.  The tennis centre will start to teach you how to swing, serve and later do more difficult techniques like pull off a drop shot and how to serve and volley.    The modes available consist of a quick match, career mode, online play, create a character and a place to buy equipment for the character. Quick match is simply a mode where you chose you tennis player and play a match of singles or doubles. Career mode is really basic in which where you take your created character and progress from a lowly amateur to a professional tennis player. Online play allows you to go online and play with others alone in single matches or with a friend against other players in a double match.  The doubles match can be played on a single console with two controllers. The create a character mode enables players to create a near prefect image of themselves with the accurate modelling tools. Unlike other tennis games like virtual tennis or smash court tennis, top spin does not have any mini games which help improve your character. To sum it all up top spin 3 is an ultra realistic tennis sim in which the results of not learning the games control will lead to a swift defeat. Pros:Great multiplayer, In-depth create-a-character features, exhaustion physics  Cons:Controls are difficult if time is not put in.   ',\n",

       "  'description': \"PROS: Great Graphics, Action Cut Scenes look awesome, Gameplay is amazing, Nero's Hand changes combat for the better, Bosses are huge and colorful, Storyline is actually pretty good. Also... One Liners are cheesy, but damn i like em anyways  Cons: A lot of backtracking, repeated boss fights, very few environments (there is like 3 in the whole game pretty much), Characters like Lady, and Trish have very minor roles. Some weird puzzle like missions are not fun.  Devil May Cry has had a really interesting history. It began as actually a sequel to Capcom's Resident Evil series! However it later got switched to its own project, and changed dramatically from there. Devil May Cry is born. The series that is known for crazy action scenes, cool main character in Dante, and lots of cheesy one liners. But The game was awesome. Then they made a sequel. BAD it was one of the most disappointing sequels ever. Then DMC 3 brought the game back to its glory days. All three were for the PS2, and times are changing. With the next gen systems coming out, The next DMC was announced, and it would be on not only PS3, but Microsoft's Xbox 360. How does the game fair?  You begin the story in what seems to be a religious group of people who worship Sparda, Dante's Father. You are introduced to a new character, who looks a lot like Dante. but instead he is more childish, and he's got a messed up hand. (more about that later) So after you are late to ceremony, Dante comes through the glass, shoots the leader. And then goes after everyone else. After that, your goal as Nero is to hunt and track down Dante. However as the story goes on, it starts from there, but ends up fighting a giant rock like idol, and finding out some very shocking secrets.  Instead of having Dante as the lead character, most of the game you play as a new character named Nero. Nero is similar to Dante in that he has a huge sword, white hair, guns, and is bad ass. But just not as much, and seems a bit more whats the word... Immature? He is a lot less calm and relax then Dante always is. But having said that the main difference between the two, is the Hand. Nero has a possess hand, that has really neat powers. Nero can pick up people in the air, he can choke them and throw them on the ground. Also he can get to unreachable places. The hand really changes up the gameplay.  The gameplay with Nero is a lot different then other games in the series because of that. Its no longer just about swords and guns. With Nero swords and guns are in play, but hand is vital for long range, and getting people into your combos. However its not like they forgot about Dante. When you get about oh half way through the game, you play the majority of the next half playing as Dante.  Dante comes with 2 different kinds of guns, and a sword. However as you play later on, you find a whole bunch of new guns and swords, that are freaking crazy. Some of the coolest weapons in a game. Dante is the more traditional DMC gameplay. And its nice that you get to play as both, because both styles of the characters are different.  Most of the game takes place in only 2 places. This castle, which is located in a icy region. and a forest behind the castle. Its really disappointing that they did not add other settings, and you have to play through the same levels twice. Yeah thats right. One time with Nero, and another With Dante. Of course its going to be different slightly. But repeated bosses (you have to beat each boss 3 times!) Its the main downfall of this game.   Along with that there is parts of the game where you need to smack these giant pillars into there correct spots. This is not fun in any way. There is no need for it, and its just tedious as all hell. As well as not the best platforming gameplay in the world. The game is about action, and there are times where you need to jump to different places, and the controls for that part are not that great.   Gameplay like a said has changed, but it still is high paced and fun as it ever was. The main reason you play this game is for the high action in the game, You have kick ass combos, cool villains, and its never been better. The graphics help out with making the action even better then the old games as well  Overall DMC 4 is a great addition to the series. You get a whole new set of characters, and villains. You also get a better looking DMC game that is always nice. Its worth picking up, and if you have been a fan of DMC, you are fool not to pick up this game. The backtracking is annoying, but the action is too good, and the cut scenes are just plain kicking!  Breakdown Gameplay: Its high action is a huge positive, but repeated boss fights, and backtracking is a negative.  Graphics: one of the better looking games for the systems. a Big step up from the older games in the series Sound: I like the battle music, but if you don't you will find it annoying fast. But great voice work not the best script, and good overall music Value: Different difficulty levels, and secret missions are worth replaying.. but the core game is short Overall: Nice game to the great series, puts the game to next generation!\",\n",

       "  'description': \"In a season where Wii games are exceptionally rare, not to mention good games, people tend to notice any sort of release. Instead of a new Resident Evil adventure, Capcom chose to (yet again) re-release Resident Evil 4 following the adventure of former cop, now secret service agent Leon Kennedy and his quest to save the President's Daughter. Now adapted for Nintendo's revolution, the Wii.  For those not already familiar, this review will be a mere glance back at Resident Evil 4, and take the most notice of the controls and bonus missions rather than go back over the game's story yet again. Taking place in a foreign country Leon Kennedy is tracking the president's daughter on a rescue mission. Apprehended by terrorists, Leon stumbles onto a conspiracy to revive the now defunct Umbrella corporation with the help of a thought-to-be extinct species of parasite called the Las Plagas. The mission remains the same, but the inclusion of Wii controls allows for a much more controlled and precise aiming method not available on any other console. As with Metroid Prime 3, after playing Resident Evil 4 Wii Edition, it's extremely hard to jump to a normal control pad controlled first-person shooter. Even though on any controller the initial impression of the control scheme is “clunky” at best it takes only a short while to become accustomed to the Wii version and only a bit longer to start appreciating how good the set-up really is.  When moving using the control stick, to aim all the user has to do is press and hold “B” to enter the aiming mode. The camera then zooms in to just barely over Leon's shoulder and the Wiimote then serves as the aiming medium easily allowing the character to shoot arms, legs, or the head of an enemy much faster and accurately than a standard joypad. The inclusion of the Wiimote for aiming also allows Leon the ability to instantly react to a flying projectile, simply hold “B” and aim for the axe flying at his head and fire – all can be done in a split second and virtually impossible to execute in the same amount of time on a standard controller.  Reloading is even easier and much more intuitive than before. While in aiming mode, simply wave the Wiimote up and down rapidly once and Leon will reload his gun. This movement in a side-to-side motion when walking or running will cause Leon to pull out his knife, which is excellent for twitch reflexes when a zombie is right around a corner or there is a box to break and ammo (like all great Resident Evil games) needs to be conserved as much as possible.  Resident Evil 4 had this great game mechanic in which during a cinematic input was required by the gamer in order to survive a situation and then leaked into the game as a scripted dodge maneuver for boss fights in real-time! That great bit of gaming survives into the Wii version, and is arguably the most fun since instead of tapping “A” to dodge, you'll actually be waving the Wiimote to jump out of the way, shaking it back and forth to climb up from a ledge, or sweeping down to duck as a sword comes at your head. The Wii version showcases as many great uses of the Wii remote without over-doing it or feeling like the controls were tacked on.  With the inclusion of “Separate Ways” the Ada side-missions to those Leon was on, Resident Evil 4 Wii Edition is the best 30 dollar at release title ever and certainly on the Wii. If you're looking for something to do before the next big thing, grab Resident Evil 4 off the shelf and have another go at those pesky zombies.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Kane's Wrath is the first expansion pack for the celebrated real-time strategy game Command and Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars. The game is an expansion pack, so it sells for twenty bucks less than a full fledged title, but you do not need to own Tiberium Wars to buy this game. This expansion pack builds upon the action-packed gameplay of the original title by adding two sub-factions for each of the game's three main races, effectively giving the player a choice of nine unique armies to play as. The Xbox 360 version also made some much needed changes to the control scheme, and also contains the platform's exclusive content: Kane's Challenge.The Good:The new controls work very well. It is now much easier to control your forces and build queues. Kane's Challenge is a welcome diversion to standard skirmishes you'll be spending most of your play-time engaged in. The live motion cut scenes are as cool and cheesy as ever. Some complaints have been made about the performance of a certain female actress in this game, but I didn't think she was that bad. All three armies have some fun new units to play with, including the aptly titled Epic Units, and in my humble opinion all six sub-factions are fun to play as.The Bad:The new campaign is very short, and you play as Nod the entire time. You will notice the same framerate issues that were found in the first game. There seems to be a small bug that myself and others have noticed: sometimes when you place a structure the controls will lock up for a few seconds.The Bottom Line:This game is worth the price tag and then some. It will completely replace the need to play the first game. So if you were thinking of buying the first one also, save your money. Also, at the time of me writing this, I believe this game to be the single best console RTS game on the market.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Back in 1999, Sega released the Sega Dreamcast, a quality system which eventually ended in failure. At the Dreamcast's launch, EA Sports declined to release the Madden franchise on the console, prompting Sega to find another football franchise to fill this gap. NFL 2K was the football series to take Madens place, and it performed excellently. The series continued in yearly installments, eventually gaining an ESPN license and moving onto the Xbox and PS2. Unfortunately, in 2004, EA signed an exclusivity agreement with the NFL, effectively shutting out all competition from 2K Football. The franchise disappeared for several years, only to be ressurrected with All-Pro Football 2K8. The series still has some serious fight left in it, but there are a couple glaring omissions that keep the game from reaching the heights of its predecessors.Since the NFL is now off-limits for everyone but Madden, 2K Sports decided to go with a more inventive solution. The game's roster is made up entirely of former NFL players, mostly Hall-of-Famers. This means you can finally assemble your dream football squad. Want to go for an all-out assault with Dan Marino and Barry Sanders? How about the epic team-up of Bubby Brister and Yancey Thigpen? Go ahead. All 240 legends in the game are ranked as either a Gold, Silver, or Bronze star player. At the beginning of the game, you choose 2 gold, 3 silver, and 6 bronze players. While an average football fan should recognize all of the Gold players and most of the Silvers, once you move into the Bronze tier, you'll start scratching your head. Any open positions left after your draft are filled by randomly generated players who do a decent job carrying out their roles.Once you move past the draft, the serious downfall of 2K8 is revealed. After naming your ridiculous made up team, you are presented with only four game types - Quick Play, Season, Practice, and an Online Match. For whatever reason, 2K Sports decided not to include a franchise mode in the game. despite the fact that ESPN NFL 2K5, the last 2K football game before this, did include it. This omission severely limits the replayability of the game, as after you beat Season mode once, you most likely won't do anything else but play online.Fortunately, the game shines in its most important area: gameplay. Simply put, this is the most realistic football game you will ever play. Every play and every formation you could want is included. Every player handles realistically, as opposed to the ice-skating running backs and ball-magnet recievers of Madden.The only detail that seems to plague all football games, what I like to call velcro tackles, still plague this game too. Whenever any player makes a tackle, they seemingly home in on their target and attach themselves instantly, like some strange adhesive is holding them to their opponent. Luckily the rest of the game overshadows this small problem.If you're sick of Madden's recycled games every year, and are looking for a new football game fix, do not pass up All-Pro 2K8. And if you were ever a fan of the series in the past, by all means, buy this game now. It's a worthy, though not perfect, continuation of the series. \",\n",

       "  'description': 'Shadow of the Colossus - a simple, yet highly effective game.  *STORY* The story of Shadow of the Colossus is pretty straight forward, yet very good. A young man known as the \"Wanderer\" (not that it\\'s his real name) takes a young woman named Mono who appears to be dead to a big temple. The young woman was said to be cursed and killed by her village or something. The Wanderer takes Mono to the temple and talks to Dormin, some sort of spirit. To resurrect her, the wanderer must find and destroy 16 beasts named the \"colossi\". Why? That\\'s for you to find out.  *GAMEPLAY: CONTROLS* The gameplay for SOTC is relatively simple. The X button makes the Wanderer call his horse, or if your horse is out of range and you are fighting a Colossus, you can whistle to attract its attention.  The square button makes you slash if you have a sword equipped, charge a stab if you\\'re holding on to something, and charge an arrow if your bow is equipped by holding square and letting go.  Triangle makes you jump, and if near your horse, you can mount your horse.  The circle button is mainly used with the sword. With the sword equipped, you can hold the circle button to raise your sword into the air. If the place you are in is bright enough, strings of light will emit from your blade. You can aim your sword until the strings of light join at the end into a point, and your controller vibrates. It points to the next Colossus you must slay. Also, if your fighting a Colossi using circle will show it\\'s vital spots, more on that on GAMEPLAY: FIGHTING COLOSSI. Also, if you’re near an alter of some sort that looks like a tomb stone, tap the circle button to pray. You will be fully healed and be able to save.  R1 is probably the most commonly used button in the game. It lets you grab. After pressing the triangle button (to jump) you can hold R1to grab onto something, like a ledge, some vines, or hair on a colossus. While holding R1, you can tap the square button to charge up a stab with your sword equipped, and tap it again to release your stab. You can move around while holding onto something, but you get very slow. If a Colossus begins shaking around trying to shake you off, you just hold R1 to keep holding. While a Colossus is trying to shake you off, you can\\'t stab. While hanging off a ledge, you can tap triangle to lift yourself up. While we\\'re talking about grabbing, you can\\'t hold onto something forever. In the bottom right corner, there is a circle with a square beside it and a bar under it. The square shows what you have equipped. It shows either a hand (for nothing equipped), a bow (for a bow and arrow equipped) or a sword (for, you guessed it, a sword equipped). The bar is your health bar. Once it\\'s empty, you\\'re dead. You can recharge health by just standing, praying, or kneeling, which is done by holding R1 on a flat surface. Kneeling makes you heal faster. The circle is your grip/power bar. While holding on, the pink circle begins to shrink. Once completely gone, you can\\'t hold on and must fall. You can regain your grip by waiting without golding onto something. When charging a stab or arrow, the circle begins to fill with a white circle. When the white circle completely fills the circle, your stab or arrow is fully charged. You can let go any time however. While holding on R1 on a flat surface, you will crouch, and tapping triangle while crouching will make you roll.  R2 makes you zoom in.  L1 makes you center the camera to the Colossi when fighting.  I don\\'t know what L2 does :-P. Never used it the whole game.  The right and left directional pads make you switch between weapons. Up makes you equip your sword and down makes you equip nothing.  The left analog stick makes you move, and the right analog stick makes you control the camera. You can control the camera in cutscenes too.  The horse is called by tapping X. His name is Agro (the horse). Mount the horse by tapping triangle beside him. To mount quickly, jump by pressing triangle and hold R1 to grab onto him. While on the horse, tap X to urge him forward. Every time you tap X, Agro goes faster. Steer with the left analog stick and hold down to stop. Hold R1 to lay down on him, and hold the left analog stick down while laying down to stand on Agro. Press triangle to dismount, and press triangle while still moving on Agro to jump off.  I may have missed some controls but I think I got the main concept.  *GAMEPLAY: FIGHTING COLOSSI* Each Colossi is different. Some fly, some walk and run, some stay put, some slither through the ground. Killing each Colossi is relatively the same but finding out how is the different.  This game is considered a puzzle game as much as it is a action/adventure game. Finding out how to kill each Colossus is hard, whether you have to climb up it, use your surroundings, or make it kill itself (you heard me right). It won’t really kill itself, but will really do things so stupid it practically dooms itself.  Mainly, you have to stab parts of the Colossi that do damage. These are called vital spots. Most Colossi have 1-3 vital spots. To get to the vital spots, you must go through a series of events. Sometimes, The Colossi will smash something causing it to fall. Then you can climb the thing taken down to get higher so you can jump onto the beast. Most Colossi are huge, and I mean HUGE. For example, one of the Colossi is practically as tall as a skyscraper. Some Colossi are about as small as your horse. Others aren\\'t very big but very long. Imagine climbing a skyscraper, only the skyscraper is trying to shake you off and you\\'re trying to find its vital spots to stab while your grip is loosening and you may plunge to your messy death bellow. Actually, If you fall from a hundred feet tall Colossi, you wont die, in fact you may only lose one fourth of your HP. The only annoying part is getting back up.  You will find yourself swearing at the Colossi telling it to stop shaking so you can stab it, or yelling at the wanderer to jump instead of hang onto a ledge like a sissy girl. Actually, the wanderer has some balls to be able to climb huge beasts out of this world, or hang onto a bull like creature that is ramming into walls trying to knock you off. Ya.  Finding the vital spots aren\\'t even half of the problem. In fact, it\\'s quite easy. Just like finding the Colossi, you can use your sword to find its vital spots. Getting there is the problem.  Some Colossi will require you to stab other parts of their body to get them to expose their vital spots. These are called trigger spots. For example, you can stab a trigger spot and the Colossi will fall so you can get on it, or the Colossi will cover the spot with his hand to tend the wound so you could jump onto that hand to go up to it\\'s vital spot.  Once you kill the Colossi, you will probably yell at the Colossi using inappropriate words I dare not put on this review. The music makes you feel almost sorry for the beast, and maybe you will. But probably you won’t because most of these beasts are very annoying and you will throw away the controller and sprawl on your back saying \"FINALLY, HE\\'S DEAD!\"  *MAIN OVERVIEW* The Colossi are the only enemies in the game, but if that keeps you from getting this game, then I have a couple of words. The land is huge, and you\\'ll never have any idea how good the detail is in the game if you go from Colossi to Colossi. The graphics are one of the best graphics in PS2, and the best in game graphics probably of any PS2. Comparing to some cutscenes in the Final Fantasy series, these graphics aren\\'t very good but compared to gameplay graphics in Final Fantasy, SOTC takes the cake. Each battle is thrilling. End of story.  The ending cutscene is great yet kinda scary. It\\'s about 25 minutes long, and sets up its sequel. Officially, Shadow of the Colossus is the PREQUEL of the game ICO. If you watch the ending cutscene and know what ICO is all about, it really sets it up. I won’t spoil it for you.  The replay value isn\\'t very good however. But you can go to time attack mode after you beat the game once by praying in front of a statue of one of the Colossi. When you pray, you can fight the Colossi and try to beat it in a certain time. Also, you can play in hard mode after you beat the game once through. The problem is that it\\'s pretty much the same, just harder.  The game has many secrets and unlockables that you can unlock but I won’t go into detail on that. All you have to do is kill Colossi in time attack mode. Every 2 Colossi you kill you get an item.  I may have missed some things but overall, the game is great and nothing should stop you from getting Shadow of the Colossus. It must obviously be good for me to write a review on it for two hours. So buy, or at least rent Shadow of the Colossus. It\\'s a great game and a must play for everyone (even though it\\'s rated T for teen).',\n",

       "  'description': \"Summer is finally here and with it comes another season of tennis, as the pros take to the courts to amaze and delight us. It's also the perfect time for game companies to release their take on the sport, for those of us who enjoy playing tennis with a controller instead of a racket.  Top Spin 3, from publisher 2K Sports and developer Pam Development, is the third game in the Top Spin series and the only tennis game scheduled for this summer. Unlike other games from other publishers before it, Top Spin 3 is not an arcade-based tennis game, thus making it a bit challenging for casual players. Luckily, there's a Top Spin School where you'll learn all of the moves and tricks to help you get accustomed to the controls, and when you do, they feel very sharp and accurate. The controls are quite basic in nature. The face buttons perform flat, top spin, slice and lob/drop shots while the triggers give that extra 'oomph' of power to them. The shoulder buttons make your player sprint across the court. Although learning how your player hits and moves isn't overly complicated, the timing of your button presses can be a bit tricky. You'll need to press and hold down a face button to power up your swing, move the left analog stick to position it, and then release the button to hit the ball. Believe me, this takes some getting used to and a lot of practice, but when you get the hang of it, you'll soon understand why there's no better tennis game out there that imitates the real-life sport as well as Top Spin 3 does.  Aside from the tutorial game mode featured in the Top Spin School, you'll have four other modes to choose from. There's Exhibition, as well as online and offline multiplayer, which are pretty self-explanatory. Just know that the online multiplayer is lag-free, that it's easy to get into a match and that it can be played in singles or doubles competition. But the biggest draw of the game by far is the Career mode, where you'll take your player through five stages including amateur, challenger, junior, pro and legend. The game has a pretty hefty player creator mode, with tons of customizable options to choose from. Playing as yourself in a tournament where you kick Roger Federer's ass is surprisingly gratifying.  As you play through your career and win matches, you'll unlock experience points, which can be used to upgrade your player's abilities, which range from your forehand and backhand shots, as well as your service, stamina and power, amongst others. You'll also unlock other points which will allow you to buy clothes, shoes or rackets from the stores at the mall. All of the well-known brand names are there, including Nike and Adidas. Although the clothes look damn nice (for the most part), they do not influence your abilities or how the game is played, which is kind of a bummer, but I'm guessing that a company like Yonex didn't want to see their sneakers be out-performed by Nike sneakers, for example.  While you claw your way up to the top of the tennis food chain, you'll come across most of the well-known players of today, including Federer, Maria Sharapova, Andy Roddick and Amelie Moresmo, amongst others, as well as stars from yesteryear such as Monica Seles and Bjorn Borg. If you expect to go one on one with this year's Wimbledon winner, Rafael Nadal, you'll be disappointed to learn that he only appears on the PlayStation 3 version of the game due to contractual constraints. Most of the popular tournaments are featured in the game, including the US Open and the French Open but sadly, Wimbledon is not present.  One thing's for certain, this is by far the best looking tennis game on the market. The players are amazingly lifelike and their animations are fluid. The locales where the tournaments take place are varied and unique, from beach clubs to indoor gymnasiums, and everywhere in between. I also noticed that the crowds look and react like real crowds do, which is very rare for a sports game. Usually, you'll see the same looped animation over and over again while you're playing a match, which can get pretty annoying at times, so kudos to 2K for creating the best AI crowd in the business. Top Spin 3 also sounds great. You'll know when you're hitting a powerful shot or a weak one from the sound the ball makes when you smack it with your racket. The ambiance is also very noticeable, as you'll barely hear a clap or a yell when you're playing in lower-level tournaments, compared to the roar of the crowd when you hit the big time. There is a very limited soundtrack in the game, but it's nothing to write home about, especially since the same 2-3 songs seem to loop ad nauseam. There's just so much Jamiroquai a man can take before cringing, you know?  If you have the patience to tough it out, Top Spin 3 is a very solid game of tennis which takes itself very seriously. It offers a realistic, no-holds-barred take on the sport which will have fans craving for more. This game offers so much tennis, with solid career and online modes to boot, that you'll be playing it for a very long time to come. Bottom line, if you love tennis, you'll love Top Spin 3.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"This review of an Xbox 360 game ain't what you were expectin'. However no one was expecting a good shooter based on New York gang tensions from the same studio in Sweden that brought us that one Xbox game that was better than the actual movie. Anyone remember The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay? This time, instead of being based on a movie, The Darkness is based on an old comic book, published by Marvel, of the same name.  Set in a fictional section of New York, the story takes place following the events surrounding a young contract killer named Tony Estacado. On his 21st birthday Tony is fulfilling a contract for the Frachetti crime family when something goes sour on the deal. Driving back home, Tony and company are trapped inside the downtown tunnel going 90 mph in the wrong direction. Needless to say they crash and Mikey, the driver, dies at the wreck site. Surviving unharmed, Tony proceeds with his contract to “whack” a construction site foreman when things go even worse. The mob boss, “Uncle” Paulie has already had someone kill the foreman, and when you get to the top well....there's a bit of a surprise waiting for you. The entire game that follows is a whirlwind adventure following Jackie Estacado and The Darkness, which is a demonic possession that takes a hold of the first-born male member on his 21st birthday. Jackie, whose birthday could not have gone any worse, gets caught up in not only his family's cave-in but his own Darkness as well.  Perhaps a first in any first-person shooter is the notion of an open-world environment where, as the character, you can visit any available location in the game. Only if areas are blocked off or restricted for mission-specific purposes are you unable to go anywhere in the game. The fictional New York the game is set in feels very limited given the potential scope of that city and having only a couple blocks per street available seems very restrictive. However, due to cutting in and out to large-scale war scenes (won't go into too much detail for spoilers) and back again several times throughout the game gives it a larger sense of scale than it would if it did not.  The ability to travel between these areas in the game lends to scale, but more importantly, allows for more sensible back-tracking that's needed for the story to be told properly. Needless to say there is a bit of motivation as you attempt to take your former employer for setting you up on the construction site hit and as such you'll be running back and forth through these locations quite often. Luckily they are set up identically to real-life city streets so navigating them is a breeze if you remember which intersection goes where. Getting easily sidetracked by your own Darkness, the game is half gun-play and half learning how to use these darkness powers properly. It's hard to describe a game that really doesn't fit into any category established before. Sure it's a first-person shooter like anything else, but The Darkness powers allow for some interesting puzzle solving and there are also platform elements in the game.  As you progress with your plans to take down Uncle Paulie and the corrupt cop Eddie Shrote, you'll be cutting in and out of World War One, which is a narrow (almost corridor) sequence that takes place inside Jackie's mind or The Darkness, it's not clear, however these sequences bridge portions of the game and allow for some intricate story telling. Allowing Jackie to wake up places that he wasn't before, etc.  One thing that The Darkness really has going for it is the interesting use of The Darkness itself. The first power you acquire immediately after your 21st birthday occurs at the same time The Darkness manifests itself. This power, called “crawling dark” is a vine-like tentacle-with-a-head that Jackie can use for stealth killing or to (more commonly) crawling through air ducts or under gates to unlock a door on the other side or pick up a key. The power is also good for taking ammo out of dangerous locations that are still under fire. The “crawling dark” is Jackie's most stealth weapon and most useful more times than not.  The “demon arm” is the second power Jakie acquires shortly after visiting WWI for the first time. The demon arm is extremely helpful for putting out those pesky lights that you'd otherwise be shooting at without expending any ammo. But perhaps the most obvious use of the power is to move large obstacles out of the way or to fling them at enemies. Alternatively, simply tapping “RB” will impale the nearest enemy on the demon arm instantly killing them, but the range is very limited.  The Darkness guns are perhaps the most lack lust Darkness power to speak of, simply a pistol and what appears to be a handheld gauss rifle that simply use the Darkness energy as ammo. The black hole power is simply the most powerful (and some would call it cheap) power in the game. It consumes the entire supply of Darkness energy (which protects you from bullets so watch out when you use this power) and generates a black hole, pulling everything and anyone into it besides yourself killing them instantly upon touching the center of the black hole. Like I said, cheap but lethally effective.  These powers combined create a new challenge in a strategic sense, but then again add a depth to an otherwise average shooter. Throw in some amazing mafia-esque voice talent and that creates the perfect recipe for success. The Darkness powers combined with tense gun play and a great sound cast make The Darkness one of the best Xbox 360 games out this year.\",\n",

       "  'description': \" -- Transmission Received -- When Metroid Prime debuted back in 2001 for the Gamecube no one could have foreseen the unmistakable impact that the game had on all other shooters since its release. Many developers have tried, but none have succeeded where Retro Studios has in making a compelling game world as rich as Metroid's. Playing as the female bounty hunter Samus Aran, alone in the universe to uncover secrets of ancient alien species and mysteries. Starting in the first game with the Tallon IV incident and continued on a compelling sequel to unearth more answers with even more questions on a world split in two, Samus is called upon for the riskiest mission she's ever undertaken. A mission that could mean the end to the pirate threat – or danger to the entire universe. Only you can take the journey this fall, on the Nintendo Wii.  The game opens in the same reasonably tame manner you've come to expect from a Metroid game, giving the same air of vacancy in the universe when suddenly you're overtaking a huge fleet of warships identified as the Galactic Federation. For the first time in a Metroid game you'll actually get to see and hear the characters behind your contracts. While the voice acting seems relatively poor for more of the actors given some of the games with some great voicing in them, (The Darkness and Gears of War), it's passable but not by much. Most of the voice cast seems to have little acting experience and carries the feel of the dialog poorly, which is a shame because the opening cinematic would be memorable otherwise. However, the voice of the Aurora Unit and Sargent were noticeably well done. In terms of other audio design, Corruption is simply flawless to the untrained ear. All typical sounds you expect to hear in a Metroid game are back, well updated and others added and glossed over to feel very Metroid at heart. I was pleased that all missing music from Echoes was masterfully re-implemented (such as the overworld theme and the space pirate attack song).  Once you get your orders everything goes to hell and the G.F.S. Valhalla is attacked and the game begins! Corruption embraces the same opening structure as the original Metroid Prime planting you on a sinking ship and then thrusting you into a world with no directions. Once you make planetfall however everything changes, you're then given instructions throughout the rest of the game via a comm system with actual spoken dialog instead of just a computer readout (don't worry, the readouts are still there). Which is depressing since the lure of Metroid (at least from my perspective) is the amazing sense of being completely alone in the world which is usually conveyed with a sense of destruction and abandonment – something that is hard to do if you are interacting with other characters, but it certainly does lend to the realism. Samus would certainly receive mission-critical updates from the authority that hires her.  Yet another first in the series, in the beginning of the game after you escape from the sinking ship the Valhalla you land on the nearby planet where a Galactic Federation outpost has been constructed you'll do battle with space-pirates alongside 3 other bounty hunters that will mysteriously disappear once some stuff happens (and you'll get through the PED suit craziness) and makes for interesting encounters throughout the course of the entire game. A new feature for any Metroid game previously released is an AI that aids you. Rather than a Halo-esque single AI unit like Cortana, Corruption features multiple linked AI entities that act as a single intelligence. These beings are unlike most (if not all) game intelligences seen before in gaming, they are organic beings. Called Aurora Units these semi-synthetic beings act as self-aware super-computers able to process and analyze data as you gather it during your adventure. This also allows a more realistic approach to how Samus discovers information about weapons caches and Chozo technology. Speaking of the Chozo, while they are not the focal point or a side investigation via hieroglyphics, there are many amazing Chozo locations spread across many areas that Samus will investigate throughout the course of the entire game. This far exceeds the previous games in terms of scope. Spanning a spaceship, a planet and a town floating in the sky (with a couple more surprises) this is by far the most expansive Metroid game ever. Not only expansive but each area has a singular and distinct feel. By the time the game is over, you'll feel as if you have covered quite a bit of ground. Mainly since for the first time ever, you'll be able to move your ship from place to place on command as well as use it for air-strikes amongst other things which expand the feeling of depth on a planetary scale.  With all the space to explore, many were concerned with the graphics from previews shown the on the internet and at E3, it was said that it looked no better on the Wii than on the Gamecube. Unfortunately, the true beauty of Metroid can only be seen in person on a widescreen 480p TV screen. Unlike previous installments, the graphics are crisp, clean, and looked anti-aliased to an extend we haven't seen on Wii games yet. Most noticeably, without looking at the textures and environments – particles and effects will jump out at you and make you pay attention to them. These effects are much more advanced than anything possible on the Gamecube. A benefit that the Wii has, that the 360 and PS3 certainly do not, is the ability to run a first-person shooter at an easy 60 frames a second with dozens of characters on-screen with rapid aiming movement and no image-tearing by the GPU. Someone playing Metroid Prime 3: Corruption may not notice, but going from that to The Darkness or a Tom Clancy game is a noticeable difference, even Gears of War looks slow by comparison. Like any exploration she's had in the past, Samus will face enemies like she's never seen before. As you would imagine, controls would be an issue for any game developers, any but Retro Studios that is. Seemingly painstaking options for controls were given for any playing style. Newcomers can have a watered down system for a lock-on fire mode simply by holding the “Z” Button, while people familiar or able to quickly adapt to the Wiimote controls can have 2 other (aim speeds vary on these) control options. These last two options allow for independent aiming while having a target lock which allows for the most precise aiming and movement.  Since the Wii is the only machine that you can make a game where the shooting is the most fun and the most involving, they made the enemies much more difficult because as a result, were more fun to fight. When you see a space pirate or two coming at you instead of blowing them off with a couple rockets, they'll roll to the side, flank and try to pin you down in a very fun and a very overwhelming “oh sh*t” moment. Unfortunately, the studio decided to forgo a multiplayer mode of any type in the third installment of the series, deciding to focus the efforts on a geat single-player adventure. While the studio successed without question, it is regrettable and dissapointing that when Nintendo finally decided to include an online structure in their system – one of the biggest titles this year would ignore it. All is not lost, Corruption is not only of the largest games in the franchise, it is also one of the longest. Initial play-throughs of the game yeilded nothing under 23 hours of game time – although I'm more than sure some people out there will finish it in around 20 hours, I can easily see a more casual approach taking 25-30 hours to complete.  With all things said and done, Metroid Prime 3 successfully trumps the original Metroid Prime as the most impressive and expansive action-shooter of all time. Even the (still) iffy principal of having other bounty hunters to deal with, the story was delivered with as many twists and turns as you could expect from any Metroid game you've ever played before. This review can't even begin to cover half of the new and amazing title from Retro Studios.  ** Some of the content in this review has been specifically glanced over or detail has been omitted to prevent the public from spoilers or story elements ** \",\n",
